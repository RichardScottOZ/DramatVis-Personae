       "' 1\\n\\n\\nHappy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its\\nown way.\\n\\nEverything was in confusion in the Oblonskys’ house. The wife had\\ndiscovered that the husband was carrying on an intrigue with a French\\ngirl, who had been a governess in their family, and she had announced\\nto her husband that she could not go on living in the same house with\\nhim. This position of affairs had now lasted three days, and not only\\nthe husband and wife themselves, but all the members of their family\\nand household, were painfully conscious of it. Every person in the\\nhouse felt that there was no sense in their living together, and that\\nthe stray people brought together by chance in any inn had more in\\ncommon with one another than they, the members of the family and\\nhousehold of the Oblonskys. The wife did not leave her own room, the\\nhusband had not been at home for three days. The children ran wild all\\nover the house; the English governess quarreled with the housekeeper,\\nand wrote to a friend asking her to look out for a new situation for\\nher; the man-cook had walked off the day before just at dinner time;\\nthe kitchen-maid, and the coachman had given warning.\\n\\nThree days after the quarrel, Prince Stepan Arkadyevitch\\nOblonsky—Stiva, as he was called in the fashionable world—woke up at\\nhis usual hour, that is, at eight o’clock in the morning, not in his\\nwife’s bedroom, but on the leather-covered sofa in his study. He turned\\nover his stout, well-cared-for person on the springy sofa, as though he\\nwould sink into a long sleep again; he vigorously embraced the pillow\\non the other side and buried his face in it; but all at once he jumped\\nup, sat up on the sofa, and opened his eyes.\\n\\n“Yes, yes, how was it now?” he thought, going over his dream. “Now, how\\nwas it? To be sure! Alabin was giving a dinner at Darmstadt; no, not\\nDarmstadt, but something American. Yes, but then, Darmstadt was in\\nAmerica. Yes, Alabin was giving a dinner on glass tables, and the\\ntables sang, _Il mio tesoro_—not _Il mio tesoro_ though, but something\\nbetter, and there were some sort of little decanters on the table, and\\nthey were women, too,” he remembered.\\n\\nStepan Arkadyevitch’s eyes twinkled gaily, and he pondered with a\\nsmile. “Yes, it was nice, very nice. There was a great deal more that\\nwas delightful, only there’s no putting it into words, or even\\nexpressing it in one’s thoughts awake.” And noticing a gleam of light\\npeeping in beside one of the serge curtains, he cheerfully dropped his\\nfeet over the edge of the sofa, and felt about with them for his\\nslippers, a present on his last birthday, worked for him by his wife on\\ngold-colored morocco. And, as he had done every day for the last nine\\nyears, he stretched out his hand, without getting up, towards the place\\nwhere his dressing-gown always hung in his bedroom. And thereupon he\\nsuddenly remembered that he was not sleeping in his wife’s room, but in\\nhis study, and why: the smile vanished from his face, he knitted his\\nbrows.\\n\\n“Ah, ah, ah! Oo!...” he muttered, recalling everything that had\\nhappened. And again every detail of his quarrel with his wife was\\npresent to his imagination, all the hopelessness of his position, and\\nworst of all, his own fault.\\n\\n“Yes, she won’t forgive me, and she can’t forgive me. And the most\\nawful thing about it is that it’s all my fault—all my fault, though I’m\\nnot to blame. That’s the point of the whole situation,” he reflected.\\n“Oh, oh, oh!” he kept repeating in despair, as he remembered the\\nacutely painful sensations caused him by this quarrel.\\n\\nMost unpleasant of all was the first minute when, on coming, happy and\\ngood-humored, from the theater, with a huge pear in his hand for his\\nwife, he had not found his wife in the drawing-room, to his surprise\\nhad not found her in the study either, and saw her at last in her\\nbedroom with the unlucky letter that revealed everything in her hand.\\n\\nShe, his Dolly, forever fussing and worrying over household details,\\nand limited in her ideas, as he considered, was sitting perfectly still\\nwith the letter in her hand, looking at him with an expression of\\nhorror, despair, and indignation.\\n\\n“What’s this? this?” she asked, pointing to the letter.\\n\\nAnd at this recollection, Stepan Arkadyevitch, as is so often the case,\\nwas not so much annoyed at the fact itself as at the way in which he\\nhad met his wife’s words.\\n\\nThere happened to him at that instant what does happen to people when\\nthey are unexpectedly caught in something very disgraceful. He did not\\nsucceed in adapting his face to the position in which he was placed\\ntowards his wife by the discovery of his fault. Instead of being hurt,\\ndenying, defending himself, begging forgiveness, instead of remaining\\nindifferent even—anything would have been better than what he did\\ndo—his face utterly involuntarily (reflex spinal action, reflected\\nStepan Arkadyevitch, who was fond of physiology)—utterly involuntarily\\nassumed its habitual, good-humored, and therefore idiotic smile.\\n\\nThis idiotic smile he could not forgive himself. Catching sight of that\\nsmile, Dolly shuddered as though at physical pain, broke out with her\\ncharacteristic heat into a flood of cruel words, and rushed out of the\\nroom. Since then she had refused to see her husband.\\n\\n“It’s that idiotic smile that’s to blame for it all,” thought Stepan\\nArkadyevitch.\\n\\n“But what’s to be done? What’s to be done?” he said to himself in\\ndespair, and found no answer 2\\n\\nStepan Arkadyevitch was a truthful man in his relations with himself.\\nHe was incapable of deceiving himself and persuading himself that he\\nrepented of his conduct. He could not at this date repent of the fact\\nthat he, a handsome, susceptible man of thirty-four, was not in love\\nwith his wife, the mother of five living and two dead children, and\\nonly a year younger than himself. All he repented of was that he had\\nnot succeeded better in hiding it from his wife. But he felt all the\\ndifficulty of his position and was sorry for his wife, his children,\\nand himself. Possibly he might have managed to conceal his sins better\\nfrom his wife if he had anticipated that the knowledge of them would\\nhave had such an effect on her. He had never clearly thought out the\\nsubject, but he had vaguely conceived that his wife must long ago have\\nsuspected him of being unfaithful to her, and shut her eyes to the\\nfact. He had even supposed that she, a worn-out woman no longer young\\nor good-looking, and in no way remarkable or interesting, merely a good\\nmother, ought from a sense of fairness to take an indulgent view. It\\nhad turned out quite the other way.\\n\\n“Oh, it’s awful! oh dear, oh dear! awful!” Stepan Arkadyevitch kept\\nrepeating to himself, and he could think of nothing to be done. “And\\nhow well things were going up till now! how well we got on! She was\\ncontented and happy in her children; I never interfered with her in\\nanything; I let her manage the children and the house just as she\\nliked. It’s true it’s bad _her_ having been a governess in our house.\\nThat’s bad! There’s something common, vulgar, in flirting with one’s\\ngoverness. But what a governess!” (He vividly recalled the roguish\\nblack eyes of Mlle. Roland and her smile.) “But after all, while she\\nwas in the house, I kept myself in hand. And the worst of it all is\\nthat she’s already ... it seems as if ill-luck would have it so! Oh,\\noh! But what, what is to be done?”\\n\\nThere was no solution, but that universal solution which life gives to\\nall questions, even the most complex and insoluble. That answer is: one\\nmust live in the needs of the day—that is, forget oneself. To forget\\nhimself in sleep was impossible now, at least till nighttime; he could\\nnot go back now to the music sung by the decanter-women; so he must\\nforget himself in the dream of daily life.\\n\\n“Then we shall see,” Stepan Arkadyevitch said to himself, and getting\\nup he put on a gray dressing-gown lined with blue silk, tied the\\ntassels in a knot, and, drawing a deep breath of air into his broad,\\nbare chest, he walked to the window with his usual confident step,\\nturning out his feet that carried his full frame so easily. He pulled\\nup the blind and rang the bell loudly. It was at once answered by the\\nappearance of an old friend, his valet, Matvey, carrying his clothes,\\nhis boots, and a telegram. Matvey was followed by the barber with all\\nthe necessaries for shaving.\\n\\n“Are there any papers from the office?” asked Stepan Arkadyevitch,\\ntaking the telegram and seating himself at the looking-glass.\\n\\n“On the table,” replied Matvey, glancing with inquiring sympathy at his\\nmaster; and, after a short pause, he added with a sly smile, “They’ve\\nsent from the carriage-jobbers.”\\n\\nStepan Arkadyevitch made no reply, he merely glanced at Matvey in the\\nlooking-glass. In the glance, in which their eyes met in the\\nlooking-glass, it was clear that they understood one another. Stepan\\nArkadyevitch’s eyes asked: “Why do you tell me that? don’t you know?”\\n\\nMatvey put his hands in his jacket pockets, thrust out one leg, and\\ngazed silently, good-humoredly, with a faint smile, at his master.\\n\\n“I told them to come on Sunday, and till then not to trouble you or\\nthemselves for nothing,” he said. He had obviously prepared the\\nsentence beforehand.\\n\\nStepan Arkadyevitch saw Matvey wanted to make a joke and attract\\nattention to himself. Tearing open the telegram, he read it through,\\nguessing at the words, misspelt as they always are in telegrams, and\\nhis face brightened.\\n\\n“Matvey, my sister Anna Arkadyevna will be here tomorrow,” he said,\\nchecking for a minute the sleek, plump hand of the barber, cutting a\\npink path through his long, curly whiskers.\\n\\n“Thank God!” said Matvey, showing by this response that he, like his\\nmaster, realized the significance of this arrival—that is, that Anna\\nArkadyevna, the sister he was so fond of, might bring about a\\nreconciliation between husband and wife.\\n\\n“Alone, or with her husband?” inquired Matvey.\\n\\nStepan Arkadyevitch could not answer, as the barber was at work on his\\nupper lip, and he raised one finger. Matvey nodded at the\\nlooking-glass.\\n\\n“Alone. Is the room to be got ready upstairs?”\\n\\n“Inform Darya Alexandrovna: where she orders.”\\n\\n“Darya Alexandrovna?” Matvey repeated, as though in doubt.\\n\\n“Yes, inform her. Here, take the telegram; give it to her, and then do\\nwhat she tells you.”\\n\\n“You want to try it on,” Matvey understood, but he only said, “Yes,\\nsir.”\\n\\nStepan Arkadyevitch was already washed and combed and ready to be\\ndressed, when Matvey, stepping deliberately in his creaky boots, came\\nback into the room with the telegram in his hand. The barber had gone.\\n\\n“Darya Alexandrovna told me to inform you that she is going away. Let\\nhim do—that is you—as he likes,” he said, laughing only with his eyes,\\nand putting his hands in his pockets, he watched his master with his\\nhead on one side. Stepan Arkadyevitch was silent a minute. Then a\\ngood-humored and rather pitiful smile showed itself on his handsome\\nface.\\n\\n“Eh, Matvey?” he said, shaking his head.\\n\\n“It’s all right, sir; she will come round,” said Matvey.\\n\\n“Come round?”\\n\\n“Yes, sir.”\\n\\n“Do you think so? Who’s there?” asked Stepan Arkadyevitch, hearing the\\nrustle of a woman’s dress at the door.\\n\\n“It’s I,” said a firm, pleasant, woman’s voice, and the stern,\\npockmarked face of Matrona Philimonovna, the nurse, was thrust in at\\nthe doorway.\\n\\n“Well, what is it, Matrona?” queried Stepan Arkadyevitch, going up to\\nher at the door.\\n\\nAlthough Stepan Arkadyevitch was completely in the wrong as regards his\\nwife, and was conscious of this himself, almost everyone in the house\\n(even the nurse, Darya Alexandrovna’s chief ally) was on his side.\\n\\n“Well, what now?” he asked disconsolately.\\n\\n“Go to her, sir; own your fault again. Maybe God will aid you. She is\\nsuffering so, it’s sad to see her; and besides, everything in the house\\nis topsy-turvy. You must have pity, sir, on the children. Beg her\\nforgiveness, sir. There’s no help for it! One must take the\\nconsequences....”\\n\\n“But she won’t see me.”\\n\\n“You do your part. God is merciful; pray to God, sir, pray to God.”\\n\\n“Come, that’ll do, you can go,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, blushing\\nsuddenly. “Well now, do dress me.” He turned to Matvey and threw off\\nhis dressing-gown decisively.\\n\\nMatvey was already holding up the shirt like a horse’s collar, and,\\nblowing off some invisible speck, he slipped it with obvious pleasure\\nover the well-groomed body of his master 3\\n\\nWhen he was dressed, Stepan Arkadyevitch sprinkled some scent on\\nhimself, pulled down his shirt-cuffs, distributed into his pockets his\\ncigarettes, pocketbook, matches, and watch with its double chain and\\nseals, and shaking out his handkerchief, feeling himself clean,\\nfragrant, healthy, and physically at ease, in spite of his unhappiness,\\nhe walked with a slight swing on each leg into the dining-room, where\\ncoffee was already waiting for him, and beside the coffee, letters and\\npapers from the office.\\n\\nHe read the letters. One was very unpleasant, from a merchant who was\\nbuying a forest on his wife’s property. To sell this forest was\\nabsolutely essential; but at present, until he was reconciled with his\\nwife, the subject could not be discussed. The most unpleasant thing of\\nall was that his pecuniary interests should in this way enter into the\\nquestion of his reconciliation with his wife. And the idea that he\\nmight be led on by his interests, that he might seek a reconciliation\\nwith his wife on account of the sale of the forest—that idea hurt him.\\n\\nWhen he had finished his letters, Stepan Arkadyevitch moved the\\noffice-papers close to him, rapidly looked through two pieces of\\nbusiness, made a few notes with a big pencil, and pushing away the\\npapers, turned to his coffee. As he sipped his coffee, he opened a\\nstill damp morning paper, and began reading it.\\n\\nStepan Arkadyevitch took in and read a liberal paper, not an extreme\\none, but one advocating the views held by the majority. And in spite of\\nthe fact that science, art, and politics had no special interest for\\nhim, he firmly held those views on all these subjects which were held\\nby the majority and by his paper, and he only changed them when the\\nmajority changed them—or, more strictly speaking, he did not change\\nthem, but they imperceptibly changed of themselves within him.\\n\\nStepan Arkadyevitch had not chosen his political opinions or his views;\\nthese political opinions and views had come to him of themselves, just\\nas he did not choose the shapes of his hat and coat, but simply took\\nthose that were being worn. And for him, living in a certain\\nsociety—owing to the need, ordinarily developed at years of discretion,\\nfor some degree of mental activity—to have views was just as\\nindispensable as to have a hat. If there was a reason for his\\npreferring liberal to conservative views, which were held also by many\\nof his circle, it arose not from his considering liberalism more\\nrational, but from its being in closer accordance with his manner of\\nlife. The liberal party said that in Russia everything is wrong, and\\ncertainly Stepan Arkadyevitch had many debts and was decidedly short of\\nmoney. The liberal party said that marriage is an institution quite out\\nof date, and that it needs reconstruction; and family life certainly\\nafforded Stepan Arkadyevitch little gratification, and forced him into\\nlying and hypocrisy, which was so repulsive to his nature. The liberal\\nparty said, or rather allowed it to be understood, that religion is\\nonly a curb to keep in check the barbarous classes of the people; and\\nStepan Arkadyevitch could not get through even a short service without\\nhis legs aching from standing up, and could never make out what was the\\nobject of all the terrible and high-flown language about another world\\nwhen life might be so very amusing in this world. And with all this,\\nStepan Arkadyevitch, who liked a joke, was fond of puzzling a plain man\\nby saying that if he prided himself on his origin, he ought not to stop\\nat Rurik and disown the first founder of his family—the monkey. And so\\nLiberalism had become a habit of Stepan Arkadyevitch’s, and he liked\\nhis newspaper, as he did his cigar after dinner, for the slight fog it\\ndiffused in his brain. He read the leading article, in which it was\\nmaintained that it was quite senseless in our day to raise an outcry\\nthat radicalism was threatening to swallow up all conservative\\nelements, and that the government ought to take measures to crush the\\nrevolutionary hydra; that, on the contrary, “in our opinion the danger\\nlies not in that fantastic revolutionary hydra, but in the obstinacy of\\ntraditionalism clogging progress,” etc., etc. He read another article,\\ntoo, a financial one, which alluded to Bentham and Mill, and dropped\\nsome innuendoes reflecting on the ministry. With his characteristic\\nquickwittedness he caught the drift of each innuendo, divined whence it\\ncame, at whom and on what ground it was aimed, and that afforded him,\\nas it always did, a certain satisfaction. But today that satisfaction\\nwas embittered by Matrona Philimonovna’s advice and the unsatisfactory\\nstate of the household. He read, too, that Count Beist was rumored to\\nhave left for Wiesbaden, and that one need have no more gray hair, and\\nof the sale of a light carriage, and of a young person seeking a\\nsituation; but these items of information did not give him, as usual, a\\nquiet, ironical gratification. Having finished the paper, a second cup\\nof coffee and a roll and butter, he got up, shaking the crumbs of the\\nroll off his waistcoat; and, squaring his broad chest, he smiled\\njoyously: not because there was anything particularly agreeable in his\\nmind—the joyous smile was evoked by a good digestion.\\n\\nBut this joyous smile at once recalled everything to him, and he grew\\nthoughtful.\\n\\nTwo childish voices (Stepan Arkadyevitch recognized the voices of\\nGrisha, his youngest boy, and Tanya, his eldest girl) were heard\\noutside the door. They were carrying something, and dropped it.\\n\\n“I told you not to sit passengers on the roof,” said the little girl in\\nEnglish; “there, pick them up!”\\n\\n“Everything’s in confusion,” thought Stepan Arkadyevitch; “there are\\nthe children running about by themselves.” And going to the door, he\\ncalled them. They threw down the box, that represented a train, and\\ncame in to their father.\\n\\nThe little girl, her father’s favorite, ran up boldly, embraced him,\\nand hung laughingly on his neck, enjoying as she always did the smell\\nof scent that came from his whiskers. At last the little girl kissed\\nhis face, which was flushed from his stooping posture and beaming with\\ntenderness, loosed her hands, and was about to run away again; but her\\nfather held her back.\\n\\n“How is mamma?” he asked, passing his hand over his daughter’s smooth,\\nsoft little neck. “Good morning,” he said, smiling to the boy, who had\\ncome up to greet him. He was conscious that he loved the boy less, and\\nalways tried to be fair; but the boy felt it, and did not respond with\\na smile to his father’s chilly smile.\\n\\n“Mamma? She is up,” answered the girl.\\n\\nStepan Arkadyevitch sighed. “That means that she’s not slept again all\\nnight,” he thought.\\n\\n“Well, is she cheerful?”\\n\\nThe little girl knew that there was a quarrel between her father and\\nmother, and that her mother could not be cheerful, and that her father\\nmust be aware of this, and that he was pretending when he asked about\\nit so lightly. And she blushed for her father. He at once perceived it,\\nand blushed too.\\n\\n“I don’t know,” she said. “She did not say we must do our lessons, but\\nshe said we were to go for a walk with Miss Hoole to grandmamma’s.”\\n\\n“Well, go, Tanya, my darling. Oh, wait a minute, though,” he said,\\nstill holding her and stroking her soft little hand.\\n\\nHe took off the mantelpiece, where he had put it yesterday, a little\\nbox of sweets, and gave her two, picking out her favorites, a chocolate\\nand a fondant.\\n\\n“For Grisha?” said the little girl, pointing to the chocolate.\\n\\n“Yes, yes.” And still stroking her little shoulder, he kissed her on\\nthe roots of her hair and neck, and let her go.\\n\\n“The carriage is ready,” said Matvey; “but there’s someone to see you\\nwith a petition.”\\n\\n“Been here long?” asked Stepan Arkadyevitch.\\n\\n“Half an hour.”\\n\\n“How many times have I told you to tell me at once?”\\n\\n“One must let you drink your coffee in peace, at least,” said Matvey,\\nin the affectionately gruff tone with which it was impossible to be\\nangry.\\n\\n“Well, show the person up at once,” said Oblonsky, frowning with\\nvexation.\\n\\nThe petitioner, the widow of a staff captain Kalinin, came with a\\nrequest impossible and unreasonable; but Stepan Arkadyevitch, as he\\ngenerally did, made her sit down, heard her to the end attentively\\nwithout interrupting her, and gave her detailed advice as to how and to\\nwhom to apply, and even wrote her, in his large, sprawling, good and\\nlegible hand, a confident and fluent little note to a personage who\\nmight be of use to her. Having got rid of the staff captain’s widow,\\nStepan Arkadyevitch took his hat and stopped to recollect whether he\\nhad forgotten anything. It appeared that he had forgotten nothing\\nexcept what he wanted to forget—his wife.\\n\\n“Ah, yes!” He bowed his head, and his handsome face assumed a harassed\\nexpression. “To go, or not to go!” he said to himself; and an inner\\nvoice told him he must not go, that nothing could come of it but\\nfalsity; that to amend, to set right their relations was impossible,\\nbecause it was impossible to make her attractive again and able to\\ninspire love, or to make him an old man, not susceptible to love.\\nExcept deceit and lying nothing could come of it now; and deceit and\\nlying were opposed to his nature.\\n\\n“It must be some time, though: it can’t go on like this,” he said,\\ntrying to give himself courage. He squared his chest, took out a\\ncigarette, took two whiffs at it, flung it into a mother-of-pearl\\nashtray, and with rapid steps walked through the drawing-room, and\\nopened the other door into his wife’s bedroom 4\\n\\nDarya Alexandrovna, in a dressing jacket, and with her now scanty, once\\nluxuriant and beautiful hair fastened up with hairpins on the nape of\\nher neck, with a sunken, thin face and large, startled eyes, which\\nlooked prominent from the thinness of her face, was standing among a\\nlitter of all sorts of things scattered all over the room, before an\\nopen bureau, from which she was taking something. Hearing her husband’s\\nsteps, she stopped, looking towards the door, and trying assiduously to\\ngive her features a severe and contemptuous expression. She felt she\\nwas afraid of him, and afraid of the coming interview. She was just\\nattempting to do what she had attempted to do ten times already in\\nthese last three days—to sort out the children’s things and her own, so\\nas to take them to her mother’s—and again she could not bring herself\\nto do this; but now again, as each time before, she kept saying to\\nherself, “that things cannot go on like this, that she must take some\\nstep” to punish him, put him to shame, avenge on him some little part\\nat least of the suffering he had caused her. She still continued to\\ntell herself that she should leave him, but she was conscious that this\\nwas impossible; it was impossible because she could not get out of the\\nhabit of regarding him as her husband and loving him. Besides this, she\\nrealized that if even here in her own house she could hardly manage to\\nlook after her five children properly, they would be still worse off\\nwhere she was going with them all. As it was, even in the course of\\nthese three days, the youngest was unwell from being given unwholesome\\nsoup, and the others had almost gone without their dinner the day\\nbefore. She was conscious that it was impossible to go away; but,\\ncheating herself, she went on all the same sorting out her things and\\npretending she was going.\\n\\nSeeing her husband, she dropped her hands into the drawer of the bureau\\nas though looking for something, and only looked round at him when he\\nhad come quite up to her. But her face, to which she tried to give a\\nsevere and resolute expression, betrayed bewilderment and suffering.\\n\\n“Dolly!” he said in a subdued and timid voice. He bent his head towards\\nhis shoulder and tried to look pitiful and humble, but for all that he\\nwas radiant with freshness and health. In a rapid glance she scanned\\nhis figure that beamed with health and freshness. “Yes, he is happy and\\ncontent!” she thought; “while I.... And that disgusting good nature,\\nwhich everyone likes him for and praises—I hate that good nature of\\nhis,” she thought. Her mouth stiffened, the muscles of the cheek\\ncontracted on the right side of her pale, nervous face.\\n\\n“What do you want?” she said in a rapid, deep, unnatural voice.\\n\\n“Dolly!” he repeated, with a quiver in his voice. “Anna is coming\\ntoday.”\\n\\n“Well, what is that to me? I can’t see her!” she cried.\\n\\n“But you must, really, Dolly....”\\n\\n“Go away, go away, go away!” she shrieked, not looking at him, as\\nthough this shriek were called up by physical pain.\\n\\nStepan Arkadyevitch could be calm when he thought of his wife, he could\\nhope that she would _come round_, as Matvey expressed it, and could\\nquietly go on reading his paper and drinking his coffee; but when he\\nsaw her tortured, suffering face, heard the tone of her voice,\\nsubmissive to fate and full of despair, there was a catch in his breath\\nand a lump in his throat, and his eyes began to shine with tears.\\n\\n“My God! what have I done? Dolly! For God’s sake!... You know....” He\\ncould not go on; there was a sob in his throat.\\n\\nShe shut the bureau with a slam, and glanced at him.\\n\\n“Dolly, what can I say?... One thing: forgive.... Remember, cannot nine\\nyears of my life atone for an instant....”\\n\\nShe dropped her eyes and listened, expecting what he would say, as it\\nwere beseeching him in some way or other to make her believe\\ndifferently.\\n\\n“—instant of passion?” he said, and would have gone on, but at that\\nword, as at a pang of physical pain, her lips stiffened again, and\\nagain the muscles of her right cheek worked.\\n\\n“Go away, go out of the room!” she shrieked still more shrilly, “and\\ndon’t talk to me of your passion and your loathsomeness.”\\n\\nShe tried to go out, but tottered, and clung to the back of a chair to\\nsupport herself. His face relaxed, his lips swelled, his eyes were\\nswimming with tears.\\n\\n“Dolly!” he said, sobbing now; “for mercy’s sake, think of the\\nchildren; they are not to blame! I am to blame, and punish me, make me\\nexpiate my fault. Anything I can do, I am ready to do anything! I am to\\nblame, no words can express how much I am to blame! But, Dolly, forgive\\nme!”\\n\\nShe sat down. He listened to her hard, heavy breathing, and he was\\nunutterably sorry for her. She tried several times to begin to speak,\\nbut could not. He waited.\\n\\n“You remember the children, Stiva, to play with them; but I remember\\nthem, and know that this means their ruin,” she said—obviously one of\\nthe phrases she had more than once repeated to herself in the course of\\nthe last few days.\\n\\nShe had called him “Stiva,” and he glanced at her with gratitude, and\\nmoved to take her hand, but she drew back from him with aversion.\\n\\n“I think of the children, and for that reason I would do anything in\\nthe world to save them, but I don’t myself know how to save them. By\\ntaking them away from their father, or by leaving them with a vicious\\nfather—yes, a vicious father.... Tell me, after what ... has happened,\\ncan we live together? Is that possible? Tell me, eh, is it possible?”\\nshe repeated, raising her voice, “after my husband, the father of my\\nchildren, enters into a love affair with his own children’s governess?”\\n\\n“But what could I do? what could I do?” he kept saying in a pitiful\\nvoice, not knowing what he was saying, as his head sank lower and\\nlower.\\n\\n“You are loathsome to me, repulsive!” she shrieked, getting more and\\nmore heated. “Your tears mean nothing! You have never loved me; you\\nhave neither heart nor honorable feeling! You are hateful to me,\\ndisgusting, a stranger—yes, a complete stranger!” With pain and wrath\\nshe uttered the word so terrible to herself—_stranger_.\\n\\nHe looked at her, and the fury expressed in her face alarmed and amazed\\nhim. He did not understand how his pity for her exasperated her. She\\nsaw in him sympathy for her, but not love. “No, she hates me. She will\\nnot forgive me,” he thought.\\n\\n“It is awful! awful!” he said.\\n\\nAt that moment in the next room a child began to cry; probably it had\\nfallen down. Darya Alexandrovna listened, and her face suddenly\\nsoftened.\\n\\nShe seemed to be pulling herself together for a few seconds, as though\\nshe did not know where she was, and what she was doing, and getting up\\nrapidly, she moved towards the door.\\n\\n“Well, she loves my child,” he thought, noticing the change of her face\\nat the child’s cry, “my child: how can she hate me?”\\n\\n“Dolly, one word more,” he said, following her.\\n\\n“If you come near me, I will call in the servants, the children! They\\nmay all know you are a scoundrel! I am going away at once, and you may\\nlive here with your mistress!”\\n\\nAnd she went out, slamming the door.\\n\\nStepan Arkadyevitch sighed, wiped his face, and with a subdued tread\\nwalked out of the room. “Matvey says she will come round; but how? I\\ndon’t see the least chance of it. Ah, oh, how horrible it is! And how\\nvulgarly she shouted,” he said to himself, remembering her shriek and\\nthe words—“scoundrel” and “mistress.” “And very likely the maids were\\nlistening! Horribly vulgar! horrible!” Stepan Arkadyevitch stood a few\\nseconds alone, wiped his face, squared his chest, and walked out of the\\nroom.\\n\\nIt was Friday, and in the dining-room the German watchmaker was winding\\nup the clock. Stepan Arkadyevitch remembered his joke about this\\npunctual, bald watchmaker, “that the German was wound up for a whole\\nlifetime himself, to wind up watches,” and he smiled. Stepan\\nArkadyevitch was fond of a joke: “And maybe she will come round! That’s\\na good expression, ‘_come round,_’” he thought. “I must repeat that.”\\n\\n“Matvey!” he shouted. “Arrange everything with Darya in the sitting\\nroom for Anna Arkadyevna,” he said to Matvey when he came in.\\n\\n“Yes, sir.”\\n\\nStepan Arkadyevitch put on his fur coat and went out onto the steps.\\n\\n“You won’t dine at home?” said Matvey, seeing him off.\\n\\n“That’s as it happens. But here’s for the housekeeping,” he said,\\ntaking ten roubles from his pocketbook. “That’ll be enough.”\\n\\n“Enough or not enough, we must make it do,” said Matvey, slamming the\\ncarriage door and stepping back onto the steps.\\n\\nDarya Alexandrovna meanwhile having pacified the child, and knowing\\nfrom the sound of the carriage that he had gone off, went back again to\\nher bedroom. It was her solitary refuge from the household cares which\\ncrowded upon her directly she went out from it. Even now, in the short\\ntime she had been in the nursery, the English governess and Matrona\\nPhilimonovna had succeeded in putting several questions to her, which\\ndid not admit of delay, and which only she could answer: “What were the\\nchildren to put on for their walk? Should they have any milk? Should\\nnot a new cook be sent for?”\\n\\n“Ah, let me alone, let me alone!” she said, and going back to her\\nbedroom she sat down in the same place as she had sat when talking to\\nher husband, clasping tightly her thin hands with the rings that\\nslipped down on her bony fingers, and fell to going over in her memory\\nall the conversation. “He has gone! But has he broken it off with her?”\\nshe thought. “Can it be he sees her? Why didn’t I ask him! No, no,\\nreconciliation is impossible. Even if we remain in the same house, we\\nare strangers—strangers forever!” She repeated again with special\\nsignificance the word so dreadful to her. “And how I loved him! my God,\\nhow I loved him!... How I loved him! And now don’t I love him? Don’t I\\nlove him more than before? The most horrible thing is,” she began, but\\ndid not finish her thought, because Matrona Philimonovna put her head\\nin at the door.\\n\\n“Let us send for my brother,” she said; “he can get a dinner anyway, or\\nwe shall have the children getting nothing to eat till six again, like\\nyesterday.”\\n\\n“Very well, I will come directly and see about it. But did you send for\\nsome new milk?”\\n\\nAnd Darya Alexandrovna plunged into the duties of the day, and drowned\\nher grief in them for a time 5\\n\\nStepan Arkadyevitch had learned easily at school, thanks to his\\nexcellent abilities, but he had been idle and mischievous, and\\ntherefore was one of the lowest in his class. But in spite of his\\nhabitually dissipated mode of life, his inferior grade in the service,\\nand his comparative youth, he occupied the honorable and lucrative\\nposition of president of one of the government boards at Moscow. This\\npost he had received through his sister Anna’s husband, Alexey\\nAlexandrovitch Karenin, who held one of the most important positions in\\nthe ministry to whose department the Moscow office belonged. But if\\nKarenin had not got his brother-in-law this berth, then through a\\nhundred other personages—brothers, sisters, cousins, uncles, and\\naunts—Stiva Oblonsky would have received this post, or some other\\nsimilar one, together with the salary of six thousand absolutely\\nneedful for him, as his affairs, in spite of his wife’s considerable\\nproperty, were in an embarrassed condition.\\n\\nHalf Moscow and Petersburg were friends and relations of Stepan\\nArkadyevitch. He was born in the midst of those who had been and are\\nthe powerful ones of this world. One-third of the men in the\\ngovernment, the older men, had been friends of his father’s, and had\\nknown him in petticoats; another third were his intimate chums, and the\\nremainder were friendly acquaintances. Consequently the distributors of\\nearthly blessings in the shape of places, rents, shares, and such, were\\nall his friends, and could not overlook one of their own set; and\\nOblonsky had no need to make any special exertion to get a lucrative\\npost. He had only not to refuse things, not to show jealousy, not to be\\nquarrelsome or take offense, all of which from his characteristic good\\nnature he never did. It would have struck him as absurd if he had been\\ntold that he would not get a position with the salary he required,\\nespecially as he expected nothing out of the way; he only wanted what\\nthe men of his own age and standing did get, and he was no worse\\nqualified for performing duties of the kind than any other man.\\n\\nStepan Arkadyevitch was not merely liked by all who knew him for his\\ngood humor, but for his bright disposition, and his unquestionable\\nhonesty. In him, in his handsome, radiant figure, his sparkling eyes,\\nblack hair and eyebrows, and the white and red of his face, there was\\nsomething which produced a physical effect of kindliness and good humor\\non the people who met him. “Aha! Stiva! Oblonsky! Here he is!” was\\nalmost always said with a smile of delight on meeting him. Even though\\nit happened at times that after a conversation with him it seemed that\\nnothing particularly delightful had happened, the next day, and the\\nnext, everyone was just as delighted at meeting him again.\\n\\nAfter filling for three years the post of president of one of the\\ngovernment boards at Moscow, Stepan Arkadyevitch had won the respect,\\nas well as the liking, of his fellow-officials, subordinates, and\\nsuperiors, and all who had had business with him. The principal\\nqualities in Stepan Arkadyevitch which had gained him this universal\\nrespect in the service consisted, in the first place, of his extreme\\nindulgence for others, founded on a consciousness of his own\\nshortcomings; secondly, of his perfect liberalism—not the liberalism he\\nread of in the papers, but the liberalism that was in his blood, in\\nvirtue of which he treated all men perfectly equally and exactly the\\nsame, whatever their fortune or calling might be; and thirdly—the most\\nimportant point—his complete indifference to the business in which he\\nwas engaged, in consequence of which he was never carried away, and\\nnever made mistakes.\\n\\nOn reaching the offices of the board, Stepan Arkadyevitch, escorted by\\na deferential porter with a portfolio, went into his little private\\nroom, put on his uniform, and went into the boardroom. The clerks and\\ncopyists all rose, greeting him with good-humored deference. Stepan\\nArkadyevitch moved quickly, as ever, to his place, shook hands with his\\ncolleagues, and sat down. He made a joke or two, and talked just as\\nmuch as was consistent with due decorum, and began work. No one knew\\nbetter than Stepan Arkadyevitch how to hit on the exact line between\\nfreedom, simplicity, and official stiffness necessary for the agreeable\\nconduct of business. A secretary, with the good-humored deference\\ncommon to everyone in Stepan Arkadyevitch’s office, came up with\\npapers, and began to speak in the familiar and easy tone which had been\\nintroduced by Stepan Arkadyevitch.\\n\\n“We have succeeded in getting the information from the government\\ndepartment of Penza. Here, would you care?...”\\n\\n“You’ve got them at last?” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, laying his finger\\non the paper. “Now, gentlemen....”\\n\\nAnd the sitting of the board began.\\n\\n“If they knew,” he thought, bending his head with a significant air as\\nhe listened to the report, “what a guilty little boy their president\\nwas half an hour ago.” And his eyes were laughing during the reading of\\nthe report. Till two o’clock the sitting would go on without a break,\\nand at two o’clock there would be an interval and luncheon.\\n\\nIt was not yet two, when the large glass doors of the boardroom\\nsuddenly opened and someone came in.\\n\\nAll the officials sitting on the further side under the portrait of the\\nTsar and the eagle, delighted at any distraction, looked round at the\\ndoor; but the doorkeeper standing at the door at once drove out the\\nintruder, and closed the glass door after him.\\n\\nWhen the case had been read through, Stepan Arkadyevitch got up and\\nstretched, and by way of tribute to the liberalism of the times took\\nout a cigarette in the boardroom and went into his private room. Two of\\nthe members of the board, the old veteran in the service, Nikitin, and\\nthe _Kammerjunker_ Grinevitch, went in with him.\\n\\n“We shall have time to finish after lunch,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch.\\n\\n“To be sure we shall!” said Nikitin.\\n\\n“A pretty sharp fellow this Fomin must be,” said Grinevitch of one of\\nthe persons taking part in the case they were examining.\\n\\nStepan Arkadyevitch frowned at Grinevitch’s words, giving him thereby\\nto understand that it was improper to pass judgment prematurely, and\\nmade him no reply.\\n\\n“Who was that came in?” he asked the doorkeeper.\\n\\n“Someone, your excellency, crept in without permission directly my back\\nwas turned. He was asking for you. I told him: when the members come\\nout, then....”\\n\\n“Where is he?”\\n\\n“Maybe he’s gone into the passage, but here he comes anyway. That is\\nhe,” said the doorkeeper, pointing to a strongly built,\\nbroad-shouldered man with a curly beard, who, without taking off his\\nsheepskin cap, was running lightly and rapidly up the worn steps of the\\nstone staircase. One of the members going down—a lean official with a\\nportfolio—stood out of his way and looked disapprovingly at the legs of\\nthe stranger, then glanced inquiringly at Oblonsky.\\n\\nStepan Arkadyevitch was standing at the top of the stairs. His\\ngood-naturedly beaming face above the embroidered collar of his uniform\\nbeamed more than ever when he recognized the man coming up.\\n\\n“Why, it’s actually you, Levin, at last!” he said with a friendly\\nmocking smile, scanning Levin as he approached. “How is it you have\\ndeigned to look me up in this den?” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, and not\\ncontent with shaking hands, he kissed his friend. “Have you been here\\nlong?”\\n\\n“I have just come, and very much wanted to see you,” said Levin,\\nlooking shyly and at the same time angrily and uneasily around.\\n\\n“Well, let’s go into my room,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, who knew his\\nfriend’s sensitive and irritable shyness, and, taking his arm, he drew\\nhim along, as though guiding him through dangers.\\n\\nStepan Arkadyevitch was on familiar terms with almost all his\\nacquaintances, and called almost all of them by their Christian names:\\nold men of sixty, boys of twenty, actors, ministers, merchants, and\\nadjutant-generals, so that many of his intimate chums were to be found\\nat the extreme ends of the social ladder, and would have been very much\\nsurprised to learn that they had, through the medium of Oblonsky,\\nsomething in common. He was the familiar friend of everyone with whom\\nhe took a glass of champagne, and he took a glass of champagne with\\neveryone, and when in consequence he met any of his disreputable chums,\\nas he used in joke to call many of his friends, in the presence of his\\nsubordinates, he well knew how, with his characteristic tact, to\\ndiminish the disagreeable impression made on them. Levin was not a\\ndisreputable chum, but Oblonsky, with his ready tact, felt that Levin\\nfancied he might not care to show his intimacy with him before his\\nsubordinates, and so he made haste to take him off into his room.\\n\\nLevin was almost of the same age as Oblonsky; their intimacy did not\\nrest merely on champagne. Levin had been the friend and companion of\\nhis early youth. They were fond of one another in spite of the\\ndifference of their characters and tastes, as friends are fond of one\\nanother who have been together in early youth. But in spite of this,\\neach of them—as is often the way with men who have selected careers of\\ndifferent kinds—though in discussion he would even justify the other’s\\ncareer, in his heart despised it. It seemed to each of them that the\\nlife he led himself was the only real life, and the life led by his\\nfriend was a mere phantasm. Oblonsky could not restrain a slight\\nmocking smile at the sight of Levin. How often he had seen him come up\\nto Moscow from the country where he was doing something, but what\\nprecisely Stepan Arkadyevitch could never quite make out, and indeed he\\ntook no interest in the matter. Levin arrived in Moscow always excited\\nand in a hurry, rather ill at ease and irritated by his own want of\\nease, and for the most part with a perfectly new, unexpected view of\\nthings. Stepan Arkadyevitch laughed at this, and liked it. In the same\\nway Levin in his heart despised the town mode of life of his friend,\\nand his official duties, which he laughed at, and regarded as trifling.\\nBut the difference was that Oblonsky, as he was doing the same as\\neveryone did, laughed complacently and good-humoredly, while Levin\\nlaughed without complacency and sometimes angrily.\\n\\n“We have long been expecting you,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, going into\\nhis room and letting Levin’s hand go as though to show that here all\\ndanger was over. “I am very, very glad to see you,” he went on. “Well,\\nhow are you? Eh? When did you come?”\\n\\nLevin was silent, looking at the unknown faces of Oblonsky’s two\\ncompanions, and especially at the hand of the elegant Grinevitch, which\\nhad such long white fingers, such long yellow filbert-shaped nails, and\\nsuch huge shining studs on the shirt-cuff, that apparently they\\nabsorbed all his attention, and allowed him no freedom of thought.\\nOblonsky noticed this at once, and smiled.\\n\\n“Ah, to be sure, let me introduce you,” he said. “My colleagues: Philip\\nIvanitch Nikitin, Mihail Stanislavitch Grinevitch”—and turning to\\nLevin—“a district councilor, a modern district councilman, a gymnast\\nwho lifts thirteen stone with one hand, a cattle-breeder and sportsman,\\nand my friend, Konstantin Dmitrievitch Levin, the brother of Sergey\\nIvanovitch Koznishev.”\\n\\n“Delighted,” said the veteran.\\n\\n“I have the honor of knowing your brother, Sergey Ivanovitch,” said\\nGrinevitch, holding out his slender hand with its long nails.\\n\\nLevin frowned, shook hands coldly, and at once turned to Oblonsky.\\nThough he had a great respect for his half-brother, an author well\\nknown to all Russia, he could not endure it when people treated him not\\nas Konstantin Levin, but as the brother of the celebrated Koznishev.\\n\\n“No, I am no longer a district councilor. I have quarreled with them\\nall, and don’t go to the meetings any more,” he said, turning to\\nOblonsky.\\n\\n“You’ve been quick about it!” said Oblonsky with a smile. “But how?\\nwhy?”\\n\\n“It’s a long story. I will tell you some time,” said Levin, but he\\nbegan telling him at once. “Well, to put it shortly, I was convinced\\nthat nothing was really done by the district councils, or ever could\\nbe,” he began, as though someone had just insulted him. “On one side\\nit’s a plaything; they play at being a parliament, and I’m neither\\nyoung enough nor old enough to find amusement in playthings; and on the\\nother side” (he stammered) “it’s a means for the coterie of the\\ndistrict to make money. Formerly they had wardships, courts of justice,\\nnow they have the district council—not in the form of bribes, but in\\nthe form of unearned salary,” he said, as hotly as though someone of\\nthose present had opposed his opinion.\\n\\n“Aha! You’re in a new phase again, I see—a conservative,” said Stepan\\nArkadyevitch. “However, we can go into that later.”\\n\\n“Yes, later. But I wanted to see you,” said Levin, looking with hatred\\nat Grinevitch’s hand.\\n\\nStepan Arkadyevitch gave a scarcely perceptible smile.\\n\\n“How was it you used to say you would never wear European dress again?”\\nhe said, scanning his new suit, obviously cut by a French tailor. “Ah!\\nI see: a new phase.”\\n\\nLevin suddenly blushed, not as grown men blush, slightly, without being\\nthemselves aware of it, but as boys blush, feeling that they are\\nridiculous through their shyness, and consequently ashamed of it and\\nblushing still more, almost to the point of tears. And it was so\\nstrange to see this sensible, manly face in such a childish plight,\\nthat Oblonsky left off looking at him.\\n\\n“Oh, where shall we meet? You know I want very much to talk to you,”\\nsaid Levin.\\n\\nOblonsky seemed to ponder.\\n\\n“I’ll tell you what: let’s go to Gurin’s to lunch, and there we can\\ntalk. I am free till three.”\\n\\n“No,” answered Levin, after an instant’s thought, “I have got to go on\\nsomewhere else.”\\n\\n“All right, then, let’s dine together.”\\n\\n“Dine together? But I have nothing very particular, only a few words to\\nsay, and a question I want to ask you, and we can have a talk\\nafterwards.”\\n\\n“Well, say the few words, then, at once, and we’ll gossip after\\ndinner.”\\n\\n“Well, it’s this,” said Levin; “but it’s of no importance, though.”\\n\\nHis face all at once took an expression of anger from the effort he was\\nmaking to surmount his shyness.\\n\\n“What are the Shtcherbatskys doing? Everything as it used to be?” he\\nsaid.\\n\\nStepan Arkadyevitch, who had long known that Levin was in love with his\\nsister-in-law, Kitty, gave a hardly perceptible smile, and his eyes\\nsparkled merrily.\\n\\n“You said a few words, but I can’t answer in a few words, because....\\nExcuse me a minute....”\\n\\nA secretary came in, with respectful familiarity and the modest\\nconsciousness, characteristic of every secretary, of superiority to his\\nchief in the knowledge of their business; he went up to Oblonsky with\\nsome papers, and began, under pretense of asking a question, to explain\\nsome objection. Stepan Arkadyevitch, without hearing him out, laid his\\nhand genially on the secretary’s sleeve.\\n\\n“No, you do as I told you,” he said, softening his words with a smile,\\nand with a brief explanation of his view of the matter he turned away\\nfrom the papers, and said: “So do it that way, if you please, Zahar\\nNikititch.”\\n\\nThe secretary retired in confusion. During the consultation with the\\nsecretary Levin had completely recovered from his embarrassment. He was\\nstanding with his elbows on the back of a chair, and on his face was a\\nlook of ironical attention.\\n\\n“I don’t understand it, I don’t understand it,” he said.\\n\\n“What don’t you understand?” said Oblonsky, smiling as brightly as\\never, and picking up a cigarette. He expected some queer outburst from\\nLevin.\\n\\n“I don’t understand what you are doing,” said Levin, shrugging his\\nshoulders. “How can you do it seriously?”\\n\\n“Why not?”\\n\\n“Why, because there’s nothing in it.”\\n\\n“You think so, but we’re overwhelmed with work.”\\n\\n“On paper. But, there, you’ve a gift for it,” added Levin.\\n\\n“That’s to say, you think there’s a lack of something in me?”\\n\\n“Perhaps so,” said Levin. “But all the same I admire your grandeur, and\\nam proud that I’ve a friend in such a great person. You’ve not answered\\nmy question, though,” he went on, with a desperate effort looking\\nOblonsky straight in the face.\\n\\n“Oh, that’s all very well. You wait a bit, and you’ll come to this\\nyourself. It’s very nice for you to have over six thousand acres in the\\nKarazinsky district, and such muscles, and the freshness of a girl of\\ntwelve; still you’ll be one of us one day. Yes, as to your question,\\nthere is no change, but it’s a pity you’ve been away so long.”\\n\\n“Oh, why so?” Levin queried, panic-stricken.\\n\\n“Oh, nothing,” responded Oblonsky. “We’ll talk it over. But what’s\\nbrought you up to town?”\\n\\n“Oh, we’ll talk about that, too, later on,” said Levin, reddening again\\nup to his ears.\\n\\n“All right. I see,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch. “I should ask you to come\\nto us, you know, but my wife’s not quite the thing. But I tell you\\nwhat; if you want to see them, they’re sure now to be at the Zoological\\nGardens from four to five. Kitty skates. You drive along there, and\\nI’ll come and fetch you, and we’ll go and dine somewhere together.”\\n\\n“Capital. So good-bye till then.”\\n\\n“Now mind, you’ll forget, I know you, or rush off home to the country!”\\nStepan Arkadyevitch called out laughing.\\n\\n“No, truly!”\\n\\nAnd Levin went out of the room, only when he was in the doorway\\nremembering that he had forgotten to take leave of Oblonsky’s\\ncolleagues.\\n\\n“That gentleman must be a man of great energy,” said Grinevitch, when\\nLevin had gone away.\\n\\n“Yes, my dear boy,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, nodding his head, “he’s a\\nlucky fellow! Over six thousand acres in the Karazinsky district;\\neverything before him; and what youth and vigor! Not like some of us.”\\n\\n“You have a great deal to complain of, haven’t you, Stepan\\nArkadyevitch?”\\n\\n“Ah, yes, I’m in a poor way, a bad way,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch with\\na heavy sigh 6\\n\\nWhen Oblonsky asked Levin what had brought him to town, Levin blushed,\\nand was furious with himself for blushing, because he could not answer,\\n“I have come to make your sister-in-law an offer,” though that was\\nprecisely what he had come for.\\n\\nThe families of the Levins and the Shtcherbatskys were old, noble\\nMoscow families, and had always been on intimate and friendly terms.\\nThis intimacy had grown still closer during Levin’s student days. He\\nhad both prepared for the university with the young Prince\\nShtcherbatsky, the brother of Kitty and Dolly, and had entered at the\\nsame time with him. In those days Levin used often to be in the\\nShtcherbatskys’ house, and he was in love with the Shtcherbatsky\\nhousehold. Strange as it may appear, it was with the household, the\\nfamily, that Konstantin Levin was in love, especially with the feminine\\nhalf of the household. Levin did not remember his own mother, and his\\nonly sister was older than he was, so that it was in the\\nShtcherbatskys’ house that he saw for the first time that inner life of\\nan old, noble, cultivated, and honorable family of which he had been\\ndeprived by the death of his father and mother. All the members of that\\nfamily, especially the feminine half, were pictured by him, as it were,\\nwrapped about with a mysterious poetical veil, and he not only\\nperceived no defects whatever in them, but under the poetical veil that\\nshrouded them he assumed the existence of the loftiest sentiments and\\nevery possible perfection. Why it was the three young ladies had one\\nday to speak French, and the next English; why it was that at certain\\nhours they played by turns on the piano, the sounds of which were\\naudible in their brother’s room above, where the students used to work;\\nwhy they were visited by those professors of French literature, of\\nmusic, of drawing, of dancing; why at certain hours all the three young\\nladies, with Mademoiselle Linon, drove in the coach to the Tversky\\nboulevard, dressed in their satin cloaks, Dolly in a long one, Natalia\\nin a half-long one, and Kitty in one so short that her shapely legs in\\ntightly-drawn red stockings were visible to all beholders; why it was\\nthey had to walk about the Tversky boulevard escorted by a footman with\\na gold cockade in his hat—all this and much more that was done in their\\nmysterious world he did not understand, but he was sure that everything\\nthat was done there was very good, and he was in love precisely with\\nthe mystery of the proceedings.\\n\\nIn his student days he had all but been in love with the eldest, Dolly,\\nbut she was soon married to Oblonsky. Then he began being in love with\\nthe second. He felt, as it were, that he had to be in love with one of\\nthe sisters, only he could not quite make out which. But Natalia, too,\\nhad hardly made her appearance in the world when she married the\\ndiplomat Lvov. Kitty was still a child when Levin left the university.\\nYoung Shtcherbatsky went into the navy, was drowned in the Baltic, and\\nLevin’s relations with the Shtcherbatskys, in spite of his friendship\\nwith Oblonsky, became less intimate. But when early in the winter of\\nthis year Levin came to Moscow, after a year in the country, and saw\\nthe Shtcherbatskys, he realized which of the three sisters he was\\nindeed destined to love.\\n\\nOne would have thought that nothing could be simpler than for him, a\\nman of good family, rather rich than poor, and thirty-two years old, to\\nmake the young Princess Shtcherbatskaya an offer of marriage; in all\\nlikelihood he would at once have been looked upon as a good match. But\\nLevin was in love, and so it seemed to him that Kitty was so perfect in\\nevery respect that she was a creature far above everything earthly; and\\nthat he was a creature so low and so earthly that it could not even be\\nconceived that other people and she herself could regard him as worthy\\nof her.\\n\\nAfter spending two months in Moscow in a state of enchantment, seeing\\nKitty almost every day in society, into which he went so as to meet\\nher, he abruptly decided that it could not be, and went back to the\\ncountry.\\n\\nLevin’s conviction that it could not be was founded on the idea that in\\nthe eyes of her family he was a disadvantageous and worthless match for\\nthe charming Kitty, and that Kitty herself could not love him. In her\\nfamily’s eyes he had no ordinary, definite career and position in\\nsociety, while his contemporaries by this time, when he was thirty-two,\\nwere already, one a colonel, and another a professor, another director\\nof a bank and railways, or president of a board like Oblonsky. But he\\n(he knew very well how he must appear to others) was a country\\ngentleman, occupied in breeding cattle, shooting game, and building\\nbarns; in other words, a fellow of no ability, who had not turned out\\nwell, and who was doing just what, according to the ideas of the world,\\nis done by people fit for nothing else.\\n\\nThe mysterious, enchanting Kitty herself could not love such an ugly\\nperson as he conceived himself to be, and, above all, such an ordinary,\\nin no way striking person. Moreover, his attitude to Kitty in the\\npast—the attitude of a grown-up person to a child, arising from his\\nfriendship with her brother—seemed to him yet another obstacle to love.\\nAn ugly, good-natured man, as he considered himself, might, he\\nsupposed, be liked as a friend; but to be loved with such a love as\\nthat with which he loved Kitty, one would need to be a handsome and,\\nstill more, a distinguished man.\\n\\nHe had heard that women often did care for ugly and ordinary men, but\\nhe did not believe it, for he judged by himself, and he could not\\nhimself have loved any but beautiful, mysterious, and exceptional\\nwomen.\\n\\nBut after spending two months alone in the country, he was convinced\\nthat this was not one of those passions of which he had had experience\\nin his early youth; that this feeling gave him not an instant’s rest;\\nthat he could not live without deciding the question, would she or\\nwould she not be his wife, and that his despair had arisen only from\\nhis own imaginings, that he had no sort of proof that he would be\\nrejected. And he had now come to Moscow with a firm determination to\\nmake an offer, and get married if he were accepted. Or ... he could not\\nconceive what would become of him if he were rejected 7\\n\\nOn arriving in Moscow by a morning train, Levin had put up at the house\\nof his elder half-brother, Koznishev. After changing his clothes he\\nwent down to his brother’s study, intending to talk to him at once\\nabout the object of his visit, and to ask his advice; but his brother\\nwas not alone. With him there was a well-known professor of philosophy,\\nwho had come from Harkov expressly to clear up a difference that had\\narisen between them on a very important philosophical question. The\\nprofessor was carrying on a hot crusade against materialists. Sergey\\nKoznishev had been following this crusade with interest, and after\\nreading the professor’s last article, he had written him a letter\\nstating his objections. He accused the professor of making too great\\nconcessions to the materialists. And the professor had promptly\\nappeared to argue the matter out. The point in discussion was the\\nquestion then in vogue: Is there a line to be drawn between\\npsychological and physiological phenomena in man? and if so, where?\\n\\nSergey Ivanovitch met his brother with the smile of chilly friendliness\\nhe always had for everyone, and introducing him to the professor, went\\non with the conversation.\\n\\nA little man in spectacles, with a narrow forehead, tore himself from\\nthe discussion for an instant to greet Levin, and then went on talking\\nwithout paying any further attention to him. Levin sat down to wait\\ntill the professor should go, but he soon began to get interested in\\nthe subject under discussion.\\n\\nLevin had come across the magazine articles about which they were\\ndisputing, and had read them, interested in them as a development of\\nthe first principles of science, familiar to him as a natural science\\nstudent at the university. But he had never connected these scientific\\ndeductions as to the origin of man as an animal, as to reflex action,\\nbiology, and sociology, with those questions as to the meaning of life\\nand death to himself, which had of late been more and more often in his\\nmind.\\n\\nAs he listened to his brother’s argument with the professor, he noticed\\nthat they connected these scientific questions with those spiritual\\nproblems, that at times they almost touched on the latter; but every\\ntime they were close upon what seemed to him the chief point, they\\npromptly beat a hasty retreat, and plunged again into a sea of subtle\\ndistinctions, reservations, quotations, allusions, and appeals to\\nauthorities, and it was with difficulty that he understood what they\\nwere talking about.\\n\\n“I cannot admit it,” said Sergey Ivanovitch, with his habitual\\nclearness, precision of expression, and elegance of phrase. “I cannot\\nin any case agree with Keiss that my whole conception of the external\\nworld has been derived from perceptions. The most fundamental idea, the\\nidea of existence, has not been received by me through sensation;\\nindeed, there is no special sense-organ for the transmission of such an\\nidea.”\\n\\n“Yes, but they—Wurt, and Knaust, and Pripasov—would answer that your\\nconsciousness of existence is derived from the conjunction of all your\\nsensations, that that consciousness of existence is the result of your\\nsensations. Wurt, indeed, says plainly that, assuming there are no\\nsensations, it follows that there is no idea of existence.”\\n\\n“I maintain the contrary,” began Sergey Ivanovitch.\\n\\nBut here it seemed to Levin that just as they were close upon the real\\npoint of the matter, they were again retreating, and he made up his\\nmind to put a question to the professor.\\n\\n“According to that, if my senses are annihilated, if my body is dead, I\\ncan have no existence of any sort?” he queried.\\n\\nThe professor, in annoyance, and, as it were, mental suffering at the\\ninterruption, looked round at the strange inquirer, more like a\\nbargeman than a philosopher, and turned his eyes upon Sergey\\nIvanovitch, as though to ask: What’s one to say to him? But Sergey\\nIvanovitch, who had been talking with far less heat and one-sidedness\\nthan the professor, and who had sufficient breadth of mind to answer\\nthe professor, and at the same time to comprehend the simple and\\nnatural point of view from which the question was put, smiled and said:\\n\\n“That question we have no right to answer as yet.”\\n\\n“We have not the requisite data,” chimed in the professor, and he went\\nback to his argument. “No,” he said; “I would point out the fact that\\nif, as Pripasov directly asserts, perception is based on sensation,\\nthen we are bound to distinguish sharply between these two\\nconceptions.”\\n\\nLevin listened no more, and simply waited for the professor to go 8\\n\\nWhen the professor had gone, Sergey Ivanovitch turned to his brother.\\n\\n“Delighted that you’ve come. For some time, is it? How’s your farming\\ngetting on?”\\n\\nLevin knew that his elder brother took little interest in farming, and\\nonly put the question in deference to him, and so he only told him\\nabout the sale of his wheat and money matters.\\n\\nLevin had meant to tell his brother of his determination to get\\nmarried, and to ask his advice; he had indeed firmly resolved to do so.\\nBut after seeing his brother, listening to his conversation with the\\nprofessor, hearing afterwards the unconsciously patronizing tone in\\nwhich his brother questioned him about agricultural matters (their\\nmother’s property had not been divided, and Levin took charge of both\\ntheir shares), Levin felt that he could not for some reason begin to\\ntalk to him of his intention of marrying. He felt that his brother\\nwould not look at it as he would have wished him to.\\n\\n“Well, how is your district council doing?” asked Sergey Ivanovitch,\\nwho was greatly interested in these local boards and attached great\\nimportance to them.\\n\\n“I really don’t know.”\\n\\n“What! Why, surely you’re a member of the board?”\\n\\n“No, I’m not a member now; I’ve resigned,” answered Levin, “and I no\\nlonger attend the meetings.”\\n\\n“What a pity!” commented Sergey Ivanovitch, frowning.\\n\\nLevin in self-defense began to describe what took place in the meetings\\nin his district.\\n\\n“That’s how it always is!” Sergey Ivanovitch interrupted him. “We\\nRussians are always like that. Perhaps it’s our strong point, really,\\nthe faculty of seeing our own shortcomings; but we overdo it, we\\ncomfort ourselves with irony which we always have on the tip of our\\ntongues. All I say is, give such rights as our local self-government to\\nany other European people—why, the Germans or the English would have\\nworked their way to freedom from them, while we simply turn them into\\nridicule.”\\n\\n“But how can it be helped?” said Levin penitently. “It was my last\\neffort. And I did try with all my soul. I can’t. I’m no good at it.”\\n\\n“It’s not that you’re no good at it,” said Sergey Ivanovitch; “it is\\nthat you don’t look at it as you should.”\\n\\n“Perhaps not,” Levin answered dejectedly.\\n\\n“Oh! do you know brother Nikolay’s turned up again?”\\n\\nThis brother Nikolay was the elder brother of Konstantin Levin, and\\nhalf-brother of Sergey Ivanovitch; a man utterly ruined, who had\\ndissipated the greater part of his fortune, was living in the strangest\\nand lowest company, and had quarreled with his brothers.\\n\\n“What did you say?” Levin cried with horror. “How do you know?”\\n\\n“Prokofy saw him in the street.”\\n\\n“Here in Moscow? Where is he? Do you know?” Levin got up from his\\nchair, as though on the point of starting off at once.\\n\\n“I am sorry I told you,” said Sergey Ivanovitch, shaking his head at\\nhis younger brother’s excitement. “I sent to find out where he is\\nliving, and sent him his IOU to Trubin, which I paid. This is the\\nanswer he sent me.”\\n\\nAnd Sergey Ivanovitch took a note from under a paper-weight and handed\\nit to his brother.\\n\\nLevin read in the queer, familiar handwriting: “I humbly beg you to\\nleave me in peace. That’s the only favor I ask of my gracious\\nbrothers.—Nikolay Levin.”\\n\\nLevin read it, and without raising his head stood with the note in his\\nhands opposite Sergey Ivanovitch.\\n\\nThere was a struggle in his heart between the desire to forget his\\nunhappy brother for the time, and the consciousness that it would be\\nbase to do so.\\n\\n“He obviously wants to offend me,” pursued Sergey Ivanovitch; “but he\\ncannot offend me, and I should have wished with all my heart to assist\\nhim, but I know it’s impossible to do that.”\\n\\n“Yes, yes,” repeated Levin. “I understand and appreciate your attitude\\nto him; but I shall go and see him.”\\n\\n“If you want to, do; but I shouldn’t advise it,” said Sergey\\nIvanovitch. “As regards myself, I have no fear of your doing so; he\\nwill not make you quarrel with me; but for your own sake, I should say\\nyou would do better not to go. You can’t do him any good; still, do as\\nyou please.”\\n\\n“Very likely I can’t do any good, but I feel—especially at such a\\nmoment—but that’s another thing—I feel I could not be at peace.”\\n\\n“Well, that I don’t understand,” said Sergey Ivanovitch. “One thing I\\ndo understand,” he added; “it’s a lesson in humility. I have come to\\nlook very differently and more charitably on what is called infamous\\nsince brother Nikolay has become what he is ... you know what he\\ndid....”\\n\\n“Oh, it’s awful, awful!” repeated Levin.\\n\\nAfter obtaining his brother’s address from Sergey Ivanovitch’s footman,\\nLevin was on the point of setting off at once to see him, but on second\\nthought he decided to put off his visit till the evening. The first\\nthing to do to set his heart at rest was to accomplish what he had come\\nto Moscow for. From his brother’s Levin went to Oblonsky’s office, and\\non getting news of the Shtcherbatskys from him, he drove to the place\\nwhere he had been told he might find Kitty 9\\n\\nAt four o’clock, conscious of his throbbing heart, Levin stepped out of\\na hired sledge at the Zoological Gardens, and turned along the path to\\nthe frozen mounds and the skating ground, knowing that he would\\ncertainly find her there, as he had seen the Shtcherbatskys’ carriage\\nat the entrance.\\n\\nIt was a bright, frosty day. Rows of carriages, sledges, drivers, and\\npolicemen were standing in the approach. Crowds of well-dressed people,\\nwith hats bright in the sun, swarmed about the entrance and along the\\nwell-swept little paths between the little houses adorned with carving\\nin the Russian style. The old curly birches of the gardens, all their\\ntwigs laden with snow, looked as though freshly decked in sacred\\nvestments.\\n\\nHe walked along the path towards the skating-ground, and kept saying to\\nhimself—“You mustn’t be excited, you must be calm. What’s the matter\\nwith you? What do you want? Be quiet, stupid,” he conjured his heart.\\nAnd the more he tried to compose himself, the more breathless he found\\nhimself. An acquaintance met him and called him by his name, but Levin\\ndid not even recognize him. He went towards the mounds, whence came the\\nclank of the chains of sledges as they slipped down or were dragged up,\\nthe rumble of the sliding sledges, and the sounds of merry voices. He\\nwalked on a few steps, and the skating-ground lay open before his eyes,\\nand at once, amidst all the skaters, he knew her.\\n\\nHe knew she was there by the rapture and the terror that seized on his\\nheart. She was standing talking to a lady at the opposite end of the\\nground. There was apparently nothing striking either in her dress or\\nher attitude. But for Levin she was as easy to find in that crowd as a\\nrose among nettles. Everything was made bright by her. She was the\\nsmile that shed light on all round her. “Is it possible I can go over\\nthere on the ice, go up to her?” he thought. The place where she stood\\nseemed to him a holy shrine, unapproachable, and there was one moment\\nwhen he was almost retreating, so overwhelmed was he with terror. He\\nhad to make an effort to master himself, and to remind himself that\\npeople of all sorts were moving about her, and that he too might come\\nthere to skate. He walked down, for a long while avoiding looking at\\nher as at the sun, but seeing her, as one does the sun, without\\nlooking.\\n\\nOn that day of the week and at that time of day people of one set, all\\nacquainted with one another, used to meet on the ice. There were crack\\nskaters there, showing off their skill, and learners clinging to chairs\\nwith timid, awkward movements, boys, and elderly people skating with\\nhygienic motives. They seemed to Levin an elect band of blissful beings\\nbecause they were here, near her. All the skaters, it seemed, with\\nperfect self-possession, skated towards her, skated by her, even spoke\\nto her, and were happy, quite apart from her, enjoying the capital ice\\nand the fine weather.\\n\\nNikolay Shtcherbatsky, Kitty’s cousin, in a short jacket and tight\\ntrousers, was sitting on a garden seat with his skates on. Seeing\\nLevin, he shouted to him:\\n\\n“Ah, the first skater in Russia! Been here long? First-rate ice—do put\\nyour skates on.”\\n\\n“I haven’t got my skates,” Levin answered, marveling at this boldness\\nand ease in her presence, and not for one second losing sight of her,\\nthough he did not look at her. He felt as though the sun were coming\\nnear him. She was in a corner, and turning out her slender feet in\\ntheir high boots with obvious timidity, she skated towards him. A boy\\nin Russian dress, desperately waving his arms and bowed down to the\\nground, overtook her. She skated a little uncertainly; taking her hands\\nout of the little muff that hung on a cord, she held them ready for\\nemergency, and looking towards Levin, whom she had recognized, she\\nsmiled at him, and at her own fears. When she had got round the turn,\\nshe gave herself a push off with one foot, and skated straight up to\\nShtcherbatsky. Clutching at his arm, she nodded smiling to Levin. She\\nwas more splendid than he had imagined her.\\n\\nWhen he thought of her, he could call up a vivid picture of her to\\nhimself, especially the charm of that little fair head, so freely set\\non the shapely girlish shoulders, and so full of childish brightness\\nand good humor. The childishness of her expression, together with the\\ndelicate beauty of her figure, made up her special charm, and that he\\nfully realized. But what always struck him in her as something unlooked\\nfor, was the expression of her eyes, soft, serene, and truthful, and\\nabove all, her smile, which always transported Levin to an enchanted\\nworld, where he felt himself softened and tender, as he remembered\\nhimself in some days of his early childhood.\\n\\n“Have you been here long?” she said, giving him her hand. “Thank you,”\\nshe added, as he picked up the handkerchief that had fallen out of her\\nmuff.\\n\\n“I? I’ve not long ... yesterday ... I mean today ... I arrived,”\\nanswered Levin, in his emotion not at once understanding her question.\\n“I was meaning to come and see you,” he said; and then, recollecting\\nwith what intention he was trying to see her, he was promptly overcome\\nwith confusion and blushed.\\n\\n“I didn’t know you could skate, and skate so well.”\\n\\nShe looked at him earnestly, as though wishing to make out the cause of\\nhis confusion.\\n\\n“Your praise is worth having. The tradition is kept up here that you\\nare the best of skaters,” she said, with her little black-gloved hand\\nbrushing a grain of hoarfrost off her muff.\\n\\n“Yes, I used once to skate with passion; I wanted to reach perfection.”\\n\\n“You do everything with passion, I think,” she said smiling. “I should\\nso like to see how you skate. Put on skates, and let us skate\\ntogether.”\\n\\n“Skate together! Can that be possible?” thought Levin, gazing at her.\\n\\n“I’ll put them on directly,” he said.\\n\\nAnd he went off to get skates.\\n\\n“It’s a long while since we’ve seen you here, sir,” said the attendant,\\nsupporting his foot, and screwing on the heel of the skate. “Except\\nyou, there’s none of the gentlemen first-rate skaters. Will that be all\\nright?” said he, tightening the strap.\\n\\n“Oh, yes, yes; make haste, please,” answered Levin, with difficulty\\nrestraining the smile of rapture which would overspread his face.\\n“Yes,” he thought, “this now is life, this is happiness! _Together,_\\nshe said; _let us skate together!_ Speak to her now? But that’s just\\nwhy I’m afraid to speak—because I’m happy now, happy in hope,\\nanyway.... And then?... But I must! I must! I must! Away with\\nweakness!”\\n\\nLevin rose to his feet, took off his overcoat, and scurrying over the\\nrough ice round the hut, came out on the smooth ice and skated without\\neffort, as it were, by simple exercise of will, increasing and\\nslackening speed and turning his course. He approached with timidity,\\nbut again her smile reassured him.\\n\\nShe gave him her hand, and they set off side by side, going faster and\\nfaster, and the more rapidly they moved the more tightly she grasped\\nhis hand.\\n\\n“With you I should soon learn; I somehow feel confidence in you,” she\\nsaid to him.\\n\\n“And I have confidence in myself when you are leaning on me,” he said,\\nbut was at once panic-stricken at what he had said, and blushed. And\\nindeed, no sooner had he uttered these words, when all at once, like\\nthe sun going behind a cloud, her face lost all its friendliness, and\\nLevin detected the familiar change in her expression that denoted the\\nworking of thought; a crease showed on her smooth brow.\\n\\n“Is there anything troubling you?—though I’ve no right to ask such a\\nquestion,” he added hurriedly.\\n\\n“Oh, why so?... No, I have nothing to trouble me,” she responded\\ncoldly; and she added immediately: “You haven’t seen Mlle. Linon, have\\nyou?”\\n\\n“Not yet.”\\n\\n“Go and speak to her, she likes you so much.”\\n\\n“What’s wrong? I have offended her. Lord help me!” thought Levin, and\\nhe flew towards the old Frenchwoman with the gray ringlets, who was\\nsitting on a bench. Smiling and showing her false teeth, she greeted\\nhim as an old friend.\\n\\n“Yes, you see we’re growing up,” she said to him, glancing towards\\nKitty, “and growing old. _Tiny bear_ has grown big now!” pursued the\\nFrenchwoman, laughing, and she reminded him of his joke about the three\\nyoung ladies whom he had compared to the three bears in the English\\nnursery tale. “Do you remember that’s what you used to call them?”\\n\\nHe remembered absolutely nothing, but she had been laughing at the joke\\nfor ten years now, and was fond of it.\\n\\n“Now, go and skate, go and skate. Our Kitty has learned to skate\\nnicely, hasn’t she?”\\n\\nWhen Levin darted up to Kitty her face was no longer stern; her eyes\\nlooked at him with the same sincerity and friendliness, but Levin\\nfancied that in her friendliness there was a certain note of deliberate\\ncomposure. And he felt depressed. After talking a little of her old\\ngoverness and her peculiarities, she questioned him about his life.\\n\\n“Surely you must be dull in the country in the winter, aren’t you?” she\\nsaid.\\n\\n“No, I’m not dull, I am very busy,” he said, feeling that she was\\nholding him in check by her composed tone, which he would not have the\\nforce to break through, just as it had been at the beginning of the\\nwinter.\\n\\n“Are you going to stay in town long?” Kitty questioned him.\\n\\n“I don’t know,” he answered, not thinking of what he was saying. The\\nthought that if he were held in check by her tone of quiet friendliness\\nhe would end by going back again without deciding anything came into\\nhis mind, and he resolved to make a struggle against it.\\n\\n“How is it you don’t know?”\\n\\n“I don’t know. It depends upon you,” he said, and was immediately\\nhorror-stricken at his own words.\\n\\nWhether it was that she had heard his words, or that she did not want\\nto hear them, she made a sort of stumble, twice struck out, and\\nhurriedly skated away from him. She skated up to Mlle. Linon, said\\nsomething to her, and went towards the pavilion where the ladies took\\noff their skates.\\n\\n“My God! what have I done! Merciful God! help me, guide me,” said\\nLevin, praying inwardly, and at the same time, feeling a need of\\nviolent exercise, he skated about describing inner and outer circles.\\n\\nAt that moment one of the young men, the best of the skaters of the\\nday, came out of the coffee-house in his skates, with a cigarette in\\nhis mouth. Taking a run, he dashed down the steps in his skates,\\ncrashing and bounding up and down. He flew down, and without even\\nchanging the position of his hands, skated away over the ice.\\n\\n“Ah, that’s a new trick!” said Levin, and he promptly ran up to the top\\nto do this new trick.\\n\\n“Don’t break your neck! it needs practice!” Nikolay Shtcherbatsky\\nshouted after him.\\n\\nLevin went to the steps, took a run from above as best he could, and\\ndashed down, preserving his balance in this unwonted movement with his\\nhands. On the last step he stumbled, but barely touching the ice with\\nhis hand, with a violent effort recovered himself, and skated off,\\nlaughing.\\n\\n“How splendid, how nice he is!” Kitty was thinking at that time, as she\\ncame out of the pavilion with Mlle. Linon, and looked towards him with\\na smile of quiet affection, as though he were a favorite brother. “And\\ncan it be my fault, can I have done anything wrong? They talk of\\nflirtation. I know it’s not he that I love; but still I am happy with\\nhim, and he’s so jolly. Only, why did he say that?...” she mused.\\n\\nCatching sight of Kitty going away, and her mother meeting her at the\\nsteps, Levin, flushed from his rapid exercise, stood still and pondered\\na minute. He took off his skates, and overtook the mother and daughter\\nat the entrance of the gardens.\\n\\n“Delighted to see you,” said Princess Shtcherbatskaya. “On Thursdays we\\nare home, as always.”\\n\\n“Today, then?”\\n\\n“We shall be pleased to see you,” the princess said stiffly.\\n\\nThis stiffness hurt Kitty, and she could not resist the desire to\\nsmooth over her mother’s coldness. She turned her head, and with a\\nsmile said:\\n\\n“Good-bye till this evening.”\\n\\nAt that moment Stepan Arkadyevitch, his hat cocked on one side, with\\nbeaming face and eyes, strode into the garden like a conquering hero.\\nBut as he approached his mother-in-law, he responded in a mournful and\\ncrestfallen tone to her inquiries about Dolly’s health. After a little\\nsubdued and dejected conversation with his mother-in-law, he threw out\\nhis chest again, and put his arm in Levin’s.\\n\\n“Well, shall we set off?” he asked. “I’ve been thinking about you all\\nthis time, and I’m very, very glad you’ve come,” he said, looking him\\nin the face with a significant air.\\n\\n“Yes, come along,” answered Levin in ecstasy, hearing unceasingly the\\nsound of that voice saying, “Good-bye till this evening,” and seeing\\nthe smile with which it was said.\\n\\n“To the England or the Hermitage?”\\n\\n“I don’t mind which.”\\n\\n“All right, then, the England,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, selecting\\nthat restaurant because he owed more there than at the Hermitage, and\\nconsequently considered it mean to avoid it. “Have you got a sledge?\\nThat’s first-rate, for I sent my carriage home.”\\n\\nThe friends hardly spoke all the way. Levin was wondering what that\\nchange in Kitty’s expression had meant, and alternately assuring\\nhimself that there was hope, and falling into despair, seeing clearly\\nthat his hopes were insane, and yet all the while he felt himself quite\\nanother man, utterly unlike what he had been before her smile and those\\nwords, “Good-bye till this evening.”\\n\\nStepan Arkadyevitch was absorbed during the drive in composing the menu\\nof the dinner.\\n\\n“You like turbot, don’t you?” he said to Levin as they were arriving.\\n\\n“Eh?” responded Levin. “Turbot? Yes, I’m _awfully_ fond of turbot 10\\n\\nWhen Levin went into the restaurant with Oblonsky, he could not help\\nnoticing a certain peculiarity of expression, as it were, a restrained\\nradiance, about the face and whole figure of Stepan Arkadyevitch.\\nOblonsky took off his overcoat, and with his hat over one ear walked\\ninto the dining-room, giving directions to the Tatar waiters, who were\\nclustered about him in evening coats, bearing napkins. Bowing to right\\nand left to the people he met, and here as everywhere joyously greeting\\nacquaintances, he went up to the sideboard for a preliminary appetizer\\nof fish and vodka, and said to the painted Frenchwoman decked in\\nribbons, lace, and ringlets, behind the counter, something so amusing\\nthat even that Frenchwoman was moved to genuine laughter. Levin for his\\npart refrained from taking any vodka simply because he felt such a\\nloathing of that Frenchwoman, all made up, it seemed, of false hair,\\n_poudre de riz,_ and _vinaigre de toilette_. He made haste to move away\\nfrom her, as from a dirty place. His whole soul was filled with\\nmemories of Kitty, and there was a smile of triumph and happiness\\nshining in his eyes.\\n\\n“This way, your excellency, please. Your excellency won’t be disturbed\\nhere,” said a particularly pertinacious, white-headed old Tatar with\\nimmense hips and coat-tails gaping widely behind. “Walk in, your\\nexcellency,” he said to Levin; by way of showing his respect to Stepan\\nArkadyevitch, being attentive to his guest as well.\\n\\nInstantly flinging a fresh cloth over the round table under the bronze\\nchandelier, though it already had a table cloth on it, he pushed up\\nvelvet chairs, and came to a standstill before Stepan Arkadyevitch with\\na napkin and a bill of fare in his hands, awaiting his commands.\\n\\n“If you prefer it, your excellency, a private room will be free\\ndirectly; Prince Golistin with a lady. Fresh oysters have come in.”\\n\\n“Ah! oysters.”\\n\\nStepan Arkadyevitch became thoughtful.\\n\\n“How if we were to change our program, Levin?” he said, keeping his\\nfinger on the bill of fare. And his face expressed serious hesitation.\\n“Are the oysters good? Mind now.”\\n\\n“They’re Flensburg, your excellency. We’ve no Ostend.”\\n\\n“Flensburg will do, but are they fresh?”\\n\\n“Only arrived yesterday.”\\n\\n“Well, then, how if we were to begin with oysters, and so change the\\nwhole program? Eh?”\\n\\n“It’s all the same to me. I should like cabbage soup and porridge\\nbetter than anything; but of course there’s nothing like that here.”\\n\\n“_Porridge à la Russe,_ your honor would like?” said the Tatar, bending\\ndown to Levin, like a nurse speaking to a child.\\n\\n“No, joking apart, whatever you choose is sure to be good. I’ve been\\nskating, and I’m hungry. And don’t imagine,” he added, detecting a look\\nof dissatisfaction on Oblonsky’s face, “that I shan’t appreciate your\\nchoice. I am fond of good things.”\\n\\n“I should hope so! After all, it’s one of the pleasures of life,” said\\nStepan Arkadyevitch. “Well, then, my friend, you give us two—or better\\nsay three—dozen oysters, clear soup with vegetables....”\\n\\n“_Printanière,_” prompted the Tatar. But Stepan Arkadyevitch apparently\\ndid not care to allow him the satisfaction of giving the French names\\nof the dishes.\\n\\n“With vegetables in it, you know. Then turbot with thick sauce, then\\n... roast beef; and mind it’s good. Yes, and capons, perhaps, and then\\nsweets.”\\n\\nThe Tatar, recollecting that it was Stepan Arkadyevitch’s way not to\\ncall the dishes by the names in the French bill of fare, did not repeat\\nthem after him, but could not resist rehearsing the whole menu to\\nhimself according to the bill:—“_Soupe printanière, turbot, sauce\\nBeaumarchais, poulard à l’estragon, macédoine de fruits_ ... etc.,” and\\nthen instantly, as though worked by springs, laying down one bound bill\\nof fare, he took up another, the list of wines, and submitted it to\\nStepan Arkadyevitch.\\n\\n“What shall we drink?”\\n\\n“What you like, only not too much. Champagne,” said Levin.\\n\\n“What! to start with? You’re right though, I dare say. Do you like the\\nwhite seal?”\\n\\n“_Cachet blanc,_” prompted the Tatar.\\n\\n“Very well, then, give us that brand with the oysters, and then we’ll\\nsee.”\\n\\n“Yes, sir. And what table wine?”\\n\\n“You can give us Nuits. Oh, no, better the classic Chablis.”\\n\\n“Yes, sir. And _your_ cheese, your excellency?”\\n\\n“Oh, yes, Parmesan. Or would you like another?”\\n\\n“No, it’s all the same to me,” said Levin, unable to suppress a smile.\\n\\nAnd the Tatar ran off with flying coat-tails, and in five minutes\\ndarted in with a dish of opened oysters on mother-of-pearl shells, and\\na bottle between his fingers.\\n\\nStepan Arkadyevitch crushed the starchy napkin, tucked it into his\\nwaistcoat, and settling his arms comfortably, started on the oysters.\\n\\n“Not bad,” he said, stripping the oysters from the pearly shell with a\\nsilver fork, and swallowing them one after another. “Not bad,” he\\nrepeated, turning his dewy, brilliant eyes from Levin to the Tatar.\\n\\nLevin ate the oysters indeed, though white bread and cheese would have\\npleased him better. But he was admiring Oblonsky. Even the Tatar,\\nuncorking the bottle and pouring the sparkling wine into the delicate\\nglasses, glanced at Stepan Arkadyevitch, and settled his white cravat\\nwith a perceptible smile of satisfaction.\\n\\n“You don’t care much for oysters, do you?” said Stepan Arkadyevitch,\\nemptying his wine-glass, “or you’re worried about something. Eh?”\\n\\nHe wanted Levin to be in good spirits. But it was not that Levin was\\nnot in good spirits; he was ill at ease. With what he had in his soul,\\nhe felt sore and uncomfortable in the restaurant, in the midst of\\nprivate rooms where men were dining with ladies, in all this fuss and\\nbustle; the surroundings of bronzes, looking-glasses, gas, and\\nwaiters—all of it was offensive to him. He was afraid of sullying what\\nhis soul was brimful of.\\n\\n“I? Yes, I am; but besides, all this bothers me,” he said. “You can’t\\nconceive how queer it all seems to a country person like me, as queer\\nas that gentleman’s nails I saw at your place....”\\n\\n“Yes, I saw how much interested you were in poor Grinevitch’s nails,”\\nsaid Stepan Arkadyevitch, laughing.\\n\\n“It’s too much for me,” responded Levin. “Do try, now, and put yourself\\nin my place, take the point of view of a country person. We in the\\ncountry try to bring our hands into such a state as will be most\\nconvenient for working with. So we cut our nails; sometimes we turn up\\nour sleeves. And here people purposely let their nails grow as long as\\nthey will, and link on small saucers by way of studs, so that they can\\ndo nothing with their hands.”\\n\\nStepan Arkadyevitch smiled gaily.\\n\\n“Oh, yes, that’s just a sign that he has no need to do coarse work. His\\nwork is with the mind....”\\n\\n“Maybe. But still it’s queer to me, just as at this moment it seems\\nqueer to me that we country folks try to get our meals over as soon as\\nwe can, so as to be ready for our work, while here are we trying to\\ndrag out our meal as long as possible, and with that object eating\\noysters....”\\n\\n“Why, of course,” objected Stepan Arkadyevitch. “But that’s just the\\naim of civilization—to make everything a source of enjoyment.”\\n\\n“Well, if that’s its aim, I’d rather be a savage.”\\n\\n“And so you are a savage. All you Levins are savages.”\\n\\nLevin sighed. He remembered his brother Nikolay, and felt ashamed and\\nsore, and he scowled; but Oblonsky began speaking of a subject which at\\nonce drew his attention.\\n\\n“Oh, I say, are you going tonight to our people, the Shtcherbatskys’, I\\nmean?” he said, his eyes sparkling significantly as he pushed away the\\nempty rough shells, and drew the cheese towards him.\\n\\n“Yes, I shall certainly go,” replied Levin; “though I fancied the\\nprincess was not very warm in her invitation.”\\n\\n“What nonsense! That’s her manner.... Come, boy, the soup!... That’s\\nher manner—_grande dame,_” said Stepan Arkadyevitch. “I’m coming, too,\\nbut I have to go to the Countess Bonina’s rehearsal. Come, isn’t it\\ntrue that you’re a savage? How do you explain the sudden way in which\\nyou vanished from Moscow? The Shtcherbatskys were continually asking me\\nabout you, as though I ought to know. The only thing I know is that you\\nalways do what no one else does.”\\n\\n“Yes,” said Levin, slowly and with emotion, “you’re right. I am a\\nsavage. Only, my savageness is not in having gone away, but in coming\\nnow. Now I have come....”\\n\\n“Oh, what a lucky fellow you are!” broke in Stepan Arkadyevitch,\\nlooking into Levin’s eyes.\\n\\n“Why?”\\n\\n“‘I know a gallant steed by tokens sure,\\n\\nAnd by his eyes I know a youth in love,’”\\n\\n\\n\\ndeclaimed Stepan Arkadyevitch. “Everything is before you.”\\n\\n“Why, is it over for you already?”\\n\\n“No; not over exactly, but the future is yours, and the present is\\nmine, and the present—well, it’s not all that it might be.”\\n\\n“How so?”\\n\\n“Oh, things go wrong. But I don’t want to talk of myself, and besides I\\ncan’t explain it all,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch. “Well, why have you\\ncome to Moscow, then?... Hi! take away!” he called to the Tatar.\\n\\n“You guess?” responded Levin, his eyes like deep wells of light fixed\\non Stepan Arkadyevitch.\\n\\n“I guess, but I can’t be the first to talk about it. You can see by\\nthat whether I guess right or wrong,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, gazing\\nat Levin with a subtle smile.\\n\\n“Well, and what have you to say to me?” said Levin in a quivering\\nvoice, feeling that all the muscles of his face were quivering too.\\n“How do you look at the question?”\\n\\nStepan Arkadyevitch slowly emptied his glass of Chablis, never taking\\nhis eyes off Levin.\\n\\n“I?” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, “there’s nothing I desire so much as\\nthat—nothing! It would be the best thing that could be.”\\n\\n“But you’re not making a mistake? You know what we’re speaking of?”\\nsaid Levin, piercing him with his eyes. “You think it’s possible?”\\n\\n“I think it’s possible. Why not possible?”\\n\\n“No! do you really think it’s possible? No, tell me all you think! Oh,\\nbut if ... if refusal’s in store for me!... Indeed I feel sure....”\\n\\n“Why should you think that?” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, smiling at his\\nexcitement.\\n\\n“It seems so to me sometimes. That will be awful for me, and for her\\ntoo.”\\n\\n“Oh, well, anyway there’s nothing awful in it for a girl. Every girl’s\\nproud of an offer.”\\n\\n“Yes, every girl, but not she.”\\n\\nStepan Arkadyevitch smiled. He so well knew that feeling of Levin’s,\\nthat for him all the girls in the world were divided into two classes:\\none class—all the girls in the world except her, and those girls with\\nall sorts of human weaknesses, and very ordinary girls: the other\\nclass—she alone, having no weaknesses of any sort and higher than all\\nhumanity.\\n\\n“Stay, take some sauce,” he said, holding back Levin’s hand as it\\npushed away the sauce.\\n\\nLevin obediently helped himself to sauce, but would not let Stepan\\nArkadyevitch go on with his dinner.\\n\\n“No, stop a minute, stop a minute,” he said. “You must understand that\\nit’s a question of life and death for me. I have never spoken to anyone\\nof this. And there’s no one I could speak of it to, except you. You\\nknow we’re utterly unlike each other, different tastes and views and\\neverything; but I know you’re fond of me and understand me, and that’s\\nwhy I like you awfully. But for God’s sake, be quite straightforward\\nwith me.”\\n\\n“I tell you what I think,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, smiling. “But I’ll\\nsay more: my wife is a wonderful woman....” Stepan Arkadyevitch sighed,\\nremembering his position with his wife, and, after a moment’s silence,\\nresumed—“She has a gift of foreseeing things. She sees right through\\npeople; but that’s not all; she knows what will come to pass,\\nespecially in the way of marriages. She foretold, for instance, that\\nPrincess Shahovskaya would marry Brenteln. No one would believe it, but\\nit came to pass. And she’s on your side.”\\n\\n“How do you mean?”\\n\\n“It’s not only that she likes you—she says that Kitty is certain to be\\nyour wife.”\\n\\nAt these words Levin’s face suddenly lighted up with a smile, a smile\\nnot far from tears of emotion.\\n\\n“She says that!” cried Levin. “I always said she was exquisite, your\\nwife. There, that’s enough, enough said about it,” he said, getting up\\nfrom his seat.\\n\\n“All right, but do sit down.”\\n\\nBut Levin could not sit down. He walked with his firm tread twice up\\nand down the little cage of a room, blinked his eyelids that his tears\\nmight not fall, and only then sat down to the table.\\n\\n“You must understand,” said he, “it’s not love. I’ve been in love, but\\nit’s not that. It’s not my feeling, but a sort of force outside me has\\ntaken possession of me. I went away, you see, because I made up my mind\\nthat it could never be, you understand, as a happiness that does not\\ncome on earth; but I’ve struggled with myself, I see there’s no living\\nwithout it. And it must be settled.”\\n\\n“What did you go away for?”\\n\\n“Ah, stop a minute! Ah, the thoughts that come crowding on one! The\\nquestions one must ask oneself! Listen. You can’t imagine what you’ve\\ndone for me by what you said. I’m so happy that I’ve become positively\\nhateful; I’ve forgotten everything. I heard today that my brother\\nNikolay ... you know, he’s here ... I had even forgotten him. It seems\\nto me that he’s happy too. It’s a sort of madness. But one thing’s\\nawful.... Here, you’ve been married, you know the feeling ... it’s\\nawful that we—old—with a past ... not of love, but of sins ... are\\nbrought all at once so near to a creature pure and innocent; it’s\\nloathsome, and that’s why one can’t help feeling oneself unworthy.”\\n\\n“Oh, well, you’ve not many sins on your conscience.”\\n\\n“Alas! all the same,” said Levin, “when with loathing I go over my\\nlife, I shudder and curse and bitterly regret it.... Yes.”\\n\\n“What would you have? The world’s made so,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch.\\n\\n“The one comfort is like that prayer, which I always liked: ‘Forgive me\\nnot according to my unworthiness, but according to Thy\\nloving-kindness.’ That’s the only way she can forgive me 11\\n\\nLevin emptied his glass, and they were silent for a while.\\n\\n“There’s one other thing I ought to tell you. Do you know Vronsky?”\\nStepan Arkadyevitch asked Levin.\\n\\n“No, I don’t. Why do you ask?”\\n\\n“Give us another bottle,” Stepan Arkadyevitch directed the Tatar, who\\nwas filling up their glasses and fidgeting round them just when he was\\nnot wanted.\\n\\n“Why you ought to know Vronsky is that he’s one of your rivals.”\\n\\n“Who’s Vronsky?” said Levin, and his face was suddenly transformed from\\nthe look of childlike ecstasy which Oblonsky had just been admiring to\\nan angry and unpleasant expression.\\n\\n“Vronsky is one of the sons of Count Kirill Ivanovitch Vronsky, and one\\nof the finest specimens of the gilded youth of Petersburg. I made his\\nacquaintance in Tver when I was there on official business, and he came\\nthere for the levy of recruits. Fearfully rich, handsome, great\\nconnections, an aide-de-camp, and with all that a very nice,\\ngood-natured fellow. But he’s more than simply a good-natured fellow,\\nas I’ve found out here—he’s a cultivated man, too, and very\\nintelligent; he’s a man who’ll make his mark.”\\n\\nLevin scowled and was dumb.\\n\\n“Well, he turned up here soon after you’d gone, and as I can see, he’s\\nover head and ears in love with Kitty, and you know that her\\nmother....”\\n\\n“Excuse me, but I know nothing,” said Levin, frowning gloomily. And\\nimmediately he recollected his brother Nikolay and how hateful he was\\nto have been able to forget him.\\n\\n“You wait a bit, wait a bit,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, smiling and\\ntouching his hand. “I’ve told you what I know, and I repeat that in\\nthis delicate and tender matter, as far as one can conjecture, I\\nbelieve the chances are in your favor.”\\n\\nLevin dropped back in his chair; his face was pale.\\n\\n“But I would advise you to settle the thing as soon as may be,” pursued\\nOblonsky, filling up his glass.\\n\\n“No, thanks, I can’t drink any more,” said Levin, pushing away his\\nglass. “I shall be drunk.... Come, tell me how are you getting on?” he\\nwent on, obviously anxious to change the conversation.\\n\\n“One word more: in any case I advise you to settle the question soon.\\nTonight I don’t advise you to speak,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch. “Go\\nround tomorrow morning, make an offer in due form, and God bless\\nyou....”\\n\\n“Oh, do you still think of coming to me for some shooting? Come next\\nspring, do,” said Levin.\\n\\nNow his whole soul was full of remorse that he had begun this\\nconversation with Stepan Arkadyevitch. A feeling such as his was\\nprofaned by talk of the rivalry of some Petersburg officer, of the\\nsuppositions and the counsels of Stepan Arkadyevitch.\\n\\nStepan Arkadyevitch smiled. He knew what was passing in Levin’s soul.\\n\\n“I’ll come some day,” he said. “But women, my boy, they’re the pivot\\neverything turns upon. Things are in a bad way with me, very bad. And\\nit’s all through women. Tell me frankly now,” he pursued, picking up a\\ncigar and keeping one hand on his glass; “give me your advice.”\\n\\n“Why, what is it?”\\n\\n“I’ll tell you. Suppose you’re married, you love your wife, but you’re\\nfascinated by another woman....”\\n\\n“Excuse me, but I’m absolutely unable to comprehend how ... just as I\\ncan’t comprehend how I could now, after my dinner, go straight to a\\nbaker’s shop and steal a roll.”\\n\\nStepan Arkadyevitch’s eyes sparkled more than usual.\\n\\n“Why not? A roll will sometimes smell so good one can’t resist it.”\\n\\n“Himmlisch ist’s, wenn ich bezwungen\\n\\n  Meine irdische Begier;\\n\\nAber doch wenn’s nich gelungen\\n\\n  Hatt’ ich auch recht hübsch Plaisir!”\\n\\n\\n\\nAs he said this, Stepan Arkadyevitch smiled subtly. Levin, too, could\\nnot help smiling.\\n\\n“Yes, but joking apart,” resumed Stepan Arkadyevitch, “you must\\nunderstand that the woman is a sweet, gentle loving creature, poor and\\nlonely, and has sacrificed everything. Now, when the thing’s done,\\ndon’t you see, can one possibly cast her off? Even supposing one parts\\nfrom her, so as not to break up one’s family life, still, can one help\\nfeeling for her, setting her on her feet, softening her lot?”\\n\\n“Well, you must excuse me there. You know to me all women are divided\\ninto two classes ... at least no ... truer to say: there are women and\\nthere are ... I’ve never seen exquisite fallen beings, and I never\\nshall see them, but such creatures as that painted Frenchwoman at the\\ncounter with the ringlets are vermin to my mind, and all fallen women\\nare the same.”\\n\\n“But the Magdalen?”\\n\\n“Ah, drop that! Christ would never have said those words if He had\\nknown how they would be abused. Of all the Gospel those words are the\\nonly ones remembered. However, I’m not saying so much what I think, as\\nwhat I feel. I have a loathing for fallen women. You’re afraid of\\nspiders, and I of these vermin. Most likely you’ve not made a study of\\nspiders and don’t know their character; and so it is with me.”\\n\\n“It’s very well for you to talk like that; it’s very much like that\\ngentleman in Dickens who used to fling all difficult questions over his\\nright shoulder. But to deny the facts is no answer. What’s to be\\ndone—you tell me that, what’s to be done? Your wife gets older, while\\nyou’re full of life. Before you’ve time to look round, you feel that\\nyou can’t love your wife with love, however much you may esteem her.\\nAnd then all at once love turns up, and you’re done for, done for,”\\nStepan Arkadyevitch said with weary despair.\\n\\nLevin half smiled.\\n\\n“Yes, you’re done for,” resumed Oblonsky. “But what’s to be done?”\\n\\n“Don’t steal rolls.”\\n\\nStepan Arkadyevitch laughed outright.\\n\\n“Oh, moralist! But you must understand, there are two women; one\\ninsists only on her rights, and those rights are your love, which you\\ncan’t give her; and the other sacrifices everything for you and asks\\nfor nothing. What are you to do? How are you to act? There’s a fearful\\ntragedy in it.”\\n\\n“If you care for my profession of faith as regards that, I’ll tell you\\nthat I don’t believe there was any tragedy about it. And this is why.\\nTo my mind, love ... both the sorts of love, which you remember Plato\\ndefines in his Banquet, served as the test of men. Some men only\\nunderstand one sort, and some only the other. And those who only know\\nthe non-platonic love have no need to talk of tragedy. In such love\\nthere can be no sort of tragedy. ‘I’m much obliged for the\\ngratification, my humble respects’—that’s all the tragedy. And in\\nplatonic love there can be no tragedy, because in that love all is\\nclear and pure, because....”\\n\\nAt that instant Levin recollected his own sins and the inner conflict\\nhe had lived through. And he added unexpectedly:\\n\\n“But perhaps you are right. Very likely ... I don’t know, I don’t\\nknow.”\\n\\n“It’s this, don’t you see,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, “you’re very much\\nall of a piece. That’s your strong point and your failing. You have a\\ncharacter that’s all of a piece, and you want the whole of life to be\\nof a piece too—but that’s not how it is. You despise public official\\nwork because you want the reality to be invariably corresponding all\\nthe while with the aim—and that’s not how it is. You want a man’s work,\\ntoo, always to have a defined aim, and love and family life always to\\nbe undivided—and that’s not how it is. All the variety, all the charm,\\nall the beauty of life is made up of light and shadow.”\\n\\nLevin sighed and made no reply. He was thinking of his own affairs, and\\ndid not hear Oblonsky.\\n\\nAnd suddenly both of them felt that though they were friends, though\\nthey had been dining and drinking together, which should have drawn\\nthem closer, yet each was thinking only of his own affairs, and they\\nhad nothing to do with one another. Oblonsky had more than once\\nexperienced this extreme sense of aloofness, instead of intimacy,\\ncoming on after dinner, and he knew what to do in such cases.\\n\\n“Bill!” he called, and he went into the next room where he promptly\\ncame across an aide-de-camp of his acquaintance and dropped into\\nconversation with him about an actress and her protector. And at once\\nin the conversation with the aide-de-camp Oblonsky had a sense of\\nrelaxation and relief after the conversation with Levin, which always\\nput him to too great a mental and spiritual strain.\\n\\nWhen the Tatar appeared with a bill for twenty-six roubles and odd\\nkopecks, besides a tip for himself, Levin, who would another time have\\nbeen horrified, like anyone from the country, at his share of fourteen\\nroubles, did not notice it, paid, and set off homewards to dress and go\\nto the Shtcherbatskys’ there to decide his fate 12\\n\\nThe young Princess Kitty Shtcherbatskaya was eighteen. It was the first\\nwinter that she had been out in the world. Her success in society had\\nbeen greater than that of either of her elder sisters, and greater even\\nthan her mother had anticipated. To say nothing of the young men who\\ndanced at the Moscow balls being almost all in love with Kitty, two\\nserious suitors had already this first winter made their appearance:\\nLevin, and immediately after his departure, Count Vronsky.\\n\\nLevin’s appearance at the beginning of the winter, his frequent visits,\\nand evident love for Kitty, had led to the first serious conversations\\nbetween Kitty’s parents as to her future, and to disputes between them.\\nThe prince was on Levin’s side; he said he wished for nothing better\\nfor Kitty. The princess for her part, going round the question in the\\nmanner peculiar to women, maintained that Kitty was too young, that\\nLevin had done nothing to prove that he had serious intentions, that\\nKitty felt no great attraction to him, and other side issues; but she\\ndid not state the principal point, which was that she looked for a\\nbetter match for her daughter, and that Levin was not to her liking,\\nand she did not understand him. When Levin had abruptly departed, the\\nprincess was delighted, and said to her husband triumphantly: “You see\\nI was right.” When Vronsky appeared on the scene, she was still more\\ndelighted, confirmed in her opinion that Kitty was to make not simply a\\ngood, but a brilliant match.\\n\\nIn the mother’s eyes there could be no comparison between Vronsky and\\nLevin. She disliked in Levin his strange and uncompromising opinions\\nand his shyness in society, founded, as she supposed, on his pride and\\nhis queer sort of life, as she considered it, absorbed in cattle and\\npeasants. She did not very much like it that he, who was in love with\\nher daughter, had kept coming to the house for six weeks, as though he\\nwere waiting for something, inspecting, as though he were afraid he\\nmight be doing them too great an honor by making an offer, and did not\\nrealize that a man, who continually visits at a house where there is a\\nyoung unmarried girl, is bound to make his intentions clear. And\\nsuddenly, without doing so, he disappeared. “It’s as well he’s not\\nattractive enough for Kitty to have fallen in love with him,” thought\\nthe mother.\\n\\nVronsky satisfied all the mother’s desires. Very wealthy, clever, of\\naristocratic family, on the highroad to a brilliant career in the army\\nand at court, and a fascinating man. Nothing better could be wished\\nfor.\\n\\nVronsky openly flirted with Kitty at balls, danced with her, and came\\ncontinually to the house, consequently there could be no doubt of the\\nseriousness of his intentions. But, in spite of that, the mother had\\nspent the whole of that winter in a state of terrible anxiety and\\nagitation.\\n\\nPrincess Shtcherbatskaya had herself been married thirty years ago, her\\naunt arranging the match. Her husband, about whom everything was well\\nknown beforehand, had come, looked at his future bride, and been looked\\nat. The matchmaking aunt had ascertained and communicated their mutual\\nimpression. That impression had been favorable. Afterwards, on a day\\nfixed beforehand, the expected offer was made to her parents, and\\naccepted. All had passed very simply and easily. So it seemed, at\\nleast, to the princess. But over her own daughters she had felt how far\\nfrom simple and easy is the business, apparently so commonplace, of\\nmarrying off one’s daughters. The panics that had been lived through,\\nthe thoughts that had been brooded over, the money that had been\\nwasted, and the disputes with her husband over marrying the two elder\\ngirls, Darya and Natalia! Now, since the youngest had come out, she was\\ngoing through the same terrors, the same doubts, and still more violent\\nquarrels with her husband than she had over the elder girls. The old\\nprince, like all fathers indeed, was exceedingly punctilious on the\\nscore of the honor and reputation of his daughters. He was irrationally\\njealous over his daughters, especially over Kitty, who was his\\nfavorite. At every turn he had scenes with the princess for\\ncompromising her daughter. The princess had grown accustomed to this\\nalready with her other daughters, but now she felt that there was more\\nground for the prince’s touchiness. She saw that of late years much was\\nchanged in the manners of society, that a mother’s duties had become\\nstill more difficult. She saw that girls of Kitty’s age formed some\\nsort of clubs, went to some sort of lectures, mixed freely in men’s\\nsociety; drove about the streets alone, many of them did not curtsey,\\nand, what was the most important thing, all the girls were firmly\\nconvinced that to choose their husbands was their own affair, and not\\ntheir parents’. “Marriages aren’t made nowadays as they used to be,”\\nwas thought and said by all these young girls, and even by their\\nelders. But how marriages were made now, the princess could not learn\\nfrom anyone. The French fashion—of the parents arranging their\\nchildren’s future—was not accepted; it was condemned. The English\\nfashion of the complete independence of girls was also not accepted,\\nand not possible in Russian society. The Russian fashion of matchmaking\\nby the offices of intermediate persons was for some reason considered\\nunseemly; it was ridiculed by everyone, and by the princess herself.\\nBut how girls were to be married, and how parents were to marry them,\\nno one knew. Everyone with whom the princess had chanced to discuss the\\nmatter said the same thing: “Mercy on us, it’s high time in our day to\\ncast off all that old-fashioned business. It’s the young people have to\\nmarry; and not their parents; and so we ought to leave the young people\\nto arrange it as they choose.” It was very easy for anyone to say that\\nwho had no daughters, but the princess realized that in the process of\\ngetting to know each other, her daughter might fall in love, and fall\\nin love with someone who did not care to marry her or who was quite\\nunfit to be her husband. And, however much it was instilled into the\\nprincess that in our times young people ought to arrange their lives\\nfor themselves, she was unable to believe it, just as she would have\\nbeen unable to believe that, at any time whatever, the most suitable\\nplaythings for children five years old ought to be loaded pistols. And\\nso the princess was more uneasy over Kitty than she had been over her\\nelder sisters.\\n\\nNow she was afraid that Vronsky might confine himself to simply\\nflirting with her daughter. She saw that her daughter was in love with\\nhim, but tried to comfort herself with the thought that he was an\\nhonorable man, and would not do this. But at the same time she knew how\\neasy it is, with the freedom of manners of today, to turn a girl’s\\nhead, and how lightly men generally regard such a crime. The week\\nbefore, Kitty had told her mother of a conversation she had with\\nVronsky during a mazurka. This conversation had partly reassured the\\nprincess; but perfectly at ease she could not be. Vronsky had told\\nKitty that both he and his brother were so used to obeying their mother\\nthat they never made up their minds to any important undertaking\\nwithout consulting her. “And just now, I am impatiently awaiting my\\nmother’s arrival from Petersburg, as peculiarly fortunate,” he told\\nher.\\n\\nKitty had repeated this without attaching any significance to the\\nwords. But her mother saw them in a different light. She knew that the\\nold lady was expected from day to day, that she would be pleased at her\\nson’s choice, and she felt it strange that he should not make his offer\\nthrough fear of vexing his mother. However, she was so anxious for the\\nmarriage itself, and still more for relief from her fears, that she\\nbelieved it was so. Bitter as it was for the princess to see the\\nunhappiness of her eldest daughter, Dolly, on the point of leaving her\\nhusband, her anxiety over the decision of her youngest daughter’s fate\\nengrossed all her feelings. Today, with Levin’s reappearance, a fresh\\nsource of anxiety arose. She was afraid that her daughter, who had at\\none time, as she fancied, a feeling for Levin, might, from extreme\\nsense of honor, refuse Vronsky, and that Levin’s arrival might\\ngenerally complicate and delay the affair so near being concluded.\\n\\n“Why, has he been here long?” the princess asked about Levin, as they\\nreturned home.\\n\\n“He came today, mamma.”\\n\\n“There’s one thing I want to say....” began the princess, and from her\\nserious and alert face, Kitty guessed what it would be.\\n\\n“Mamma,” she said, flushing hotly and turning quickly to her, “please,\\nplease don’t say anything about that. I know, I know all about it.”\\n\\nShe wished for what her mother wished for, but the motives of her\\nmother’s wishes wounded her.\\n\\n“I only want to say that to raise hopes....”\\n\\n“Mamma, darling, for goodness’ sake, don’t talk about it. It’s so\\nhorrible to talk about it.”\\n\\n“I won’t,” said her mother, seeing the tears in her daughter’s eyes;\\n“but one thing, my love; you promised me you would have no secrets from\\nme. You won’t?”\\n\\n“Never, mamma, none,” answered Kitty, flushing a little, and looking\\nher mother straight in the face, “but there’s no use in my telling you\\nanything, and I ... I ... if I wanted to, I don’t know what to say or\\nhow.... I don’t know....”\\n\\n“No, she could not tell an untruth with those eyes,” thought the\\nmother, smiling at her agitation and happiness. The princess smiled\\nthat what was taking place just now in her soul seemed to the poor\\nchild so immense and so important 13\\n\\nAfter dinner, and till the beginning of the evening, Kitty was feeling\\na sensation akin to the sensation of a young man before a battle. Her\\nheart throbbed violently, and her thoughts would not rest on anything.\\n\\nShe felt that this evening, when they would both meet for the first\\ntime, would be a turning point in her life. And she was continually\\npicturing them to herself, at one moment each separately, and then both\\ntogether. When she mused on the past, she dwelt with pleasure, with\\ntenderness, on the memories of her relations with Levin. The memories\\nof childhood and of Levin’s friendship with her dead brother gave a\\nspecial poetic charm to her relations with him. His love for her, of\\nwhich she felt certain, was flattering and delightful to her; and it\\nwas pleasant for her to think of Levin. In her memories of Vronsky\\nthere always entered a certain element of awkwardness, though he was in\\nthe highest degree well-bred and at ease, as though there were some\\nfalse note—not in Vronsky, he was very simple and nice, but in herself,\\nwhile with Levin she felt perfectly simple and clear. But, on the other\\nhand, directly she thought of the future with Vronsky, there arose\\nbefore her a perspective of brilliant happiness; with Levin the future\\nseemed misty.\\n\\nWhen she went upstairs to dress, and looked into the looking-glass, she\\nnoticed with joy that it was one of her good days, and that she was in\\ncomplete possession of all her forces,—she needed this so for what lay\\nbefore her: she was conscious of external composure and free grace in\\nher movements.\\n\\nAt half-past seven she had only just gone down into the drawing-room,\\nwhen the footman announced, “Konstantin Dmitrievitch Levin.” The\\nprincess was still in her room, and the prince had not come in. “So it\\nis to be,” thought Kitty, and all the blood seemed to rush to her\\nheart. She was horrified at her paleness, as she glanced into the\\nlooking-glass. At that moment she knew beyond doubt that he had come\\nearly on purpose to find her alone and to make her an offer. And only\\nthen for the first time the whole thing presented itself in a new,\\ndifferent aspect; only then she realized that the question did not\\naffect her only—with whom she would be happy, and whom she loved—but\\nthat she would have that moment to wound a man whom she liked. And to\\nwound him cruelly. What for? Because he, dear fellow, loved her, was in\\nlove with her. But there was no help for it, so it must be, so it would\\nhave to be.\\n\\n“My God! shall I myself really have to say it to him?” she thought.\\n“Can I tell him I don’t love him? That will be a lie. What am I to say\\nto him? That I love someone else? No, that’s impossible. I’m going\\naway, I’m going away.”\\n\\nShe had reached the door, when she heard his step. “No! it’s not\\nhonest. What have I to be afraid of? I have done nothing wrong. What is\\nto be, will be! I’ll tell the truth. And with him one can’t be ill at\\nease. Here he is,” she said to herself, seeing his powerful, shy\\nfigure, with his shining eyes fixed on her. She looked straight into\\nhis face, as though imploring him to spare her, and gave her hand.\\n\\n“It’s not time yet; I think I’m too early,” he said glancing round the\\nempty drawing-room. When he saw that his expectations were realized,\\nthat there was nothing to prevent him from speaking, his face became\\ngloomy.\\n\\n“Oh, no,” said Kitty, and sat down at the table.\\n\\n“But this was just what I wanted, to find you alone,” he began, not\\nsitting down, and not looking at her, so as not to lose courage.\\n\\n“Mamma will be down directly. She was very much tired....\\nYesterday....”\\n\\nShe talked on, not knowing what her lips were uttering, and not taking\\nher supplicating and caressing eyes off him.\\n\\nHe glanced at her; she blushed, and ceased speaking.\\n\\n“I told you I did not know whether I should be here long ... that it\\ndepended on you....”\\n\\nShe dropped her head lower and lower, not knowing herself what answer\\nshe should make to what was coming.\\n\\n“That it depended on you,” he repeated. “I meant to say ... I meant to\\nsay ... I came for this ... to be my wife!” he brought out, not knowing\\nwhat he was saying; but feeling that the most terrible thing was said,\\nhe stopped short and looked at her....\\n\\nShe was breathing heavily, not looking at him. She was feeling ecstasy.\\nHer soul was flooded with happiness. She had never anticipated that the\\nutterance of love would produce such a powerful effect on her. But it\\nlasted only an instant. She remembered Vronsky. She lifted her clear,\\ntruthful eyes, and seeing his desperate face, she answered hastily:\\n\\n“That cannot be ... forgive me.”\\n\\nA moment ago, and how close she had been to him, of what importance in\\nhis life! And how aloof and remote from him she had become now!\\n\\n“It was bound to be so,” he said, not looking at her.\\n\\nHe bowed, and was meaning to retreat 14\\n\\nBut at that very moment the princess came in. There was a look of\\nhorror on her face when she saw them alone, and their disturbed faces.\\nLevin bowed to her, and said nothing. Kitty did not speak nor lift her\\neyes. “Thank God, she has refused him,” thought the mother, and her\\nface lighted up with the habitual smile with which she greeted her\\nguests on Thursdays. She sat down and began questioning Levin about his\\nlife in the country. He sat down again, waiting for other visitors to\\narrive, in order to retreat unnoticed.\\n\\nFive minutes later there came in a friend of Kitty’s, married the\\npreceding winter, Countess Nordston.\\n\\nShe was a thin, sallow, sickly, and nervous woman, with brilliant black\\neyes. She was fond of Kitty, and her affection for her showed itself,\\nas the affection of married women for girls always does, in the desire\\nto make a match for Kitty after her own ideal of married happiness; she\\nwanted her to marry Vronsky. Levin she had often met at the\\nShtcherbatskys’ early in the winter, and she had always disliked him.\\nHer invariable and favorite pursuit, when they met, consisted in making\\nfun of him.\\n\\n“I do like it when he looks down at me from the height of his grandeur,\\nor breaks off his learned conversation with me because I’m a fool, or\\nis condescending to me. I like that so; to see him condescending! I am\\nso glad he can’t bear me,” she used to say of him.\\n\\nShe was right, for Levin actually could not bear her, and despised her\\nfor what she was proud of and regarded as a fine characteristic—her\\nnervousness, her delicate contempt and indifference for everything\\ncoarse and earthly.\\n\\nThe Countess Nordston and Levin got into that relation with one another\\nnot seldom seen in society, when two persons, who remain externally on\\nfriendly terms, despise each other to such a degree that they cannot\\neven take each other seriously, and cannot even be offended by each\\nother.\\n\\nThe Countess Nordston pounced upon Levin at once.\\n\\n“Ah, Konstantin Dmitrievitch! So you’ve come back to our corrupt\\nBabylon,” she said, giving him her tiny, yellow hand, and recalling\\nwhat he had chanced to say early in the winter, that Moscow was a\\nBabylon. “Come, is Babylon reformed, or have you degenerated?” she\\nadded, glancing with a simper at Kitty.\\n\\n“It’s very flattering for me, countess, that you remember my words so\\nwell,” responded Levin, who had succeeded in recovering his composure,\\nand at once from habit dropped into his tone of joking hostility to the\\nCountess Nordston. “They must certainly make a great impression on\\nyou.”\\n\\n“Oh, I should think so! I always note them all down. Well, Kitty, have\\nyou been skating again?...”\\n\\nAnd she began talking to Kitty. Awkward as it was for Levin to withdraw\\nnow, it would still have been easier for him to perpetrate this\\nawkwardness than to remain all the evening and see Kitty, who glanced\\nat him now and then and avoided his eyes. He was on the point of\\ngetting up, when the princess, noticing that he was silent, addressed\\nhim.\\n\\n“Shall you be long in Moscow? You’re busy with the district council,\\nthough, aren’t you, and can’t be away for long?”\\n\\n“No, princess, I’m no longer a member of the council,” he said. “I have\\ncome up for a few days.”\\n\\n“There’s something the matter with him,” thought Countess Nordston,\\nglancing at his stern, serious face. “He isn’t in his old argumentative\\nmood. But I’ll draw him out. I do love making a fool of him before\\nKitty, and I’ll do it.”\\n\\n“Konstantin Dmitrievitch,” she said to him, “do explain to me, please,\\nwhat’s the meaning of it. You know all about such things. At home in\\nour village of Kaluga all the peasants and all the women have drunk up\\nall they possessed, and now they can’t pay us any rent. What’s the\\nmeaning of that? You always praise the peasants so.”\\n\\nAt that instant another lady came into the room, and Levin got up.\\n\\n“Excuse me, countess, but I really know nothing about it, and can’t\\ntell you anything,” he said, and looked round at the officer who came\\nin behind the lady.\\n\\n“That must be Vronsky,” thought Levin, and, to be sure of it, glanced\\nat Kitty. She had already had time to look at Vronsky, and looked round\\nat Levin. And simply from the look in her eyes, that grew unconsciously\\nbrighter, Levin knew that she loved that man, knew it as surely as if\\nshe had told him so in words. But what sort of a man was he? Now,\\nwhether for good or for ill, Levin could not choose but remain; he must\\nfind out what the man was like whom she loved.\\n\\nThere are people who, on meeting a successful rival, no matter in what,\\nare at once disposed to turn their backs on everything good in him, and\\nto see only what is bad. There are people, on the other hand, who\\ndesire above all to find in that lucky rival the qualities by which he\\nhas outstripped them, and seek with a throbbing ache at heart only what\\nis good. Levin belonged to the second class. But he had no difficulty\\nin finding what was good and attractive in Vronsky. It was apparent at\\nthe first glance. Vronsky was a squarely built, dark man, not very\\ntall, with a good-humored, handsome, and exceedingly calm and resolute\\nface. Everything about his face and figure, from his short-cropped\\nblack hair and freshly shaven chin down to his loosely fitting,\\nbrand-new uniform, was simple and at the same time elegant. Making way\\nfor the lady who had come in, Vronsky went up to the princess and then\\nto Kitty.\\n\\nAs he approached her, his beautiful eyes shone with a specially tender\\nlight, and with a faint, happy, and modestly triumphant smile (so it\\nseemed to Levin), bowing carefully and respectfully over her, he held\\nout his small broad hand to her.\\n\\nGreeting and saying a few words to everyone, he sat down without once\\nglancing at Levin, who had never taken his eyes off him.\\n\\n“Let me introduce you,” said the princess, indicating Levin.\\n“Konstantin Dmitrievitch Levin, Count Alexey Kirillovitch Vronsky.”\\n\\nVronsky got up and, looking cordially at Levin, shook hands with him.\\n\\n“I believe I was to have dined with you this winter,” he said, smiling\\nhis simple and open smile; “but you had unexpectedly left for the\\ncountry.”\\n\\n“Konstantin Dmitrievitch despises and hates town and us townspeople,”\\nsaid Countess Nordston.\\n\\n“My words must make a deep impression on you, since you remember them\\nso well,” said Levin, and, suddenly conscious that he had said just the\\nsame thing before, he reddened.\\n\\nVronsky looked at Levin and Countess Nordston, and smiled.\\n\\n“Are you always in the country?” he inquired. “I should think it must\\nbe dull in the winter.”\\n\\n“It’s not dull if one has work to do; besides, one’s not dull by\\noneself,” Levin replied abruptly.\\n\\n“I am fond of the country,” said Vronsky, noticing, and affecting not\\nto notice, Levin’s tone.\\n\\n“But I hope, count, you would not consent to live in the country\\nalways,” said Countess Nordston.\\n\\n“I don’t know; I have never tried for long. I experienced a queer\\nfeeling once,” he went on. “I never longed so for the country, Russian\\ncountry, with bast shoes and peasants, as when I was spending a winter\\nwith my mother in Nice. Nice itself is dull enough, you know. And\\nindeed, Naples and Sorrento are only pleasant for a short time. And\\nit’s just there that Russia comes back to me most vividly, and\\nespecially the country. It’s as though....”\\n\\nHe talked on, addressing both Kitty and Levin, turning his serene,\\nfriendly eyes from one to the other, and saying obviously just what\\ncame into his head.\\n\\nNoticing that Countess Nordston wanted to say something, he stopped\\nshort without finishing what he had begun, and listened attentively to\\nher.\\n\\nThe conversation did not flag for an instant, so that the princess, who\\nalways kept in reserve, in case a subject should be lacking, two heavy\\nguns—the relative advantages of classical and of modern education, and\\nuniversal military service—had not to move out either of them, while\\nCountess Nordston had not a chance of chaffing Levin.\\n\\nLevin wanted to, and could not, take part in the general conversation;\\nsaying to himself every instant, “Now go,” he still did not go, as\\nthough waiting for something.\\n\\nThe conversation fell upon table-turning and spirits, and Countess\\nNordston, who believed in spiritualism, began to describe the marvels\\nshe had seen.\\n\\n“Ah, countess, you really must take me, for pity’s sake do take me to\\nsee them! I have never seen anything extraordinary, though I am always\\non the lookout for it everywhere,” said Vronsky, smiling.\\n\\n“Very well, next Saturday,” answered Countess Nordston. “But you,\\nKonstantin Dmitrievitch, do you believe in it?” she asked Levin.\\n\\n“Why do you ask me? You know what I shall say.”\\n\\n“But I want to hear your opinion.”\\n\\n“My opinion,” answered Levin, “is only that this table-turning simply\\nproves that educated society—so called—is no higher than the peasants.\\nThey believe in the evil eye, and in witchcraft and omens, while\\nwe....”\\n\\n“Oh, then you don’t believe in it?”\\n\\n“I can’t believe in it, countess.”\\n\\n“But if I’ve seen it myself?”\\n\\n“The peasant women too tell us they have seen goblins.”\\n\\n“Then you think I tell a lie?”\\n\\nAnd she laughed a mirthless laugh.\\n\\n“Oh, no, Masha, Konstantin Dmitrievitch said he could not believe in\\nit,” said Kitty, blushing for Levin, and Levin saw this, and, still\\nmore exasperated, would have answered, but Vronsky with his bright\\nfrank smile rushed to the support of the conversation, which was\\nthreatening to become disagreeable.\\n\\n“You do not admit the conceivability at all?” he queried. “But why not?\\nWe admit the existence of electricity, of which we know nothing. Why\\nshould there not be some new force, still unknown to us, which....”\\n\\n“When electricity was discovered,” Levin interrupted hurriedly, “it was\\nonly the phenomenon that was discovered, and it was unknown from what\\nit proceeded and what were its effects, and ages passed before its\\napplications were conceived. But the spiritualists have begun with\\ntables writing for them, and spirits appearing to them, and have only\\nlater started saying that it is an unknown force.”\\n\\nVronsky listened attentively to Levin, as he always did listen,\\nobviously interested in his words.\\n\\n“Yes, but the spiritualists say we don’t know at present what this\\nforce is, but there is a force, and these are the conditions in which\\nit acts. Let the scientific men find out what the force consists in.\\nNo, I don’t see why there should not be a new force, if it....”\\n\\n“Why, because with electricity,” Levin interrupted again, “every time\\nyou rub tar against wool, a recognized phenomenon is manifested, but in\\nthis case it does not happen every time, and so it follows it is not a\\nnatural phenomenon.”\\n\\nFeeling probably that the conversation was taking a tone too serious\\nfor a drawing-room, Vronsky made no rejoinder, but by way of trying to\\nchange the conversation, he smiled brightly, and turned to the ladies.\\n\\n“Do let us try at once, countess,” he said; but Levin would finish\\nsaying what he thought.\\n\\n“I think,” he went on, “that this attempt of the spiritualists to\\nexplain their marvels as some sort of new natural force is most futile.\\nThey boldly talk of spiritual force, and then try to subject it to\\nmaterial experiment.”\\n\\nEveryone was waiting for him to finish, and he felt it.\\n\\n“And I think you would be a first-rate medium,” said Countess Nordston;\\n“there’s something enthusiastic in you.”\\n\\nLevin opened his mouth, was about to say something, reddened, and said\\nnothing.\\n\\n“Do let us try table-turning at once, please,” said Vronsky. “Princess,\\nwill you allow it?”\\n\\nAnd Vronsky stood up, looking for a little table.\\n\\nKitty got up to fetch a table, and as she passed, her eyes met Levin’s.\\nShe felt for him with her whole heart, the more because she was pitying\\nhim for suffering of which she was herself the cause. “If you can\\nforgive me, forgive me,” said her eyes, “I am so happy.”\\n\\n“I hate them all, and you, and myself,” his eyes responded, and he took\\nup his hat. But he was not destined to escape. Just as they were\\narranging themselves round the table, and Levin was on the point of\\nretiring, the old prince came in, and after greeting the ladies,\\naddressed Levin.\\n\\n“Ah!” he began joyously. “Been here long, my boy? I didn’t even know\\nyou were in town. Very glad to see you.” The old prince embraced Levin,\\nand talking to him did not observe Vronsky, who had risen, and was\\nserenely waiting till the prince should turn to him.\\n\\nKitty felt how distasteful her father’s warmth was to Levin after what\\nhad happened. She saw, too, how coldly her father responded at last to\\nVronsky’s bow, and how Vronsky looked with amiable perplexity at her\\nfather, as though trying and failing to understand how and why anyone\\ncould be hostilely disposed towards him, and she flushed.\\n\\n“Prince, let us have Konstantin Dmitrievitch,” said Countess Nordston;\\n“we want to try an experiment.”\\n\\n“What experiment? Table-turning? Well, you must excuse me, ladies and\\ngentlemen, but to my mind it is better fun to play the ring game,” said\\nthe old prince, looking at Vronsky, and guessing that it had been his\\nsuggestion. “There’s some sense in that, anyway.”\\n\\nVronsky looked wonderingly at the prince with his resolute eyes, and,\\nwith a faint smile, began immediately talking to Countess Nordston of\\nthe great ball that was to come off next week.\\n\\n“I hope you will be there?” he said to Kitty. As soon as the old prince\\nturned away from him, Levin went out unnoticed, and the last impression\\nhe carried away with him of that evening was the smiling, happy face of\\nKitty answering Vronsky’s inquiry about the ball 15\\n\\nAt the end of the evening Kitty told her mother of her conversation\\nwith Levin, and in spite of all the pity she felt for Levin, she was\\nglad at the thought that she had received an _offer_. She had no doubt\\nthat she had acted rightly. But after she had gone to bed, for a long\\nwhile she could not sleep. One impression pursued her relentlessly. It\\nwas Levin’s face, with his scowling brows, and his kind eyes looking\\nout in dark dejection below them, as he stood listening to her father,\\nand glancing at her and at Vronsky. And she felt so sorry for him that\\ntears came into her eyes. But immediately she thought of the man for\\nwhom she had given him up. She vividly recalled his manly, resolute\\nface, his noble self-possession, and the good nature conspicuous in\\neverything towards everyone. She remembered the love for her of the man\\nshe loved, and once more all was gladness in her soul, and she lay on\\nthe pillow, smiling with happiness. “I’m sorry, I’m sorry; but what\\ncould I do? It’s not my fault,” she said to herself; but an inner voice\\ntold her something else. Whether she felt remorse at having won Levin’s\\nlove, or at having refused him, she did not know. But her happiness was\\npoisoned by doubts. “Lord, have pity on us; Lord, have pity on us;\\nLord, have pity on us!” she repeated to herself, till she fell asleep.\\n\\nMeanwhile there took place below, in the prince’s little library, one\\nof the scenes so often repeated between the parents on account of their\\nfavorite daughter.\\n\\n“What? I’ll tell you what!” shouted the prince, waving his arms, and at\\nonce wrapping his squirrel-lined dressing-gown round him again. “That\\nyou’ve no pride, no dignity; that you’re disgracing, ruining your\\ndaughter by this vulgar, stupid matchmaking!”\\n\\n“But, really, for mercy’s sake, prince, what have I done?” said the\\nprincess, almost crying.\\n\\nShe, pleased and happy after her conversation with her daughter, had\\ngone to the prince to say good-night as usual, and though she had no\\nintention of telling him of Levin’s offer and Kitty’s refusal, still\\nshe hinted to her husband that she fancied things were practically\\nsettled with Vronsky, and that he would declare himself so soon as his\\nmother arrived. And thereupon, at those words, the prince had all at\\nonce flown into a passion, and began to use unseemly language.\\n\\n“What have you done? I’ll tell you what. First of all, you’re trying to\\ncatch an eligible gentleman, and all Moscow will be talking of it, and\\nwith good reason. If you have evening parties, invite everyone, don’t\\npick out the possible suitors. Invite all the young bucks. Engage a\\npiano player, and let them dance, and not as you do things nowadays,\\nhunting up good matches. It makes me sick, sick to see it, and you’ve\\ngone on till you’ve turned the poor wench’s head. Levin’s a thousand\\ntimes the better man. As for this little Petersburg swell, they’re\\nturned out by machinery, all on one pattern, and all precious rubbish.\\nBut if he were a prince of the blood, my daughter need not run after\\nanyone.”\\n\\n“But what have I done?”\\n\\n“Why, you’ve....” The prince was crying wrathfully.\\n\\n“I know if one were to listen to you,” interrupted the princess, “we\\nshould never marry our daughter. If it’s to be so, we’d better go into\\nthe country.”\\n\\n“Well, and we had better.”\\n\\n“But do wait a minute. Do I try and catch them? I don’t try to catch\\nthem in the least. A young man, and a very nice one, has fallen in love\\nwith her, and she, I fancy....”\\n\\n“Oh, yes, you fancy! And how if she really is in love, and he’s no more\\nthinking of marriage than I am!... Oh, that I should live to see it!\\nAh! spiritualism! Ah! Nice! Ah! the ball!” And the prince, imagining\\nthat he was mimicking his wife, made a mincing curtsey at each word.\\n“And this is how we’re preparing wretchedness for Kitty; and she’s\\nreally got the notion into her head....”\\n\\n“But what makes you suppose so?”\\n\\n“I don’t suppose; I know. We have eyes for such things, though\\nwomen-folk haven’t. I see a man who has serious intentions, that’s\\nLevin: and I see a peacock, like this feather-head, who’s only amusing\\nhimself.”\\n\\n“Oh, well, when once you get an idea into your head!...”\\n\\n“Well, you’ll remember my words, but too late, just as with Dolly.”\\n\\n“Well, well, we won’t talk of it,” the princess stopped him,\\nrecollecting her unlucky Dolly.\\n\\n“By all means, and good-night!”\\n\\nAnd signing each other with the cross, the husband and wife parted with\\na kiss, feeling that they each remained of their own opinion.\\n\\nThe princess had at first been quite certain that that evening had\\nsettled Kitty’s future, and that there could be no doubt of Vronsky’s\\nintentions, but her husband’s words had disturbed her. And returning to\\nher own room, in terror before the unknown future, she, too, like\\nKitty, repeated several times in her heart, “Lord, have pity; Lord,\\nhave pity; Lord, have pity 16\\n\\nVronsky had never had a real home life. His mother had been in her\\nyouth a brilliant society woman, who had had during her married life,\\nand still more afterwards, many love affairs notorious in the whole\\nfashionable world. His father he scarcely remembered, and he had been\\neducated in the Corps of Pages.\\n\\nLeaving the school very young as a brilliant officer, he had at once\\ngot into the circle of wealthy Petersburg army men. Although he did go\\nmore or less into Petersburg society, his love affairs had always\\nhitherto been outside it.\\n\\nIn Moscow he had for the first time felt, after his luxurious and\\ncoarse life at Petersburg, all the charm of intimacy with a sweet and\\ninnocent girl of his own rank, who cared for him. It never even entered\\nhis head that there could be any harm in his relations with Kitty. At\\nballs he danced principally with her. He was a constant visitor at\\ntheir house. He talked to her as people commonly do talk in society—all\\nsorts of nonsense, but nonsense to which he could not help attaching a\\nspecial meaning in her case. Although he said nothing to her that he\\ncould not have said before everybody, he felt that she was becoming\\nmore and more dependent upon him, and the more he felt this, the better\\nhe liked it, and the tenderer was his feeling for her. He did not know\\nthat his mode of behavior in relation to Kitty had a definite\\ncharacter, that it is courting young girls with no intention of\\nmarriage, and that such courting is one of the evil actions common\\namong brilliant young men such as he was. It seemed to him that he was\\nthe first who had discovered this pleasure, and he was enjoying his\\ndiscovery.\\n\\nIf he could have heard what her parents were saying that evening, if he\\ncould have put himself at the point of view of the family and have\\nheard that Kitty would be unhappy if he did not marry her, he would\\nhave been greatly astonished, and would not have believed it. He could\\nnot believe that what gave such great and delicate pleasure to him, and\\nabove all to her, could be wrong. Still less could he have believed\\nthat he ought to marry.\\n\\nMarriage had never presented itself to him as a possibility. He not\\nonly disliked family life, but a family, and especially a husband was,\\nin accordance with the views general in the bachelor world in which he\\nlived, conceived as something alien, repellant, and, above all,\\nridiculous.\\n\\nBut though Vronsky had not the least suspicion what the parents were\\nsaying, he felt on coming away from the Shtcherbatskys’ that the secret\\nspiritual bond which existed between him and Kitty had grown so much\\nstronger that evening that some step must be taken. But what step could\\nand ought to be taken he could not imagine.\\n\\n“What is so exquisite,” he thought, as he returned from the\\nShtcherbatskys’, carrying away with him, as he always did, a delicious\\nfeeling of purity and freshness, arising partly from the fact that he\\nhad not been smoking for a whole evening, and with it a new feeling of\\ntenderness at her love for him—“what is so exquisite is that not a word\\nhas been said by me or by her, but we understand each other so well in\\nthis unseen language of looks and tones, that this evening more clearly\\nthan ever she told me she loves me. And how secretly, simply, and most\\nof all, how trustfully! I feel myself better, purer. I feel that I have\\na heart, and that there is a great deal of good in me. Those sweet,\\nloving eyes! When she said: ‘Indeed I do....’\\n\\n“Well, what then? Oh, nothing. It’s good for me, and good for her.” And\\nhe began wondering where to finish the evening.\\n\\nHe passed in review of the places he might go to. “Club? a game of\\nbezique, champagne with Ignatov? No, I’m not going. _Château des\\nFleurs_; there I shall find Oblonsky, songs, the cancan. No, I’m sick\\nof it. That’s why I like the Shtcherbatskys’, that I’m growing better.\\nI’ll go home.” He went straight to his room at Dussots’ Hotel, ordered\\nsupper, and then undressed, and as soon as his head touched the pillow,\\nfell into a sound sleep 17\\n\\nNext day at eleven o’clock in the morning Vronsky drove to the station\\nof the Petersburg railway to meet his mother, and the first person he\\ncame across on the great flight of steps was Oblonsky, who was\\nexpecting his sister by the same train.\\n\\n“Ah! your excellency!” cried Oblonsky, “whom are you meeting?”\\n\\n“My mother,” Vronsky responded, smiling, as everyone did who met\\nOblonsky. He shook hands with him, and together they ascended the\\nsteps. “She is to be here from Petersburg today.”\\n\\n“I was looking out for you till two o’clock last night. Where did you\\ngo after the Shtcherbatskys’?”\\n\\n“Home,” answered Vronsky. “I must own I felt so well content yesterday\\nafter the Shtcherbatskys’ that I didn’t care to go anywhere.”\\n\\n“I know a gallant steed by tokens sure,\\n\\nAnd by his eyes I know a youth in love,”\\n\\n\\n\\ndeclaimed Stepan Arkadyevitch, just as he had done before to Levin.\\n\\nVronsky smiled with a look that seemed to say that he did not deny it,\\nbut he promptly changed the subject.\\n\\n“And whom are you meeting?” he asked.\\n\\n“I? I’ve come to meet a pretty woman,” said Oblonsky.\\n\\n“You don’t say so!”\\n\\n“_Honi soit qui mal y pense!_ My sister Anna.”\\n\\n“Ah! that’s Madame Karenina,” said Vronsky.\\n\\n“You know her, no doubt?”\\n\\n“I think I do. Or perhaps not ... I really am not sure,” Vronsky\\nanswered heedlessly, with a vague recollection of something stiff and\\ntedious evoked by the name Karenina.\\n\\n“But Alexey Alexandrovitch, my celebrated brother-in-law, you surely\\nmust know. All the world knows him.”\\n\\n“I know him by reputation and by sight. I know that he’s clever,\\nlearned, religious somewhat.... But you know that’s not ... _not in my\\nline,_” said Vronsky in English.\\n\\n“Yes, he’s a very remarkable man; rather a conservative, but a splendid\\nman,” observed Stepan Arkadyevitch, “a splendid man.”\\n\\n“Oh, well, so much the better for him,” said Vronsky smiling. “Oh,\\nyou’ve come,” he said, addressing a tall old footman of his mother’s,\\nstanding at the door; “come here.”\\n\\nBesides the charm Oblonsky had in general for everyone, Vronsky had\\nfelt of late specially drawn to him by the fact that in his imagination\\nhe was associated with Kitty.\\n\\n“Well, what do you say? Shall we give a supper on Sunday for the\\n_diva?_” he said to him with a smile, taking his arm.\\n\\n“Of course. I’m collecting subscriptions. Oh, did you make the\\nacquaintance of my friend Levin?” asked Stepan Arkadyevitch.\\n\\n“Yes; but he left rather early.”\\n\\n“He’s a capital fellow,” pursued Oblonsky. “Isn’t he?”\\n\\n“I don’t know why it is,” responded Vronsky, “in all Moscow\\npeople—present company of course excepted,” he put in jestingly,\\n“there’s something uncompromising. They are all on the defensive, lose\\ntheir tempers, as though they all want to make one feel something....”\\n\\n“Yes, that’s true, it is so,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, laughing\\ngood-humoredly.\\n\\n“Will the train soon be in?” Vronsky asked a railway official.\\n\\n“The train’s signaled,” answered the man.\\n\\nThe approach of the train was more and more evident by the preparatory\\nbustle in the station, the rush of porters, the movement of policemen\\nand attendants, and people meeting the train. Through the frosty vapor\\ncould be seen workmen in short sheepskins and soft felt boots crossing\\nthe rails of the curving line. The hiss of the boiler could be heard on\\nthe distant rails, and the rumble of something heavy.\\n\\n“No,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, who felt a great inclination to tell\\nVronsky of Levin’s intentions in regard to Kitty. “No, you’ve not got a\\ntrue impression of Levin. He’s a very nervous man, and is sometimes out\\nof humor, it’s true, but then he is often very nice. He’s such a true,\\nhonest nature, and a heart of gold. But yesterday there were special\\nreasons,” pursued Stepan Arkadyevitch, with a meaning smile, totally\\noblivious of the genuine sympathy he had felt the day before for his\\nfriend, and feeling the same sympathy now, only for Vronsky. “Yes,\\nthere were reasons why he could not help being either particularly\\nhappy or particularly unhappy.”\\n\\nVronsky stood still and asked directly: “How so? Do you mean he made\\nyour _belle-sœur_ an offer yesterday?”\\n\\n“Maybe,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch. “I fancied something of the sort\\nyesterday. Yes, if he went away early, and was out of humor too, it\\nmust mean it.... He’s been so long in love, and I’m very sorry for\\nhim.”\\n\\n“So that’s it! I should imagine, though, she might reckon on a better\\nmatch,” said Vronsky, drawing himself up and walking about again,\\n“though I don’t know him, of course,” he added. “Yes, that is a hateful\\nposition! That’s why most fellows prefer to have to do with Klaras. If\\nyou don’t succeed with them it only proves that you’ve not enough cash,\\nbut in this case one’s dignity’s at stake. But here’s the train.”\\n\\nThe engine had already whistled in the distance. A few instants later\\nthe platform was quivering, and with puffs of steam hanging low in the\\nair from the frost, the engine rolled up, with the lever of the middle\\nwheel rhythmically moving up and down, and the stooping figure of the\\nengine-driver covered with frost. Behind the tender, setting the\\nplatform more and more slowly swaying, came the luggage van with a dog\\nwhining in it. At last the passenger carriages rolled in, oscillating\\nbefore coming to a standstill.\\n\\nA smart guard jumped out, giving a whistle, and after him one by one\\nthe impatient passengers began to get down: an officer of the guards,\\nholding himself erect, and looking severely about him; a nimble little\\nmerchant with a satchel, smiling gaily; a peasant with a sack over his\\nshoulder.\\n\\nVronsky, standing beside Oblonsky, watched the carriages and the\\npassengers, totally oblivious of his mother. What he had just heard\\nabout Kitty excited and delighted him. Unconsciously he arched his\\nchest, and his eyes flashed. He felt himself a conqueror.\\n\\n“Countess Vronskaya is in that compartment,” said the smart guard,\\ngoing up to Vronsky.\\n\\nThe guard’s words roused him, and forced him to think of his mother and\\nhis approaching meeting with her. He did not in his heart respect his\\nmother, and without acknowledging it to himself, he did not love her,\\nthough in accordance with the ideas of the set in which he lived, and\\nwith his own education, he could not have conceived of any behavior to\\nhis mother not in the highest degree respectful and obedient, and the\\nmore externally obedient and respectful his behavior, the less in his\\nheart he respected and loved her 18\\n\\nVronsky followed the guard to the carriage, and at the door of the\\ncompartment he stopped short to make room for a lady who was getting\\nout.\\n\\nWith the insight of a man of the world, from one glance at this lady’s\\nappearance Vronsky classified her as belonging to the best society. He\\nbegged pardon, and was getting into the carriage, but felt he must\\nglance at her once more; not that she was very beautiful, not on\\naccount of the elegance and modest grace which were apparent in her\\nwhole figure, but because in the expression of her charming face, as\\nshe passed close by him, there was something peculiarly caressing and\\nsoft. As he looked round, she too turned her head. Her shining gray\\neyes, that looked dark from the thick lashes, rested with friendly\\nattention on his face, as though she were recognizing him, and then\\npromptly turned away to the passing crowd, as though seeking someone.\\nIn that brief look Vronsky had time to notice the suppressed eagerness\\nwhich played over her face, and flitted between the brilliant eyes and\\nthe faint smile that curved her red lips. It was as though her nature\\nwere so brimming over with something that against her will it showed\\nitself now in the flash of her eyes, and now in her smile. Deliberately\\nshe shrouded the light in her eyes, but it shone against her will in\\nthe faintly perceptible smile.\\n\\nVronsky stepped into the carriage. His mother, a dried-up old lady with\\nblack eyes and ringlets, screwed up her eyes, scanning her son, and\\nsmiled slightly with her thin lips. Getting up from the seat and\\nhanding her maid a bag, she gave her little wrinkled hand to her son to\\nkiss, and lifting his head from her hand, kissed him on the cheek.\\n\\n“You got my telegram? Quite well? Thank God.”\\n\\n“You had a good journey?” said her son, sitting down beside her, and\\ninvoluntarily listening to a woman’s voice outside the door. He knew it\\nwas the voice of the lady he had met at the door.\\n\\n“All the same I don’t agree with you,” said the lady’s voice.\\n\\n“It’s the Petersburg view, madame.”\\n\\n“Not Petersburg, but simply feminine,” she responded.\\n\\n“Well, well, allow me to kiss your hand.”\\n\\n“Good-bye, Ivan Petrovitch. And could you see if my brother is here,\\nand send him to me?” said the lady in the doorway, and stepped back\\nagain into the compartment.\\n\\n“Well, have you found your brother?” said Countess Vronskaya,\\naddressing the lady.\\n\\nVronsky understood now that this was Madame Karenina.\\n\\n“Your brother is here,” he said, standing up. “Excuse me, I did not\\nknow you, and, indeed, our acquaintance was so slight,” said Vronsky,\\nbowing, “that no doubt you do not remember me.”\\n\\n“Oh, no,” said she, “I should have known you because your mother and I\\nhave been talking, I think, of nothing but you all the way.” As she\\nspoke she let the eagerness that would insist on coming out show itself\\nin her smile. “And still no sign of my brother.”\\n\\n“Do call him, Alexey,” said the old countess. Vronsky stepped out onto\\nthe platform and shouted:\\n\\n“Oblonsky! Here!”\\n\\nMadame Karenina, however, did not wait for her brother, but catching\\nsight of him she stepped out with her light, resolute step. And as soon\\nas her brother had reached her, with a gesture that struck Vronsky by\\nits decision and its grace, she flung her left arm around his neck,\\ndrew him rapidly to her, and kissed him warmly. Vronsky gazed, never\\ntaking his eyes from her, and smiled, he could not have said why. But\\nrecollecting that his mother was waiting for him, he went back again\\ninto the carriage.\\n\\n“She’s very sweet, isn’t she?” said the countess of Madame Karenina.\\n“Her husband put her with me, and I was delighted to have her. We’ve\\nbeen talking all the way. And so you, I hear ... _vous filez le parfait\\namour. Tant mieux, mon cher, tant mieux._”\\n\\n“I don’t know what you are referring to, maman,” he answered coldly.\\n“Come, maman, let us go.”\\n\\nMadame Karenina entered the carriage again to say good-bye to the\\ncountess.\\n\\n“Well, countess, you have met your son, and I my brother,” she said.\\n“And all my gossip is exhausted. I should have nothing more to tell\\nyou.”\\n\\n“Oh, no,” said the countess, taking her hand. “I could go all around\\nthe world with you and never be dull. You are one of those delightful\\nwomen in whose company it’s sweet to be silent as well as to talk. Now\\nplease don’t fret over your son; you can’t expect never to be parted.”\\n\\nMadame Karenina stood quite still, holding herself very erect, and her\\neyes were smiling.\\n\\n“Anna Arkadyevna,” the countess said in explanation to her son, “has a\\nlittle son eight years old, I believe, and she has never been parted\\nfrom him before, and she keeps fretting over leaving him.”\\n\\n“Yes, the countess and I have been talking all the time, I of my son\\nand she of hers,” said Madame Karenina, and again a smile lighted up\\nher face, a caressing smile intended for him.\\n\\n“I am afraid that you must have been dreadfully bored,” he said,\\npromptly catching the ball of coquetry she had flung him. But\\napparently she did not care to pursue the conversation in that strain,\\nand she turned to the old countess.\\n\\n“Thank you so much. The time has passed so quickly. Good-bye,\\ncountess.”\\n\\n“Good-bye, my love,” answered the countess. “Let me have a kiss of your\\npretty face. I speak plainly, at my age, and I tell you simply that\\nI’ve lost my heart to you.”\\n\\nStereotyped as the phrase was, Madame Karenina obviously believed it\\nand was delighted by it. She flushed, bent down slightly, and put her\\ncheek to the countess’s lips, drew herself up again, and with the same\\nsmile fluttering between her lips and her eyes, she gave her hand to\\nVronsky. He pressed the little hand she gave him, and was delighted, as\\nthough at something special, by the energetic squeeze with which she\\nfreely and vigorously shook his hand. She went out with the rapid step\\nwhich bore her rather fully-developed figure with such strange\\nlightness.\\n\\n“Very charming,” said the countess.\\n\\nThat was just what her son was thinking. His eyes followed her till her\\ngraceful figure was out of sight, and then the smile remained on his\\nface. He saw out of the window how she went up to her brother, put her\\narm in his, and began telling him something eagerly, obviously\\nsomething that had nothing to do with him, Vronsky, and at that he felt\\nannoyed.\\n\\n“Well, maman, are you perfectly well?” he repeated, turning to his\\nmother.\\n\\n“Everything has been delightful. Alexander has been very good, and\\nMarie has grown very pretty. She’s very interesting.”\\n\\nAnd she began telling him again of what interested her most—the\\nchristening of her grandson, for which she had been staying in\\nPetersburg, and the special favor shown her elder son by the Tsar.\\n\\n“Here’s Lavrenty,” said Vronsky, looking out of the window; “now we can\\ngo, if you like.”\\n\\nThe old butler, who had traveled with the countess, came to the\\ncarriage to announce that everything was ready, and the countess got up\\nto go.\\n\\n“Come; there’s not such a crowd now,” said Vronsky.\\n\\nThe maid took a handbag and the lap dog, the butler and a porter the\\nother baggage. Vronsky gave his mother his arm; but just as they were\\ngetting out of the carriage several men ran suddenly by with\\npanic-stricken faces. The station-master, too, ran by in his\\nextraordinary colored cap. Obviously something unusual had happened.\\nThe crowd who had left the train were running back again.\\n\\n“What?... What?... Where?... Flung himself!... Crushed!...” was heard\\namong the crowd. Stepan Arkadyevitch, with his sister on his arm,\\nturned back. They too looked scared, and stopped at the carriage door\\nto avoid the crowd.\\n\\nThe ladies got in, while Vronsky and Stepan Arkadyevitch followed the\\ncrowd to find out details of the disaster.\\n\\nA guard, either drunk or too much muffled up in the bitter frost, had\\nnot heard the train moving back, and had been crushed.\\n\\nBefore Vronsky and Oblonsky came back the ladies heard the facts from\\nthe butler.\\n\\nOblonsky and Vronsky had both seen the mutilated corpse. Oblonsky was\\nevidently upset. He frowned and seemed ready to cry.\\n\\n“Ah, how awful! Ah, Anna, if you had seen it! Ah, how awful!” he said.\\n\\nVronsky did not speak; his handsome face was serious, but perfectly\\ncomposed.\\n\\n“Oh, if you had seen it, countess,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch. “And his\\nwife was there.... It was awful to see her!... She flung herself on the\\nbody. They say he was the only support of an immense family. How\\nawful!”\\n\\n“Couldn’t one do anything for her?” said Madame Karenina in an agitated\\nwhisper.\\n\\nVronsky glanced at her, and immediately got out of the carriage.\\n\\n“I’ll be back directly, maman,” he remarked, turning round in the\\ndoorway.\\n\\nWhen he came back a few minutes later, Stepan Arkadyevitch was already\\nin conversation with the countess about the new singer, while the\\ncountess was impatiently looking towards the door, waiting for her son.\\n\\n“Now let us be off,” said Vronsky, coming in. They went out together.\\nVronsky was in front with his mother. Behind walked Madame Karenina\\nwith her brother. Just as they were going out of the station the\\nstation-master overtook Vronsky.\\n\\n“You gave my assistant two hundred roubles. Would you kindly explain\\nfor whose benefit you intend them?”\\n\\n“For the widow,” said Vronsky, shrugging his shoulders. “I should have\\nthought there was no need to ask.”\\n\\n“You gave that?” cried Oblonsky, behind, and, pressing his sister’s\\nhand, he added: “Very nice, very nice! Isn’t he a splendid fellow?\\nGood-bye, countess.”\\n\\nAnd he and his sister stood still, looking for her maid.\\n\\nWhen they went out the Vronsky’s carriage had already driven away.\\nPeople coming in were still talking of what happened.\\n\\n“What a horrible death!” said a gentleman, passing by. “They say he was\\ncut in two pieces.”\\n\\n“On the contrary, I think it’s the easiest—instantaneous,” observed\\nanother.\\n\\n“How is it they don’t take proper precautions?” said a third.\\n\\nMadame Karenina seated herself in the carriage, and Stepan Arkadyevitch\\nsaw with surprise that her lips were quivering, and she was with\\ndifficulty restraining her tears.\\n\\n“What is it, Anna?” he asked, when they had driven a few hundred yards.\\n\\n“It’s an omen of evil,” she said.\\n\\n“What nonsense!” said Stepan Arkadyevitch. “You’ve come, that’s the\\nchief thing. You can’t conceive how I’m resting my hopes on you.”\\n\\n“Have you known Vronsky long?” she asked.\\n\\n“Yes. You know we’re hoping he will marry Kitty.”\\n\\n“Yes?” said Anna softly. “Come now, let us talk of you,” she added,\\ntossing her head, as though she would physically shake off something\\nsuperfluous oppressing her. “Let us talk of your affairs. I got your\\nletter, and here I am.”\\n\\n“Yes, all my hopes are in you,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch.\\n\\n“Well, tell me all about it.”\\n\\nAnd Stepan Arkadyevitch began to tell his story.\\n\\nOn reaching home Oblonsky helped his sister out, sighed, pressed her\\nhand, and set off to his office 19\\n\\nWhen Anna went into the room, Dolly was sitting in the little\\ndrawing-room with a white-headed fat little boy, already like his\\nfather, giving him a lesson in French reading. As the boy read, he kept\\ntwisting and trying to tear off a button that was nearly off his\\njacket. His mother had several times taken his hand from it, but the\\nfat little hand went back to the button again. His mother pulled the\\nbutton off and put it in her pocket.\\n\\n“Keep your hands still, Grisha,” she said, and she took up her work, a\\ncoverlet she had long been making. She always set to work on it at\\ndepressed moments, and now she knitted at it nervously, twitching her\\nfingers and counting the stitches. Though she had sent word the day\\nbefore to her husband that it was nothing to her whether his sister\\ncame or not, she had made everything ready for her arrival, and was\\nexpecting her sister-in-law with emotion.\\n\\nDolly was crushed by her sorrow, utterly swallowed up by it. Still she\\ndid not forget that Anna, her sister-in-law, was the wife of one of the\\nmost important personages in Petersburg, and was a Petersburg _grande\\ndame_. And, thanks to this circumstance, she did not carry out her\\nthreat to her husband—that is to say, she remembered that her\\nsister-in-law was coming. “And, after all, Anna is in no wise to\\nblame,” thought Dolly. “I know nothing of her except the very best, and\\nI have seen nothing but kindness and affection from her towards\\nmyself.” It was true that as far as she could recall her impressions at\\nPetersburg at the Karenins’, she did not like their household itself;\\nthere was something artificial in the whole framework of their family\\nlife. “But why should I not receive her? If only she doesn’t take it\\ninto her head to console me!” thought Dolly. “All consolation and\\ncounsel and Christian forgiveness, all that I have thought over a\\nthousand times, and it’s all no use.”\\n\\nAll these days Dolly had been alone with her children. She did not want\\nto talk of her sorrow, but with that sorrow in her heart she could not\\ntalk of outside matters. She knew that in one way or another she would\\ntell Anna everything, and she was alternately glad at the thought of\\nspeaking freely, and angry at the necessity of speaking of her\\nhumiliation with her, his sister, and of hearing her ready-made phrases\\nof good advice and comfort. She had been on the lookout for her,\\nglancing at her watch every minute, and, as so often happens, let slip\\njust that minute when her visitor arrived, so that she did not hear the\\nbell.\\n\\nCatching a sound of skirts and light steps at the door, she looked\\nround, and her care-worn face unconsciously expressed not gladness, but\\nwonder. She got up and embraced her sister-in-law.\\n\\n“What, here already!” she said as she kissed her.\\n\\n“Dolly, how glad I am to see you!”\\n\\n“I am glad, too,” said Dolly, faintly smiling, and trying by the\\nexpression of Anna’s face to find out whether she knew. “Most likely\\nshe knows,” she thought, noticing the sympathy in Anna’s face. “Well,\\ncome along, I’ll take you to your room,” she went on, trying to defer\\nas long as possible the moment of confidences.\\n\\n“Is this Grisha? Heavens, how he’s grown!” said Anna; and kissing him,\\nnever taking her eyes off Dolly, she stood still and flushed a little.\\n“No, please, let us stay here.”\\n\\nShe took off her kerchief and her hat, and catching it in a lock of her\\nblack hair, which was a mass of curls, she tossed her head and shook\\nher hair down.\\n\\n“You are radiant with health and happiness!” said Dolly, almost with\\nenvy.\\n\\n“I?... Yes,” said Anna. “Merciful heavens, Tanya! You’re the same age\\nas my Seryozha,” she added, addressing the little girl as she ran in.\\nShe took her in her arms and kissed her. “Delightful child, delightful!\\nShow me them all.”\\n\\nShe mentioned them, not only remembering the names, but the years,\\nmonths, characters, illnesses of all the children, and Dolly could not\\nbut appreciate that.\\n\\n“Very well, we will go to them,” she said. “It’s a pity Vassya’s\\nasleep.”\\n\\nAfter seeing the children, they sat down, alone now, in the\\ndrawing-room, to coffee. Anna took the tray, and then pushed it away\\nfrom her.\\n\\n“Dolly,” she said, “he has told me.”\\n\\nDolly looked coldly at Anna; she was waiting now for phrases of\\nconventional sympathy, but Anna said nothing of the sort.\\n\\n“Dolly, dear,” she said, “I don’t want to speak for him to you, nor to\\ntry to comfort you; that’s impossible. But, darling, I’m simply sorry,\\nsorry from my heart for you!”\\n\\nUnder the thick lashes of her shining eyes tears suddenly glittered.\\nShe moved nearer to her sister-in-law and took her hand in her vigorous\\nlittle hand. Dolly did not shrink away, but her face did not lose its\\nfrigid expression. She said:\\n\\n“To comfort me’s impossible. Everything’s lost after what has happened,\\neverything’s over!”\\n\\nAnd directly she had said this, her face suddenly softened. Anna lifted\\nthe wasted, thin hand of Dolly, kissed it and said:\\n\\n“But, Dolly, what’s to be done, what’s to be done? How is it best to\\nact in this awful position—that’s what you must think of.”\\n\\n“All’s over, and there’s nothing more,” said Dolly. “And the worst of\\nall is, you see, that I can’t cast him off: there are the children, I\\nam tied. And I can’t live with him! it’s a torture to me to see him.”\\n\\n“Dolly, darling, he has spoken to me, but I want to hear it from you:\\ntell me about it.”\\n\\nDolly looked at her inquiringly.\\n\\nSympathy and love unfeigned were visible on Anna’s face.\\n\\n“Very well,” she said all at once. “But I will tell you it from the\\nbeginning. You know how I was married. With the education mamma gave us\\nI was more than innocent, I was stupid. I knew nothing. I know they say\\nmen tell their wives of their former lives, but Stiva”—she corrected\\nherself—“Stepan Arkadyevitch told me nothing. You’ll hardly believe it,\\nbut till now I imagined that I was the only woman he had known. So I\\nlived eight years. You must understand that I was so far from\\nsuspecting infidelity, I regarded it as impossible, and then—try to\\nimagine it—with such ideas, to find out suddenly all the horror, all\\nthe loathsomeness.... You must try and understand me. To be fully\\nconvinced of one’s happiness, and all at once....” continued Dolly,\\nholding back her sobs, “to get a letter ... his letter to his mistress,\\nmy governess. No, it’s too awful!” She hastily pulled out her\\nhandkerchief and hid her face in it. “I can understand being carried\\naway by feeling,” she went on after a brief silence, “but deliberately,\\nslyly deceiving me ... and with whom?... To go on being my husband\\ntogether with her ... it’s awful! You can’t understand....”\\n\\n“Oh, yes, I understand! I understand! Dolly, dearest, I do understand,”\\nsaid Anna, pressing her hand.\\n\\n“And do you imagine he realizes all the awfulness of my position?”\\nDolly resumed. “Not the slightest! He’s happy and contented.”\\n\\n“Oh, no!” Anna interposed quickly. “He’s to be pitied, he’s weighed\\ndown by remorse....”\\n\\n“Is he capable of remorse?” Dolly interrupted, gazing intently into her\\nsister-in-law’s face.\\n\\n“Yes. I know him. I could not look at him without feeling sorry for\\nhim. We both know him. He’s good-hearted, but he’s proud, and now he’s\\nso humiliated. What touched me most....” (and here Anna guessed what\\nwould touch Dolly most) “he’s tortured by two things: that he’s ashamed\\nfor the children’s sake, and that, loving you—yes, yes, loving you\\nbeyond everything on earth,” she hurriedly interrupted Dolly, who would\\nhave answered—“he has hurt you, pierced you to the heart. ‘No, no, she\\ncannot forgive me,’ he keeps saying.”\\n\\nDolly looked dreamily away beyond her sister-in-law as she listened to\\nher words.\\n\\n“Yes, I can see that his position is awful; it’s worse for the guilty\\nthan the innocent,” she said, “if he feels that all the misery comes\\nfrom his fault. But how am I to forgive him, how am I to be his wife\\nagain after her? For me to live with him now would be torture, just\\nbecause I love my past love for him....”\\n\\nAnd sobs cut short her words. But as though of set design, each time\\nshe was softened she began to speak again of what exasperated her.\\n\\n“She’s young, you see, she’s pretty,” she went on. “Do you know, Anna,\\nmy youth and my beauty are gone, taken by whom? By him and his\\nchildren. I have worked for him, and all I had has gone in his service,\\nand now of course any fresh, vulgar creature has more charm for him. No\\ndoubt they talked of me together, or, worse still, they were silent. Do\\nyou understand?”\\n\\nAgain her eyes glowed with hatred.\\n\\n“And after that he will tell me.... What! can I believe him? Never! No,\\neverything is over, everything that once made my comfort, the reward of\\nmy work, and my sufferings.... Would you believe it, I was teaching\\nGrisha just now: once this was a joy to me, now it is a torture. What\\nhave I to strive and toil for? Why are the children here? What’s so\\nawful is that all at once my heart’s turned, and instead of love and\\ntenderness, I have nothing but hatred for him; yes, hatred. I could\\nkill him.”\\n\\n“Darling Dolly, I understand, but don’t torture yourself. You are so\\ndistressed, so overwrought, that you look at many things mistakenly.”\\n\\nDolly grew calmer, and for two minutes both were silent.\\n\\n“What’s to be done? Think for me, Anna, help me. I have thought over\\neverything, and I see nothing.”\\n\\nAnna could think of nothing, but her heart responded instantly to each\\nword, to each change of expression of her sister-in-law.\\n\\n“One thing I would say,” began Anna. “I am his sister, I know his\\ncharacter, that faculty of forgetting everything, everything” (she\\nwaved her hand before her forehead), “that faculty for being completely\\ncarried away, but for completely repenting too. He cannot believe it,\\nhe cannot comprehend now how he can have acted as he did.”\\n\\n“No; he understands, he understood!” Dolly broke in. “But I ... you are\\nforgetting me ... does it make it easier for me?”\\n\\n“Wait a minute. When he told me, I will own I did not realize all the\\nawfulness of your position. I saw nothing but him, and that the family\\nwas broken up. I felt sorry for him, but after talking to you, I see\\nit, as a woman, quite differently. I see your agony, and I can’t tell\\nyou how sorry I am for you! But, Dolly, darling, I fully realize your\\nsufferings, only there is one thing I don’t know; I don’t know ... I\\ndon’t know how much love there is still in your heart for him. That you\\nknow—whether there is enough for you to be able to forgive him. If\\nthere is, forgive him!”\\n\\n“No,” Dolly was beginning, but Anna cut her short, kissing her hand\\nonce more.\\n\\n“I know more of the world than you do,” she said. “I know how men like\\nStiva look at it. You speak of his talking of you with her. That never\\nhappened. Such men are unfaithful, but their home and wife are sacred\\nto them. Somehow or other these women are still looked on with contempt\\nby them, and do not touch on their feeling for their family. They draw\\na sort of line that can’t be crossed between them and their families. I\\ndon’t understand it, but it is so.”\\n\\n“Yes, but he has kissed her....”\\n\\n“Dolly, hush, darling. I saw Stiva when he was in love with you. I\\nremember the time when he came to me and cried, talking of you, and all\\nthe poetry and loftiness of his feeling for you, and I know that the\\nlonger he has lived with you the loftier you have been in his eyes. You\\nknow we have sometimes laughed at him for putting in at every word:\\n‘Dolly’s a marvelous woman.’ You have always been a divinity for him,\\nand you are that still, and this has not been an infidelity of the\\nheart....”\\n\\n“But if it is repeated?”\\n\\n“It cannot be, as I understand it....”\\n\\n“Yes, but could you forgive it?”\\n\\n“I don’t know, I can’t judge.... Yes, I can,” said Anna, thinking a\\nmoment; and grasping the position in her thought and weighing it in her\\ninner balance, she added: “Yes, I can, I can, I can. Yes, I could\\nforgive it. I could not be the same, no; but I could forgive it, and\\nforgive it as though it had never been, never been at all....”\\n\\n“Oh, of course,” Dolly interposed quickly, as though saying what she\\nhad more than once thought, “else it would not be forgiveness. If one\\nforgives, it must be completely, completely. Come, let us go; I’ll take\\nyou to your room,” she said, getting up, and on the way she embraced\\nAnna. “My dear, how glad I am you came. It has made things better, ever\\nso much better 20\\n\\nThe whole of that day Anna spent at home, that’s to say at the\\nOblonskys’, and received no one, though some of her acquaintances had\\nalready heard of her arrival, and came to call the same day. Anna spent\\nthe whole morning with Dolly and the children. She merely sent a brief\\nnote to her brother to tell him that he must not fail to dine at home.\\n“Come, God is merciful,” she wrote.\\n\\nOblonsky did dine at home: the conversation was general, and his wife,\\nspeaking to him, addressed him as “Stiva,” as she had not done before.\\nIn the relations of the husband and wife the same estrangement still\\nremained, but there was no talk now of separation, and Stepan\\nArkadyevitch saw the possibility of explanation and reconciliation.\\n\\nImmediately after dinner Kitty came in. She knew Anna Arkadyevna, but\\nonly very slightly, and she came now to her sister’s with some\\ntrepidation, at the prospect of meeting this fashionable Petersburg\\nlady, whom everyone spoke so highly of. But she made a favorable\\nimpression on Anna Arkadyevna—she saw that at once. Anna was\\nunmistakably admiring her loveliness and her youth: before Kitty knew\\nwhere she was she found herself not merely under Anna’s sway, but in\\nlove with her, as young girls do fall in love with older and married\\nwomen. Anna was not like a fashionable lady, nor the mother of a boy of\\neight years old. In the elasticity of her movements, the freshness and\\nthe unflagging eagerness which persisted in her face, and broke out in\\nher smile and her glance, she would rather have passed for a girl of\\ntwenty, had it not been for a serious and at times mournful look in her\\neyes, which struck and attracted Kitty. Kitty felt that Anna was\\nperfectly simple and was concealing nothing, but that she had another\\nhigher world of interests inaccessible to her, complex and poetic.\\n\\nAfter dinner, when Dolly went away to her own room, Anna rose quickly\\nand went up to her brother, who was just lighting a cigar.\\n\\n“Stiva,” she said to him, winking gaily, crossing him and glancing\\ntowards the door, “go, and God help you.”\\n\\nHe threw down the cigar, understanding her, and departed through the\\ndoorway.\\n\\nWhen Stepan Arkadyevitch had disappeared, she went back to the sofa\\nwhere she had been sitting, surrounded by the children. Either because\\nthe children saw that their mother was fond of this aunt, or that they\\nfelt a special charm in her themselves, the two elder ones, and the\\nyounger following their lead, as children so often do, had clung about\\ntheir new aunt since before dinner, and would not leave her side. And\\nit had become a sort of game among them to sit as close as possible to\\ntheir aunt, to touch her, hold her little hand, kiss it, play with her\\nring, or even touch the flounce of her skirt.\\n\\n“Come, come, as we were sitting before,” said Anna Arkadyevna, sitting\\ndown in her place.\\n\\nAnd again Grisha poked his little face under her arm, and nestled with\\nhis head on her gown, beaming with pride and happiness.\\n\\n“And when is your next ball?” she asked Kitty.\\n\\n“Next week, and a splendid ball. One of those balls where one always\\nenjoys oneself.”\\n\\n“Why, are there balls where one always enjoys oneself?” Anna said, with\\ntender irony.\\n\\n“It’s strange, but there are. At the Bobrishtchevs’ one always enjoys\\noneself, and at the Nikitins’ too, while at the Mezhkovs’ it’s always\\ndull. Haven’t you noticed it?”\\n\\n“No, my dear, for me there are no balls now where one enjoys oneself,”\\nsaid Anna, and Kitty detected in her eyes that mysterious world which\\nwas not open to her. “For me there are some less dull and tiresome.”\\n\\n“How can _you_ be dull at a ball?”\\n\\n“Why should not _I_ be dull at a ball?” inquired Anna.\\n\\nKitty perceived that Anna knew what answer would follow.\\n\\n“Because you always look nicer than anyone.”\\n\\nAnna had the faculty of blushing. She blushed a little, and said:\\n\\n“In the first place it’s never so; and secondly, if it were, what\\ndifference would it make to me?”\\n\\n“Are you coming to this ball?” asked Kitty.\\n\\n“I imagine it won’t be possible to avoid going. Here, take it,” she\\nsaid to Tanya, who was pulling the loosely-fitting ring off her white,\\nslender-tipped finger.\\n\\n“I shall be so glad if you go. I should so like to see you at a ball.”\\n\\n“Anyway, if I do go, I shall comfort myself with the thought that it’s\\na pleasure to you ... Grisha, don’t pull my hair. It’s untidy enough\\nwithout that,” she said, putting up a straying lock, which Grisha had\\nbeen playing with.\\n\\n“I imagine you at the ball in lilac.”\\n\\n“And why in lilac precisely?” asked Anna, smiling. “Now, children, run\\nalong, run along. Do you hear? Miss Hoole is calling you to tea,” she\\nsaid, tearing the children from her, and sending them off to the\\ndining-room.\\n\\n“I know why you press me to come to the ball. You expect a great deal\\nof this ball, and you want everyone to be there to take part in it.”\\n\\n“How do you know? Yes.”\\n\\n“Oh! what a happy time you are at,” pursued Anna. “I remember, and I\\nknow that blue haze like the mist on the mountains in Switzerland. That\\nmist which covers everything in that blissful time when childhood is\\njust ending, and out of that vast circle, happy and gay, there is a\\npath growing narrower and narrower, and it is delightful and alarming\\nto enter the ballroom, bright and splendid as it is.... Who has not\\nbeen through it?”\\n\\nKitty smiled without speaking. “But how did she go through it? How I\\nshould like to know all her love story!” thought Kitty, recalling the\\nunromantic appearance of Alexey Alexandrovitch, her husband.\\n\\n“I know something. Stiva told me, and I congratulate you. I liked him\\nso much,” Anna continued. “I met Vronsky at the railway station.”\\n\\n“Oh, was he there?” asked Kitty, blushing. “What was it Stiva told\\nyou?”\\n\\n“Stiva gossiped about it all. And I should be so glad ... I traveled\\nyesterday with Vronsky’s mother,” she went on; “and his mother talked\\nwithout a pause of him, he’s her favorite. I know mothers are partial,\\nbut....”\\n\\n“What did his mother tell you?”\\n\\n“Oh, a great deal! And I know that he’s her favorite; still one can see\\nhow chivalrous he is.... Well, for instance, she told me that he had\\nwanted to give up all his property to his brother, that he had done\\nsomething extraordinary when he was quite a child, saved a woman out of\\nthe water. He’s a hero, in fact,” said Anna, smiling and recollecting\\nthe two hundred roubles he had given at the station.\\n\\nBut she did not tell Kitty about the two hundred roubles. For some\\nreason it was disagreeable to her to think of it. She felt that there\\nwas something that had to do with her in it, and something that ought\\nnot to have been.\\n\\n“She pressed me very much to go and see her,” Anna went on; “and I\\nshall be glad to go to see her tomorrow. Stiva is staying a long while\\nin Dolly’s room, thank God,” Anna added, changing the subject, and\\ngetting up, Kitty fancied, displeased with something.\\n\\n“No, I’m first! No, I!” screamed the children, who had finished tea,\\nrunning up to their Aunt Anna.\\n\\n“All together,” said Anna, and she ran laughing to meet them, and\\nembraced and swung round all the throng of swarming children, shrieking\\nwith delight 21\\n\\nDolly came out of her room to the tea of the grown-up people. Stepan\\nArkadyevitch did not come out. He must have left his wife’s room by the\\nother door.\\n\\n“I am afraid you’ll be cold upstairs,” observed Dolly, addressing Anna;\\n“I want to move you downstairs, and we shall be nearer.”\\n\\n“Oh, please, don’t trouble about me,” answered Anna, looking intently\\ninto Dolly’s face, trying to make out whether there had been a\\nreconciliation or not.\\n\\n“It will be lighter for you here,” answered her sister-in-law.\\n\\n“I assure you that I sleep everywhere, and always like a marmot.”\\n\\n“What’s the question?” inquired Stepan Arkadyevitch, coming out of his\\nroom and addressing his wife.\\n\\nFrom his tone both Kitty and Anna knew that a reconciliation had taken\\nplace.\\n\\n“I want to move Anna downstairs, but we must hang up blinds. No one\\nknows how to do it; I must see to it myself,” answered Dolly addressing\\nhim.\\n\\n“God knows whether they are fully reconciled,” thought Anna, hearing\\nher tone, cold and composed.\\n\\n“Oh, nonsense, Dolly, always making difficulties,” answered her\\nhusband. “Come, I’ll do it all, if you like....”\\n\\n“Yes, they must be reconciled,” thought Anna.\\n\\n“I know how you do everything,” answered Dolly. “You tell Matvey to do\\nwhat can’t be done, and go away yourself, leaving him to make a muddle\\nof everything,” and her habitual, mocking smile curved the corners of\\nDolly’s lips as she spoke.\\n\\n“Full, full reconciliation, full,” thought Anna; “thank God!” and\\nrejoicing that she was the cause of it, she went up to Dolly and kissed\\nher.\\n\\n“Not at all. Why do you always look down on me and Matvey?” said Stepan\\nArkadyevitch, smiling hardly perceptibly, and addressing his wife.\\n\\nThe whole evening Dolly was, as always, a little mocking in her tone to\\nher husband, while Stepan Arkadyevitch was happy and cheerful, but not\\nso as to seem as though, having been forgiven, he had forgotten his\\noffense.\\n\\nAt half-past nine o’clock a particularly joyful and pleasant family\\nconversation over the tea-table at the Oblonskys’ was broken up by an\\napparently simple incident. But this simple incident for some reason\\nstruck everyone as strange. Talking about common acquaintances in\\nPetersburg, Anna got up quickly.\\n\\n“She is in my album,” she said; “and, by the way, I’ll show you my\\nSeryozha,” she added, with a mother’s smile of pride.\\n\\nTowards ten o’clock, when she usually said good-night to her son, and\\noften before going to a ball put him to bed herself, she felt depressed\\nat being so far from him; and whatever she was talking about, she kept\\ncoming back in thought to her curly-headed Seryozha. She longed to look\\nat his photograph and talk of him. Seizing the first pretext, she got\\nup, and with her light, resolute step went for her album. The stairs up\\nto her room came out on the landing of the great warm main staircase.\\n\\nJust as she was leaving the drawing-room, a ring was heard in the hall.\\n\\n“Who can that be?” said Dolly.\\n\\n“It’s early for me to be fetched, and for anyone else it’s late,”\\nobserved Kitty.\\n\\n“Sure to be someone with papers for me,” put in Stepan Arkadyevitch.\\nWhen Anna was passing the top of the staircase, a servant was running\\nup to announce the visitor, while the visitor himself was standing\\nunder a lamp. Anna glancing down at once recognized Vronsky, and a\\nstrange feeling of pleasure and at the same time of dread of something\\nstirred in her heart. He was standing still, not taking off his coat,\\npulling something out of his pocket. At the instant when she was just\\nfacing the stairs, he raised his eyes, caught sight of her, and into\\nthe expression of his face there passed a shade of embarrassment and\\ndismay. With a slight inclination of her head she passed, hearing\\nbehind her Stepan Arkadyevitch’s loud voice calling him to come up, and\\nthe quiet, soft, and composed voice of Vronsky refusing.\\n\\nWhen Anna returned with the album, he was already gone, and Stepan\\nArkadyevitch was telling them that he had called to inquire about the\\ndinner they were giving next day to a celebrity who had just arrived.\\n“And nothing would induce him to come up. What a queer fellow he is!”\\nadded Stepan Arkadyevitch.\\n\\nKitty blushed. She thought that she was the only person who knew why he\\nhad come, and why he would not come up. “He has been at home,” she\\nthought, “and didn’t find me, and thought I should be here, but he did\\nnot come up because he thought it late, and Anna’s here.”\\n\\nAll of them looked at each other, saying nothing, and began to look at\\nAnna’s album.\\n\\nThere was nothing either exceptional or strange in a man’s calling at\\nhalf-past nine on a friend to inquire details of a proposed dinner\\nparty and not coming in, but it seemed strange to all of them. Above\\nall, it seemed strange and not right to Anna 22\\n\\nThe ball was only just beginning as Kitty and her mother walked up the\\ngreat staircase, flooded with light, and lined with flowers and footmen\\nin powder and red coats. From the rooms came a constant, steady hum, as\\nfrom a hive, and the rustle of movement; and while on the landing\\nbetween trees they gave last touches to their hair and dresses before\\nthe mirror, they heard from the ballroom the careful, distinct notes of\\nthe fiddles of the orchestra beginning the first waltz. A little old\\nman in civilian dress, arranging his gray curls before another mirror,\\nand diffusing an odor of scent, stumbled against them on the stairs,\\nand stood aside, evidently admiring Kitty, whom he did not know. A\\nbeardless youth, one of those society youths whom the old Prince\\nShtcherbatsky called “young bucks,” in an exceedingly open waistcoat,\\nstraightening his white tie as he went, bowed to them, and after\\nrunning by, came back to ask Kitty for a quadrille. As the first\\nquadrille had already been given to Vronsky, she had to promise this\\nyouth the second. An officer, buttoning his glove, stood aside in the\\ndoorway, and stroking his mustache, admired rosy Kitty.\\n\\nAlthough her dress, her coiffure, and all the preparations for the ball\\nhad cost Kitty great trouble and consideration, at this moment she\\nwalked into the ballroom in her elaborate tulle dress over a pink slip\\nas easily and simply as though all the rosettes and lace, all the\\nminute details of her attire, had not cost her or her family a moment’s\\nattention, as though she had been born in that tulle and lace, with her\\nhair done up high on her head, and a rose and two leaves on the top of\\nit.\\n\\nWhen, just before entering the ballroom, the princess, her mother,\\ntried to turn right side out of the ribbon of her sash, Kitty had drawn\\nback a little. She felt that everything must be right of itself, and\\ngraceful, and nothing could need setting straight.\\n\\nIt was one of Kitty’s best days. Her dress was not uncomfortable\\nanywhere; her lace berthe did not droop anywhere; her rosettes were not\\ncrushed nor torn off; her pink slippers with high, hollowed-out heels\\ndid not pinch, but gladdened her feet; and the thick rolls of fair\\nchignon kept up on her head as if they were her own hair. All the three\\nbuttons buttoned up without tearing on the long glove that covered her\\nhand without concealing its lines. The black velvet of her locket\\nnestled with special softness round her neck. That velvet was\\ndelicious; at home, looking at her neck in the looking-glass, Kitty had\\nfelt that that velvet was speaking. About all the rest there might be a\\ndoubt, but the velvet was delicious. Kitty smiled here too, at the\\nball, when she glanced at it in the glass. Her bare shoulders and arms\\ngave Kitty a sense of chill marble, a feeling she particularly liked.\\nHer eyes sparkled, and her rosy lips could not keep from smiling from\\nthe consciousness of her own attractiveness. She had scarcely entered\\nthe ballroom and reached the throng of ladies, all tulle, ribbons,\\nlace, and flowers, waiting to be asked to dance—Kitty was never one of\\nthat throng—when she was asked for a waltz, and asked by the best\\npartner, the first star in the hierarchy of the ballroom, a renowned\\ndirector of dances, a married man, handsome and well-built, Yegorushka\\nKorsunsky. He had only just left the Countess Bonina, with whom he had\\ndanced the first half of the waltz, and, scanning his kingdom—that is\\nto say, a few couples who had started dancing—he caught sight of Kitty,\\nentering, and flew up to her with that peculiar, easy amble which is\\nconfined to directors of balls. Without even asking her if she cared to\\ndance, he put out his arm to encircle her slender waist. She looked\\nround for someone to give her fan to, and their hostess, smiling to\\nher, took it.\\n\\n“How nice you’ve come in good time,” he said to her, embracing her\\nwaist; “such a bad habit to be late.” Bending her left hand, she laid\\nit on his shoulder, and her little feet in their pink slippers began\\nswiftly, lightly, and rhythmically moving over the slippery floor in\\ntime to the music.\\n\\n“It’s a rest to waltz with you,” he said to her, as they fell into the\\nfirst slow steps of the waltz. “It’s exquisite—such lightness,\\nprecision.” He said to her the same thing he said to almost all his\\npartners whom he knew well.\\n\\nShe smiled at his praise, and continued to look about the room over his\\nshoulder. She was not like a girl at her first ball, for whom all faces\\nin the ballroom melt into one vision of fairyland. And she was not a\\ngirl who had gone the stale round of balls till every face in the\\nballroom was familiar and tiresome. But she was in the middle stage\\nbetween these two; she was excited, and at the same time she had\\nsufficient self-possession to be able to observe. In the left corner of\\nthe ballroom she saw the cream of society gathered together.\\nThere—incredibly naked—was the beauty Lidi, Korsunsky’s wife; there was\\nthe lady of the house; there shone the bald head of Krivin, always to\\nbe found where the best people were. In that direction gazed the young\\nmen, not venturing to approach. There, too, she descried Stiva, and\\nthere she saw the exquisite figure and head of Anna in a black velvet\\ngown. And _he_ was there. Kitty had not seen him since the evening she\\nrefused Levin. With her long-sighted eyes, she knew him at once, and\\nwas even aware that he was looking at her.\\n\\n“Another turn, eh? You’re not tired?” said Korsunsky, a little out of\\nbreath.\\n\\n“No, thank you!”\\n\\n“Where shall I take you?”\\n\\n“Madame Karenina’s here, I think ... take me to her.”\\n\\n“Wherever you command.”\\n\\nAnd Korsunsky began waltzing with measured steps straight towards the\\ngroup in the left corner, continually saying, “Pardon, mesdames,\\npardon, pardon, mesdames”; and steering his course through the sea of\\nlace, tulle, and ribbon, and not disarranging a feather, he turned his\\npartner sharply round, so that her slim ankles, in light transparent\\nstockings, were exposed to view, and her train floated out in fan shape\\nand covered Krivin’s knees. Korsunsky bowed, set straight his open\\nshirt front, and gave her his arm to conduct her to Anna Arkadyevna.\\nKitty, flushed, took her train from Krivin’s knees, and, a little\\ngiddy, looked round, seeking Anna. Anna was not in lilac, as Kitty had\\nso urgently wished, but in a black, low-cut, velvet gown, showing her\\nfull throat and shoulders, that looked as though carved in old ivory,\\nand her rounded arms, with tiny, slender wrists. The whole gown was\\ntrimmed with Venetian guipure. On her head, among her black hair—her\\nown, with no false additions—was a little wreath of pansies, and a\\nbouquet of the same in the black ribbon of her sash among white lace.\\nHer coiffure was not striking. All that was noticeable was the little\\nwilful tendrils of her curly hair that would always break free about\\nher neck and temples. Round her well-cut, strong neck was a thread of\\npearls.\\n\\nKitty had been seeing Anna every day; she adored her, and had pictured\\nher invariably in lilac. But now seeing her in black, she felt that she\\nhad not fully seen her charm. She saw her now as someone quite new and\\nsurprising to her. Now she understood that Anna could not have been in\\nlilac, and that her charm was just that she always stood out against\\nher attire, that her dress could never be noticeable on her. And her\\nblack dress, with its sumptuous lace, was not noticeable on her; it was\\nonly the frame, and all that was seen was she—simple, natural, elegant,\\nand at the same time gay and eager.\\n\\nShe was standing holding herself, as always, very erect, and when Kitty\\ndrew near the group she was speaking to the master of the house, her\\nhead slightly turned towards him.\\n\\n“No, I don’t throw stones,” she was saying, in answer to something,\\n“though I can’t understand it,” she went on, shrugging her shoulders,\\nand she turned at once with a soft smile of protection towards Kitty.\\nWith a flying, feminine glance she scanned her attire, and made a\\nmovement of her head, hardly perceptible, but understood by Kitty,\\nsignifying approval of her dress and her looks. “You came into the room\\ndancing,” she added.\\n\\n“This is one of my most faithful supporters,” said Korsunsky, bowing to\\nAnna Arkadyevna, whom he had not yet seen. “The princess helps to make\\nballs happy and successful. Anna Arkadyevna, a waltz?” he said, bending\\ndown to her.\\n\\n“Why, have you met?” inquired their host.\\n\\n“Is there anyone we have not met? My wife and I are like white\\nwolves—everyone knows us,” answered Korsunsky. “A waltz, Anna\\nArkadyevna?”\\n\\n“I don’t dance when it’s possible not to dance,” she said.\\n\\n“But tonight it’s impossible,” answered Korsunsky.\\n\\nAt that instant Vronsky came up.\\n\\n“Well, since it’s impossible tonight, let us start,” she said, not\\nnoticing Vronsky’s bow, and she hastily put her hand on Korsunsky’s\\nshoulder.\\n\\n“What is she vexed with him about?” thought Kitty, discerning that Anna\\nhad intentionally not responded to Vronsky’s bow. Vronsky went up to\\nKitty reminding her of the first quadrille, and expressing his regret\\nthat he had not seen her all this time. Kitty gazed in admiration at\\nAnna waltzing, and listened to him. She expected him to ask her for a\\nwaltz, but he did not, and she glanced wonderingly at him. He flushed\\nslightly, and hurriedly asked her to waltz, but he had only just put\\nhis arm round her waist and taken the first step when the music\\nsuddenly stopped. Kitty looked into his face, which was so close to her\\nown, and long afterwards—for several years after—that look, full of\\nlove, to which he made no response, cut her to the heart with an agony\\nof shame.\\n\\n“_Pardon! pardon!_ Waltz! waltz!” shouted Korsunsky from the other side\\nof the room, and seizing the first young lady he came across he began\\ndancing himself 23\\n\\nVronsky and Kitty waltzed several times round the room. After the first\\nwaltz Kitty went to her mother, and she had hardly time to say a few\\nwords to Countess Nordston when Vronsky came up again for the first\\nquadrille. During the quadrille nothing of any significance was said:\\nthere was disjointed talk between them of the Korsunskys, husband and\\nwife, whom he described very amusingly, as delightful children at\\nforty, and of the future town theater; and only once the conversation\\ntouched her to the quick, when he asked her about Levin, whether he was\\nhere, and added that he liked him so much. But Kitty did not expect\\nmuch from the quadrille. She looked forward with a thrill at her heart\\nto the mazurka. She fancied that in the mazurka everything must be\\ndecided. The fact that he did not during the quadrille ask her for the\\nmazurka did not trouble her. She felt sure she would dance the mazurka\\nwith him as she had done at former balls, and refused five young men,\\nsaying she was engaged for the mazurka. The whole ball up to the last\\nquadrille was for Kitty an enchanted vision of delightful colors,\\nsounds, and motions. She only sat down when she felt too tired and\\nbegged for a rest. But as she was dancing the last quadrille with one\\nof the tiresome young men whom she could not refuse, she chanced to be\\n_vis-à-vis_ with Vronsky and Anna. She had not been near Anna again\\nsince the beginning of the evening, and now again she saw her suddenly\\nquite new and surprising. She saw in her the signs of that excitement\\nof success she knew so well in herself; she saw that she was\\nintoxicated with the delighted admiration she was exciting. She knew\\nthat feeling and knew its signs, and saw them in Anna; saw the\\nquivering, flashing light in her eyes, and the smile of happiness and\\nexcitement unconsciously playing on her lips, and the deliberate grace,\\nprecision, and lightness of her movements.\\n\\n“Who?” she asked herself. “All or one?” And not assisting the harassed\\nyoung man she was dancing with in the conversation, the thread of which\\nhe had lost and could not pick up again, she obeyed with external\\nliveliness the peremptory shouts of Korsunsky starting them all into\\nthe _grand rond_, and then into the _chaîne_, and at the same time she\\nkept watch with a growing pang at her heart. “No, it’s not the\\nadmiration of the crowd has intoxicated her, but the adoration of one.\\nAnd that one? can it be he?” Every time he spoke to Anna the joyous\\nlight flashed into her eyes, and the smile of happiness curved her red\\nlips. She seemed to make an effort to control herself, to try not to\\nshow these signs of delight, but they came out on her face of\\nthemselves. “But what of him?” Kitty looked at him and was filled with\\nterror. What was pictured so clearly to Kitty in the mirror of Anna’s\\nface she saw in him. What had become of his always self-possessed\\nresolute manner, and the carelessly serene expression of his face? Now\\nevery time he turned to her, he bent his head, as though he would have\\nfallen at her feet, and in his eyes there was nothing but humble\\nsubmission and dread. “I would not offend you,” his eyes seemed every\\ntime to be saying, “but I want to save myself, and I don’t know how.”\\nOn his face was a look such as Kitty had never seen before.\\n\\nThey were speaking of common acquaintances, keeping up the most trivial\\nconversation, but to Kitty it seemed that every word they said was\\ndetermining their fate and hers. And strange it was that they were\\nactually talking of how absurd Ivan Ivanovitch was with his French, and\\nhow the Eletsky girl might have made a better match, yet these words\\nhad all the while consequence for them, and they were feeling just as\\nKitty did. The whole ball, the whole world, everything seemed lost in\\nfog in Kitty’s soul. Nothing but the stern discipline of her\\nbringing-up supported her and forced her to do what was expected of\\nher, that is, to dance, to answer questions, to talk, even to smile.\\nBut before the mazurka, when they were beginning to rearrange the\\nchairs and a few couples moved out of the smaller rooms into the big\\nroom, a moment of despair and horror came for Kitty. She had refused\\nfive partners, and now she was not dancing the mazurka. She had not\\neven a hope of being asked for it, because she was so successful in\\nsociety that the idea would never occur to anyone that she had remained\\ndisengaged till now. She would have to tell her mother she felt ill and\\ngo home, but she had not the strength to do this. She felt crushed. She\\nwent to the furthest end of the little drawing-room and sank into a low\\nchair. Her light, transparent skirts rose like a cloud about her\\nslender waist; one bare, thin, soft, girlish arm, hanging listlessly,\\nwas lost in the folds of her pink tunic; in the other she held her fan,\\nand with rapid, short strokes fanned her burning face. But while she\\nlooked like a butterfly, clinging to a blade of grass, and just about\\nto open its rainbow wings for fresh flight, her heart ached with a\\nhorrible despair.\\n\\n“But perhaps I am wrong, perhaps it was not so?” And again she recalled\\nall she had seen.\\n\\n“Kitty, what is it?” said Countess Nordston, stepping noiselessly over\\nthe carpet towards her. “I don’t understand it.”\\n\\nKitty’s lower lip began to quiver; she got up quickly.\\n\\n“Kitty, you’re not dancing the mazurka?”\\n\\n“No, no,” said Kitty in a voice shaking with tears.\\n\\n“He asked her for the mazurka before me,” said Countess Nordston,\\nknowing Kitty would understand who were “he” and “her.” “She said:\\n‘Why, aren’t you going to dance it with Princess Shtcherbatskaya?’”\\n\\n“Oh, I don’t care!” answered Kitty.\\n\\nNo one but she herself understood her position; no one knew that she\\nhad just refused the man whom perhaps she loved, and refused him\\nbecause she had put her faith in another.\\n\\nCountess Nordston found Korsunsky, with whom she was to dance the\\nmazurka, and told him to ask Kitty.\\n\\nKitty danced in the first couple, and luckily for her she had not to\\ntalk, because Korsunsky was all the time running about directing the\\nfigure. Vronsky and Anna sat almost opposite her. She saw them with her\\nlong-sighted eyes, and saw them, too, close by, when they met in the\\nfigures, and the more she saw of them the more convinced was she that\\nher unhappiness was complete. She saw that they felt themselves alone\\nin that crowded room. And on Vronsky’s face, always so firm and\\nindependent, she saw that look that had struck her, of bewilderment and\\nhumble submissiveness, like the expression of an intelligent dog when\\nit has done wrong.\\n\\nAnna smiled, and her smile was reflected by him. She grew thoughtful,\\nand he became serious. Some supernatural force drew Kitty’s eyes to\\nAnna’s face. She was fascinating in her simple black dress, fascinating\\nwere her round arms with their bracelets, fascinating was her firm neck\\nwith its thread of pearls, fascinating the straying curls of her loose\\nhair, fascinating the graceful, light movements of her little feet and\\nhands, fascinating was that lovely face in its eagerness, but there was\\nsomething terrible and cruel in her fascination.\\n\\nKitty admired her more than ever, and more and more acute was her\\nsuffering. Kitty felt overwhelmed, and her face showed it. When Vronsky\\nsaw her, coming across her in the mazurka, he did not at once recognize\\nher, she was so changed.\\n\\n“Delightful ball!” he said to her, for the sake of saying something.\\n\\n“Yes,” she answered.\\n\\nIn the middle of the mazurka, repeating a complicated figure, newly\\ninvented by Korsunsky, Anna came forward into the center of the circle,\\nchose two gentlemen, and summoned a lady and Kitty. Kitty gazed at her\\nin dismay as she went up. Anna looked at her with drooping eyelids, and\\nsmiled, pressing her hand. But, noticing that Kitty only responded to\\nher smile by a look of despair and amazement, she turned away from her,\\nand began gaily talking to the other lady.\\n\\n“Yes, there is something uncanny, devilish and fascinating in her,”\\nKitty said to herself.\\n\\nAnna did not mean to stay to supper, but the master of the house began\\nto press her to do so.\\n\\n“Nonsense, Anna Arkadyevna,” said Korsunsky, drawing her bare arm under\\nthe sleeve of his dress coat, “I’ve such an idea for a _cotillion! Un\\nbijou!_”\\n\\nAnd he moved gradually on, trying to draw her along with him. Their\\nhost smiled approvingly.\\n\\n“No, I am not going to stay,” answered Anna, smiling, but in spite of\\nher smile, both Korsunsky and the master of the house saw from her\\nresolute tone that she would not stay.\\n\\n“No; why, as it is, I have danced more at your ball in Moscow than I\\nhave all the winter in Petersburg,” said Anna, looking round at\\nVronsky, who stood near her. “I must rest a little before my journey.”\\n\\n“Are you certainly going tomorrow then?” asked Vronsky.\\n\\n“Yes, I suppose so,” answered Anna, as it were wondering at the\\nboldness of his question; but the irrepressible, quivering brilliance\\nof her eyes and her smile set him on fire as she said it.\\n\\nAnna Arkadyevna did not stay to supper, but went home 24\\n\\n“Yes, there is something in me hateful, repulsive,” thought Levin, as\\nhe came away from the Shtcherbatskys’, and walked in the direction of\\nhis brother’s lodgings. “And I don’t get on with other people. Pride,\\nthey say. No, I have no pride. If I had any pride, I should not have\\nput myself in such a position.” And he pictured to himself Vronsky,\\nhappy, good-natured, clever, and self-possessed, certainly never placed\\nin the awful position in which he had been that evening. “Yes, she was\\nbound to choose him. So it had to be, and I cannot complain of anyone\\nor anything. I am myself to blame. What right had I to imagine she\\nwould care to join her life to mine? Who am I and what am I? A nobody,\\nnot wanted by anyone, nor of use to anybody.” And he recalled his\\nbrother Nikolay, and dwelt with pleasure on the thought of him. “Isn’t\\nhe right that everything in the world is base and loathsome? And are we\\nfair in our judgment of brother Nikolay? Of course, from the point of\\nview of Prokofy, seeing him in a torn cloak and tipsy, he’s a\\ndespicable person. But I know him differently. I know his soul, and\\nknow that we are like him. And I, instead of going to seek him out,\\nwent out to dinner, and came here.” Levin walked up to a lamppost, read\\nhis brother’s address, which was in his pocketbook, and called a\\nsledge. All the long way to his brother’s, Levin vividly recalled all\\nthe facts familiar to him of his brother Nikolay’s life. He remembered\\nhow his brother, while at the university, and for a year afterwards,\\nhad, in spite of the jeers of his companions, lived like a monk,\\nstrictly observing all religious rites, services, and fasts, and\\navoiding every sort of pleasure, especially women. And afterwards, how\\nhe had all at once broken out: he had associated with the most horrible\\npeople, and rushed into the most senseless debauchery. He remembered\\nlater the scandal over a boy, whom he had taken from the country to\\nbring up, and, in a fit of rage, had so violently beaten that\\nproceedings were brought against him for unlawfully wounding. Then he\\nrecalled the scandal with a sharper, to whom he had lost money, and\\ngiven a promissory note, and against whom he had himself lodged a\\ncomplaint, asserting that he had cheated him. (This was the money\\nSergey Ivanovitch had paid.) Then he remembered how he had spent a\\nnight in the lockup for disorderly conduct in the street. He remembered\\nthe shameful proceedings he had tried to get up against his brother\\nSergey Ivanovitch, accusing him of not having paid him his share of his\\nmother’s fortune, and the last scandal, when he had gone to a western\\nprovince in an official capacity, and there had got into trouble for\\nassaulting a village elder.... It was all horribly disgusting, yet to\\nLevin it appeared not at all in the same disgusting light as it\\ninevitably would to those who did not know Nikolay, did not know all\\nhis story, did not know his heart.\\n\\nLevin remembered that when Nikolay had been in the devout stage, the\\nperiod of fasts and monks and church services, when he was seeking in\\nreligion a support and a curb for his passionate temperament, everyone,\\nfar from encouraging him, had jeered at him, and he, too, with the\\nothers. They had teased him, called him Noah, and monk; and, when he\\nhad broken out, no one had helped him, but everyone had turned away\\nfrom him with horror and disgust.\\n\\nLevin felt that, in spite of all the ugliness of his life, his brother\\nNikolay, in his soul, in the very depths of his soul, was no more in\\nthe wrong than the people who despised him. He was not to blame for\\nhaving been born with his unbridled temperament and his somehow limited\\nintelligence. But he had always wanted to be good. “I will tell him\\neverything, without reserve, and I will make him speak without reserve,\\ntoo, and I’ll show him that I love him, and so understand him,” Levin\\nresolved to himself, as, towards eleven o’clock, he reached the hotel\\nof which he had the address.\\n\\n“At the top, 12 and 13,” the porter answered Levin’s inquiry.\\n\\n“At home?”\\n\\n“Sure to be at home.”\\n\\nThe door of No. 12 was half open, and there came out into the streak of\\nlight thick fumes of cheap, poor tobacco, and the sound of a voice,\\nunknown to Levin; but he knew at once that his brother was there; he\\nheard his cough.\\n\\nAs he went in the door, the unknown voice was saying:\\n\\n“It all depends with how much judgment and knowledge the thing’s done.”\\n\\nKonstantin Levin looked in at the door, and saw that the speaker was a\\nyoung man with an immense shock of hair, wearing a Russian jerkin, and\\nthat a pockmarked woman in a woolen gown, without collar or cuffs, was\\nsitting on the sofa. His brother was not to be seen. Konstantin felt a\\nsharp pang at his heart at the thought of the strange company in which\\nhis brother spent his life. No one had heard him, and Konstantin,\\ntaking off his galoshes, listened to what the gentleman in the jerkin\\nwas saying. He was speaking of some enterprise.\\n\\n“Well, the devil flay them, the privileged classes,” his brother’s\\nvoice responded, with a cough. “Masha! get us some supper and some wine\\nif there’s any left; or else go and get some.”\\n\\nThe woman rose, came out from behind the screen, and saw Konstantin.\\n\\n“There’s some gentleman, Nikolay Dmitrievitch,” she said.\\n\\n“Whom do you want?” said the voice of Nikolay Levin, angrily.\\n\\n“It’s I,” answered Konstantin Levin, coming forward into the light.\\n\\n“Who’s _I_?” Nikolay’s voice said again, still more angrily. He could\\nbe heard getting up hurriedly, stumbling against something, and Levin\\nsaw, facing him in the doorway, the big, scared eyes, and the huge,\\nthin, stooping figure of his brother, so familiar, and yet astonishing\\nin its weirdness and sickliness.\\n\\nHe was even thinner than three years before, when Konstantin Levin had\\nseen him last. He was wearing a short coat, and his hands and big bones\\nseemed huger than ever. His hair had grown thinner, the same straight\\nmustaches hid his lips, the same eyes gazed strangely and naïvely at\\nhis visitor.\\n\\n“Ah, Kostya!” he exclaimed suddenly, recognizing his brother, and his\\neyes lit up with joy. But the same second he looked round at the young\\nman, and gave the nervous jerk of his head and neck that Konstantin\\nknew so well, as if his neckband hurt him; and a quite different\\nexpression, wild, suffering, and cruel, rested on his emaciated face.\\n\\n“I wrote to you and Sergey Ivanovitch both that I don’t know you and\\ndon’t want to know you. What is it you want?”\\n\\nHe was not at all the same as Konstantin had been fancying him. The\\nworst and most tiresome part of his character, what made all relations\\nwith him so difficult, had been forgotten by Konstantin Levin when he\\nthought of him, and now, when he saw his face, and especially that\\nnervous twitching of his head, he remembered it all.\\n\\n“I didn’t want to see you for anything,” he answered timidly. “I’ve\\nsimply come to see you.”\\n\\nHis brother’s timidity obviously softened Nikolay. His lips twitched.\\n\\n“Oh, so that’s it?” he said. “Well, come in; sit down. Like some\\nsupper? Masha, bring supper for three. No, stop a minute. Do you know\\nwho this is?” he said, addressing his brother, and indicating the\\ngentleman in the jerkin: “This is Mr. Kritsky, my friend from Kiev, a\\nvery remarkable man. He’s persecuted by the police, of course, because\\nhe’s not a scoundrel.”\\n\\nAnd he looked round in the way he always did at everyone in the room.\\nSeeing that the woman standing in the doorway was moving to go, he\\nshouted to her, “Wait a minute, I said.” And with the inability to\\nexpress himself, the incoherence that Konstantin knew so well, he\\nbegan, with another look round at everyone, to tell his brother\\nKritsky’s story: how he had been expelled from the university for\\nstarting a benefit society for the poor students and Sunday schools;\\nand how he had afterwards been a teacher in a peasant school, and how\\nhe had been driven out of that too, and had afterwards been condemned\\nfor something.\\n\\n“You’re of the Kiev university?” said Konstantin Levin to Kritsky, to\\nbreak the awkward silence that followed.\\n\\n“Yes, I was of Kiev,” Kritsky replied angrily, his face darkening.\\n\\n“And this woman,” Nikolay Levin interrupted him, pointing to her, “is\\nthe partner of my life, Marya Nikolaevna. I took her out of a bad\\nhouse,” and he jerked his neck saying this; “but I love her and respect\\nher, and anyone who wants to know me,” he added, raising his voice and\\nknitting his brows, “I beg to love her and respect her. She’s just the\\nsame as my wife, just the same. So now you know whom you’ve to do with.\\nAnd if you think you’re lowering yourself, well, here’s the floor,\\nthere’s the door.”\\n\\nAnd again his eyes traveled inquiringly over all of them.\\n\\n“Why I should be lowering myself, I don’t understand.”\\n\\n“Then, Masha, tell them to bring supper; three portions, spirits and\\nwine.... No, wait a minute.... No, it doesn’t matter.... Go along 25\\n\\n“So you see,” pursued Nikolay Levin, painfully wrinkling his forehead\\nand twitching.\\n\\nIt was obviously difficult for him to think of what to say and do.\\n\\n“Here, do you see?”... He pointed to some sort of iron bars, fastened\\ntogether with strings, lying in a corner of the room. “Do you see that?\\nThat’s the beginning of a new thing we’re going into. It’s a productive\\nassociation....”\\n\\nKonstantin scarcely heard him. He looked into his sickly, consumptive\\nface, and he was more and more sorry for him, and he could not force\\nhimself to listen to what his brother was telling him about the\\nassociation. He saw that this association was a mere anchor to save him\\nfrom self-contempt. Nikolay Levin went on talking:\\n\\n“You know that capital oppresses the laborer. The laborers with us, the\\npeasants, bear all the burden of labor, and are so placed that however\\nmuch they work they can’t escape from their position of beasts of\\nburden. All the profits of labor, on which they might improve their\\nposition, and gain leisure for themselves, and after that education,\\nall the surplus values are taken from them by the capitalists. And\\nsociety’s so constituted that the harder they work, the greater the\\nprofit of the merchants and landowners, while they stay beasts of\\nburden to the end. And that state of things must be changed,” he\\nfinished up, and he looked questioningly at his brother.\\n\\n“Yes, of course,” said Konstantin, looking at the patch of red that had\\ncome out on his brother’s projecting cheekbones.\\n\\n“And so we’re founding a locksmiths’ association, where all the\\nproduction and profit and the chief instruments of production will be\\nin common.”\\n\\n“Where is the association to be?” asked Konstantin Levin.\\n\\n“In the village of Vozdrem, Kazan government.”\\n\\n“But why in a village? In the villages, I think, there is plenty of\\nwork as it is. Why a locksmiths’ association in a village?”\\n\\n“Why? Because the peasants are just as much slaves as they ever were,\\nand that’s why you and Sergey Ivanovitch don’t like people to try and\\nget them out of their slavery,” said Nikolay Levin, exasperated by the\\nobjection.\\n\\nKonstantin Levin sighed, looking meanwhile about the cheerless and\\ndirty room. This sigh seemed to exasperate Nikolay still more.\\n\\n“I know your and Sergey Ivanovitch’s aristocratic views. I know that he\\napplies all the power of his intellect to justify existing evils.”\\n\\n“No; and what do you talk of Sergey Ivanovitch for?” said Levin,\\nsmiling.\\n\\n“Sergey Ivanovitch? I’ll tell you what for!” Nikolay Levin shrieked\\nsuddenly at the name of Sergey Ivanovitch. “I’ll tell you what for....\\nBut what’s the use of talking? There’s only one thing.... What did you\\ncome to me for? You look down on this, and you’re welcome to,—and go\\naway, in God’s name go away!” he shrieked, getting up from his chair.\\n“And go away, and go away!”\\n\\n“I don’t look down on it at all,” said Konstantin Levin timidly. “I\\ndon’t even dispute it.”\\n\\nAt that instant Marya Nikolaevna came back. Nikolay Levin looked round\\nangrily at her. She went quickly to him, and whispered something.\\n\\n“I’m not well; I’ve grown irritable,” said Nikolay Levin, getting\\ncalmer and breathing painfully; “and then you talk to me of Sergey\\nIvanovitch and his article. It’s such rubbish, such lying, such\\nself-deception. What can a man write of justice who knows nothing of\\nit? Have you read his article?” he asked Kritsky, sitting down again at\\nthe table, and moving back off half of it the scattered cigarettes, so\\nas to clear a space.\\n\\n“I’ve not read it,” Kritsky responded gloomily, obviously not desiring\\nto enter into the conversation.\\n\\n“Why not?” said Nikolay Levin, now turning with exasperation upon\\nKritsky.\\n\\n“Because I didn’t see the use of wasting my time over it.”\\n\\n“Oh, but excuse me, how did you know it would be wasting your time?\\nThat article’s too deep for many people—that’s to say it’s over their\\nheads. But with me, it’s another thing; I see through his ideas, and I\\nknow where its weakness lies.”\\n\\nEveryone was mute. Kritsky got up deliberately and reached his cap.\\n\\n“Won’t you have supper? All right, good-bye! Come round tomorrow with\\nthe locksmith.”\\n\\nKritsky had hardly gone out when Nikolay Levin smiled and winked.\\n\\n“He’s no good either,” he said. “I see, of course....”\\n\\nBut at that instant Kritsky, at the door, called him....\\n\\n“What do you want now?” he said, and went out to him in the passage.\\nLeft alone with Marya Nikolaevna, Levin turned to her.\\n\\n“Have you been long with my brother?” he said to her.\\n\\n“Yes, more than a year. Nikolay Dmitrievitch’s health has become very\\npoor. Nikolay Dmitrievitch drinks a great deal,” she said.\\n\\n“That is ... how does he drink?”\\n\\n“Drinks vodka, and it’s bad for him.”\\n\\n“And a great deal?” whispered Levin.\\n\\n“Yes,” she said, looking timidly towards the doorway, where Nikolay\\nLevin had reappeared.\\n\\n“What were you talking about?” he said, knitting his brows, and turning\\nhis scared eyes from one to the other. “What was it?”\\n\\n“Oh, nothing,” Konstantin answered in confusion.\\n\\n“Oh, if you don’t want to say, don’t. Only it’s no good your talking to\\nher. She’s a wench, and you’re a gentleman,” he said with a jerk of the\\nneck. “You understand everything, I see, and have taken stock of\\neverything, and look with commiseration on my shortcomings,” he began\\nagain, raising his voice.\\n\\n“Nikolay Dmitrievitch, Nikolay Dmitrievitch,” whispered Marya\\nNikolaevna, again going up to him.\\n\\n“Oh, very well, very well!... But where’s the supper? Ah, here it is,”\\nhe said, seeing a waiter with a tray. “Here, set it here,” he added\\nangrily, and promptly seizing the vodka, he poured out a glassful and\\ndrank it greedily. “Like a drink?” he turned to his brother, and at\\nonce became better humored.\\n\\n“Well, enough of Sergey Ivanovitch. I’m glad to see you, anyway. After\\nall’s said and done, we’re not strangers. Come, have a drink. Tell me\\nwhat you’re doing,” he went on, greedily munching a piece of bread, and\\npouring out another glassful. “How are you living?”\\n\\n“I live alone in the country, as I used to. I’m busy looking after the\\nland,” answered Konstantin, watching with horror the greediness with\\nwhich his brother ate and drank, and trying to conceal that he noticed\\nit.\\n\\n“Why don’t you get married?”\\n\\n“It hasn’t happened so,” Konstantin answered, reddening a little.\\n\\n“Why not? For me now ... everything’s at an end! I’ve made a mess of my\\nlife. But this I’ve said, and I say still, that if my share had been\\ngiven me when I needed it, my whole life would have been different.”\\n\\nKonstantin made haste to change the conversation.\\n\\n“Do you know your little Vanya’s with me, a clerk in the countinghouse\\nat Pokrovskoe.”\\n\\nNikolay jerked his neck, and sank into thought.\\n\\n“Yes, tell me what’s going on at Pokrovskoe. Is the house standing\\nstill, and the birch trees, and our schoolroom? And Philip the\\ngardener, is he living? How I remember the arbor and the seat! Now mind\\nand don’t alter anything in the house, but make haste and get married,\\nand make everything as it used to be again. Then I’ll come and see you,\\nif your wife is nice.”\\n\\n“But come to me now,” said Levin. “How nicely we would arrange it!”\\n\\n“I’d come and see you if I were sure I should not find Sergey\\nIvanovitch.”\\n\\n“You wouldn’t find him there. I live quite independently of him.”\\n\\n“Yes, but say what you like, you will have to choose between me and\\nhim,” he said, looking timidly into his brother’s face.\\n\\nThis timidity touched Konstantin.\\n\\n“If you want to hear my confession of faith on the subject, I tell you\\nthat in your quarrel with Sergey Ivanovitch I take neither side. You’re\\nboth wrong. You’re more wrong externally, and he inwardly.”\\n\\n“Ah, ah! You see that, you see that!” Nikolay shouted joyfully.\\n\\n“But I personally value friendly relations with you more because....”\\n\\n“Why, why?”\\n\\nKonstantin could not say that he valued it more because Nikolay was\\nunhappy, and needed affection. But Nikolay knew that this was just what\\nhe meant to say, and scowling he took up the vodka again.\\n\\n“Enough, Nikolay Dmitrievitch!” said Marya Nikolaevna, stretching out\\nher plump, bare arm towards the decanter.\\n\\n“Let it be! Don’t insist! I’ll beat you!” he shouted.\\n\\nMarya Nikolaevna smiled a sweet and good-humored smile, which was at\\nonce reflected on Nikolay’s face, and she took the bottle.\\n\\n“And do you suppose she understands nothing?” said Nikolay. “She\\nunderstands it all better than any of us. Isn’t it true there’s\\nsomething good and sweet in her?”\\n\\n“Were you never before in Moscow?” Konstantin said to her, for the sake\\nof saying something.\\n\\n“Only you mustn’t be polite and stiff with her. It frightens her. No\\none ever spoke to her so but the justices of the peace who tried her\\nfor trying to get out of a house of ill-fame. Mercy on us, the\\nsenselessness in the world!” he cried suddenly. “These new\\ninstitutions, these justices of the peace, rural councils, what\\nhideousness it all is!”\\n\\nAnd he began to enlarge on his encounters with the new institutions.\\n\\nKonstantin Levin heard him, and the disbelief in the sense of all\\npublic institutions, which he shared with him, and often expressed, was\\ndistasteful to him now from his brother’s lips.\\n\\n“In another world we shall understand it all,” he said lightly.\\n\\n“In another world! Ah, I don’t like that other world! I don’t like it,”\\nhe said, letting his scared eyes rest on his brother’s eyes. “Here one\\nwould think that to get out of all the baseness and the mess, one’s own\\nand other people’s, would be a good thing, and yet I’m afraid of death,\\nawfully afraid of death.” He shuddered. “But do drink something. Would\\nyou like some champagne? Or shall we go somewhere? Let’s go to the\\nGypsies! Do you know I have got so fond of the Gypsies and Russian\\nsongs.”\\n\\nHis speech had begun to falter, and he passed abruptly from one subject\\nto another. Konstantin with the help of Masha persuaded him not to go\\nout anywhere, and got him to bed hopelessly drunk.\\n\\nMasha promised to write to Konstantin in case of need, and to persuade\\nNikolay Levin to go and stay with his brother 26\\n\\nIn the morning Konstantin Levin left Moscow, and towards evening he\\nreached home. On the journey in the train he talked to his neighbors\\nabout politics and the new railways, and, just as in Moscow, he was\\novercome by a sense of confusion of ideas, dissatisfaction with\\nhimself, shame of something or other. But when he got out at his own\\nstation, when he saw his one-eyed coachman, Ignat, with the collar of\\nhis coat turned up; when, in the dim light reflected by the station\\nfires, he saw his own sledge, his own horses with their tails tied up,\\nin their harness trimmed with rings and tassels; when the coachman\\nIgnat, as he put in his luggage, told him the village news, that the\\ncontractor had arrived, and that Pava had calved,—he felt that little\\nby little the confusion was clearing up, and the shame and\\nself-dissatisfaction were passing away. He felt this at the mere sight\\nof Ignat and the horses; but when he had put on the sheepskin brought\\nfor him, had sat down wrapped up in the sledge, and had driven off\\npondering on the work that lay before him in the village, and staring\\nat the side-horse, that had been his saddle-horse, past his prime now,\\nbut a spirited beast from the Don, he began to see what had happened to\\nhim in quite a different light. He felt himself, and did not want to be\\nanyone else. All he wanted now was to be better than before. In the\\nfirst place he resolved that from that day he would give up hoping for\\nany extraordinary happiness, such as marriage must have given him, and\\nconsequently he would not so disdain what he really had. Secondly, he\\nwould never again let himself give way to low passion, the memory of\\nwhich had so tortured him when he had been making up his mind to make\\nan offer. Then remembering his brother Nikolay, he resolved to himself\\nthat he would never allow himself to forget him, that he would follow\\nhim up, and not lose sight of him, so as to be ready to help when\\nthings should go ill with him. And that would be soon, he felt. Then,\\ntoo, his brother’s talk of communism, which he had treated so lightly\\nat the time, now made him think. He considered a revolution in economic\\nconditions nonsense. But he always felt the injustice of his own\\nabundance in comparison with the poverty of the peasants, and now he\\ndetermined that so as to feel quite in the right, though he had worked\\nhard and lived by no means luxuriously before, he would now work still\\nharder, and would allow himself even less luxury. And all this seemed\\nto him so easy a conquest over himself that he spent the whole drive in\\nthe pleasantest daydreams. With a resolute feeling of hope in a new,\\nbetter life, he reached home before nine o’clock at night.\\n\\nThe snow of the little quadrangle before the house was lit up by a\\nlight in the bedroom windows of his old nurse, Agafea Mihalovna, who\\nperformed the duties of housekeeper in his house. She was not yet\\nasleep. Kouzma, waked up by her, came sidling sleepily out onto the\\nsteps. A setter bitch, Laska, ran out too, almost upsetting Kouzma, and\\nwhining, turned round about Levin’s knees, jumping up and longing, but\\nnot daring, to put her forepaws on his chest.\\n\\n“You’re soon back again, sir,” said Agafea Mihalovna.\\n\\n“I got tired of it, Agafea Mihalovna. With friends, one is well; but at\\nhome, one is better,” he answered, and went into his study.\\n\\nThe study was slowly lit up as the candle was brought in. The familiar\\ndetails came out: the stag’s horns, the bookshelves, the looking-glass,\\nthe stove with its ventilator, which had long wanted mending, his\\nfather’s sofa, a large table, on the table an open book, a broken\\nashtray, a manuscript book with his handwriting. As he saw all this,\\nthere came over him for an instant a doubt of the possibility of\\narranging the new life, of which he had been dreaming on the road. All\\nthese traces of his life seemed to clutch him, and to say to him: “No,\\nyou’re not going to get away from us, and you’re not going to be\\ndifferent, but you’re going to be the same as you’ve always been; with\\ndoubts, everlasting dissatisfaction with yourself, vain efforts to\\namend, and falls, and everlasting expectation, of a happiness which you\\nwon’t get, and which isn’t possible for you.”\\n\\nThis the things said to him, but another voice in his heart was telling\\nhim that he must not fall under the sway of the past, and that one can\\ndo anything with oneself. And hearing that voice, he went into the\\ncorner where stood his two heavy dumbbells, and began brandishing them\\nlike a gymnast, trying to restore his confident temper. There was a\\ncreak of steps at the door. He hastily put down the dumbbells.\\n\\nThe bailiff came in, and said everything, thank God, was doing well;\\nbut informed him that the buckwheat in the new drying machine had been\\na little scorched. This piece of news irritated Levin. The new drying\\nmachine had been constructed and partly invented by Levin. The bailiff\\nhad always been against the drying machine, and now it was with\\nsuppressed triumph that he announced that the buckwheat had been\\nscorched. Levin was firmly convinced that if the buckwheat had been\\nscorched, it was only because the precautions had not been taken, for\\nwhich he had hundreds of times given orders. He was annoyed, and\\nreprimanded the bailiff. But there had been an important and joyful\\nevent: Pava, his best cow, an expensive beast, bought at a show, had\\ncalved.\\n\\n“Kouzma, give me my sheepskin. And you tell them to take a lantern.\\nI’ll come and look at her,” he said to the bailiff.\\n\\nThe cowhouse for the more valuable cows was just behind the house.\\nWalking across the yard, passing a snowdrift by the lilac tree, he went\\ninto the cowhouse. There was the warm, steamy smell of dung when the\\nfrozen door was opened, and the cows, astonished at the unfamiliar\\nlight of the lantern, stirred on the fresh straw. He caught a glimpse\\nof the broad, smooth, black and piebald back of Hollandka. Berkoot, the\\nbull, was lying down with his ring in his lip, and seemed about to get\\nup, but thought better of it, and only gave two snorts as they passed\\nby him. Pava, a perfect beauty, huge as a hippopotamus, with her back\\nturned to them, prevented their seeing the calf, as she sniffed her all\\nover.\\n\\nLevin went into the pen, looked Pava over, and lifted the red and\\nspotted calf onto her long, tottering legs. Pava, uneasy, began lowing,\\nbut when Levin put the calf close to her she was soothed, and, sighing\\nheavily, began licking her with her rough tongue. The calf, fumbling,\\npoked her nose under her mother’s udder, and stiffened her tail out\\nstraight.\\n\\n“Here, bring the light, Fyodor, this way,” said Levin, examining the\\ncalf. “Like the mother! though the color takes after the father; but\\nthat’s nothing. Very good. Long and broad in the haunch. Vassily\\nFedorovitch, isn’t she splendid?” he said to the bailiff, quite\\nforgiving him for the buckwheat under the influence of his delight in\\nthe calf.\\n\\n“How could she fail to be? Oh, Semyon the contractor came the day after\\nyou left. You must settle with him, Konstantin Dmitrievitch,” said the\\nbailiff. “I did inform you about the machine.”\\n\\nThis question was enough to take Levin back to all the details of his\\nwork on the estate, which was on a large scale, and complicated. He\\nwent straight from the cowhouse to the counting house, and after a\\nlittle conversation with the bailiff and Semyon the contractor, he went\\nback to the house and straight upstairs to the drawing-room 27\\n\\nThe house was big and old-fashioned, and Levin, though he lived alone,\\nhad the whole house heated and used. He knew that this was stupid, he\\nknew that it was positively not right, and contrary to his present new\\nplans, but this house was a whole world to Levin. It was the world in\\nwhich his father and mother had lived and died. They had lived just the\\nlife that to Levin seemed the ideal of perfection, and that he had\\ndreamed of beginning with his wife, his family.\\n\\nLevin scarcely remembered his mother. His conception of her was for him\\na sacred memory, and his future wife was bound to be in his imagination\\na repetition of that exquisite, holy ideal of a woman that his mother\\nhad been.\\n\\nHe was so far from conceiving of love for woman apart from marriage\\nthat he positively pictured to himself first the family, and only\\nsecondarily the woman who would give him a family. His ideas of\\nmarriage were, consequently, quite unlike those of the great majority\\nof his acquaintances, for whom getting married was one of the numerous\\nfacts of social life. For Levin it was the chief affair of life, on\\nwhich its whole happiness turned. And now he had to give up that.\\n\\nWhen he had gone into the little drawing-room, where he always had tea,\\nand had settled himself in his armchair with a book, and Agafea\\nMihalovna had brought him tea, and with her usual, “Well, I’ll stay a\\nwhile, sir,” had taken a chair in the window, he felt that, however\\nstrange it might be, he had not parted from his daydreams, and that he\\ncould not live without them. Whether with her, or with another, still\\nit would be. He was reading a book, and thinking of what he was\\nreading, and stopping to listen to Agafea Mihalovna, who gossiped away\\nwithout flagging, and yet with all that, all sorts of pictures of\\nfamily life and work in the future rose disconnectedly before his\\nimagination. He felt that in the depth of his soul something had been\\nput in its place, settled down, and laid to rest.\\n\\nHe heard Agafea Mihalovna talking of how Prohor had forgotten his duty\\nto God, and with the money Levin had given him to buy a horse, had been\\ndrinking without stopping, and had beaten his wife till he’d half\\nkilled her. He listened, and read his book, and recalled the whole\\ntrain of ideas suggested by his reading. It was Tyndall’s _Treatise on\\nHeat_. He recalled his own criticisms of Tyndall of his complacent\\nsatisfaction in the cleverness of his experiments, and for his lack of\\nphilosophic insight. And suddenly there floated into his mind the\\njoyful thought: “In two years’ time I shall have two Dutch cows; Pava\\nherself will perhaps still be alive, a dozen young daughters of Berkoot\\nand the three others—how lovely!”\\n\\nHe took up his book again. “Very good, electricity and heat are the\\nsame thing; but is it possible to substitute the one quantity for the\\nother in the equation for the solution of any problem? No. Well, then\\nwhat of it? The connection between all the forces of nature is felt\\ninstinctively.... It’s particulary nice if Pava’s daughter should be a\\nred-spotted cow, and all the herd will take after her, and the other\\nthree, too! Splendid! To go out with my wife and visitors to meet the\\nherd.... My wife says, ‘Kostya and I looked after that calf like a\\nchild.’ ‘How can it interest you so much?’ says a visitor. ‘Everything\\nthat interests him, interests me.’ But who will she be?” And he\\nremembered what had happened at Moscow.... “Well, there’s nothing to be\\ndone.... It’s not my fault. But now everything shall go on in a new\\nway. It’s nonsense to pretend that life won’t let one, that the past\\nwon’t let one. One must struggle to live better, much better.”... He\\nraised his head, and fell to dreaming. Old Laska, who had not yet fully\\ndigested her delight at his return, and had run out into the yard to\\nbark, came back wagging her tail, and crept up to him, bringing in the\\nscent of fresh air, put her head under his hand, and whined\\nplaintively, asking to be stroked.\\n\\n“There, who’d have thought it?” said Agafea Mihalovna. “The dog now ...\\nwhy, she understands that her master’s come home, and that he’s\\nlow-spirited.”\\n\\n“Why low-spirited?”\\n\\n“Do you suppose I don’t see it, sir? It’s high time I should know the\\ngentry. Why, I’ve grown up from a little thing with them. It’s nothing,\\nsir, so long as there’s health and a clear conscience.”\\n\\nLevin looked intently at her, surprised at how well she knew his\\nthought.\\n\\n“Shall I fetch you another cup?” said she, and taking his cup she went\\nout.\\n\\nLaska kept poking her head under his hand. He stroked her, and she\\npromptly curled up at his feet, laying her head on a hindpaw. And in\\ntoken of all now being well and satisfactory, she opened her mouth a\\nlittle, smacked her lips, and settling her sticky lips more comfortably\\nabout her old teeth, she sank into blissful repose. Levin watched all\\nher movements attentively.\\n\\n“That’s what I’ll do,” he said to himself; “that’s what I’ll do!\\nNothing’s amiss.... All’s well 28\\n\\nAfter the ball, early next morning, Anna Arkadyevna sent her husband a\\ntelegram that she was leaving Moscow the same day.\\n\\n“No, I must go, I must go”; she explained to her sister-in-law the\\nchange in her plans in a tone that suggested that she had to remember\\nso many things that there was no enumerating them: “no, it had really\\nbetter be today!”\\n\\nStepan Arkadyevitch was not dining at home, but he promised to come and\\nsee his sister off at seven o’clock.\\n\\nKitty, too, did not come, sending a note that she had a headache. Dolly\\nand Anna dined alone with the children and the English governess.\\nWhether it was that the children were fickle, or that they had acute\\nsenses, and felt that Anna was quite different that day from what she\\nhad been when they had taken such a fancy to her, that she was not now\\ninterested in them,—but they had abruptly dropped their play with their\\naunt, and their love for her, and were quite indifferent that she was\\ngoing away. Anna was absorbed the whole morning in preparations for her\\ndeparture. She wrote notes to her Moscow acquaintances, put down her\\naccounts, and packed. Altogether Dolly fancied she was not in a placid\\nstate of mind, but in that worried mood, which Dolly knew well with\\nherself, and which does not come without cause, and for the most part\\ncovers dissatisfaction with self. After dinner, Anna went up to her\\nroom to dress, and Dolly followed her.\\n\\n“How queer you are today!” Dolly said to her.\\n\\n“I? Do you think so? I’m not queer, but I’m nasty. I am like that\\nsometimes. I keep feeling as if I could cry. It’s very stupid, but\\nit’ll pass off,” said Anna quickly, and she bent her flushed face over\\na tiny bag in which she was packing a nightcap and some cambric\\nhandkerchiefs. Her eyes were particularly bright, and were continually\\nswimming with tears. “In the same way I didn’t want to leave\\nPetersburg, and now I don’t want to go away from here.”\\n\\n“You came here and did a good deed,” said Dolly, looking intently at\\nher.\\n\\nAnna looked at her with eyes wet with tears.\\n\\n“Don’t say that, Dolly. I’ve done nothing, and could do nothing. I\\noften wonder why people are all in league to spoil me. What have I\\ndone, and what could I do? In your heart there was found love enough to\\nforgive....”\\n\\n“If it had not been for you, God knows what would have happened! How\\nhappy you are, Anna!” said Dolly. “Everything is clear and good in your\\nheart.”\\n\\n“Every heart has its own _skeletons_, as the English say.”\\n\\n“You have no sort of _skeleton_, have you? Everything is so clear in\\nyou.”\\n\\n“I have!” said Anna suddenly, and, unexpectedly after her tears, a sly,\\nironical smile curved her lips.\\n\\n“Come, he’s amusing, anyway, your _skeleton_, and not depressing,” said\\nDolly, smiling.\\n\\n“No, he’s depressing. Do you know why I’m going today instead of\\ntomorrow? It’s a confession that weighs on me; I want to make it to\\nyou,” said Anna, letting herself drop definitely into an armchair, and\\nlooking straight into Dolly’s face.\\n\\nAnd to her surprise Dolly saw that Anna was blushing up to her ears, up\\nto the curly black ringlets on her neck.\\n\\n“Yes,” Anna went on. “Do you know why Kitty didn’t come to dinner?\\nShe’s jealous of me. I have spoiled ... I’ve been the cause of that\\nball being a torture to her instead of a pleasure. But truly, truly,\\nit’s not my fault, or only my fault a little bit,” she said, daintily\\ndrawling the words “a little bit.”\\n\\n“Oh, how like Stiva you said that!” said Dolly, laughing.\\n\\nAnna was hurt.\\n\\n“Oh no, oh no! I’m not Stiva,” she said, knitting her brows. “That’s\\nwhy I’m telling you, just because I could never let myself doubt myself\\nfor an instant,” said Anna.\\n\\nBut at the very moment she was uttering the words, she felt that they\\nwere not true. She was not merely doubting herself, she felt emotion at\\nthe thought of Vronsky, and was going away sooner than she had meant,\\nsimply to avoid meeting him.\\n\\n“Yes, Stiva told me you danced the mazurka with him, and that he....”\\n\\n“You can’t imagine how absurdly it all came about. I only meant to be\\nmatchmaking, and all at once it turned out quite differently. Possibly\\nagainst my own will....”\\n\\nShe crimsoned and stopped.\\n\\n“Oh, they feel it directly?” said Dolly.\\n\\n“But I should be in despair if there were anything serious in it on his\\nside,” Anna interrupted her. “And I am certain it will all be\\nforgotten, and Kitty will leave off hating me.”\\n\\n“All the same, Anna, to tell you the truth, I’m not very anxious for\\nthis marriage for Kitty. And it’s better it should come to nothing, if\\nhe, Vronsky, is capable of falling in love with you in a single day.”\\n\\n“Oh, heavens, that would be too silly!” said Anna, and again a deep\\nflush of pleasure came out on her face, when she heard the idea, that\\nabsorbed her, put into words. “And so here I am going away, having made\\nan enemy of Kitty, whom I liked so much! Ah, how sweet she is! But\\nyou’ll make it right, Dolly? Eh?”\\n\\nDolly could scarcely suppress a smile. She loved Anna, but she enjoyed\\nseeing that she too had her weaknesses.\\n\\n“An enemy? That can’t be.”\\n\\n“I did so want you all to care for me, as I do for you, and now I care\\nfor you more than ever,” said Anna, with tears in her eyes. “Ah, how\\nsilly I am today!”\\n\\nShe passed her handkerchief over her face and began dressing.\\n\\nAt the very moment of starting Stepan Arkadyevitch arrived, late, rosy\\nand good-humored, smelling of wine and cigars.\\n\\nAnna’s emotionalism infected Dolly, and when she embraced her\\nsister-in-law for the last time, she whispered: “Remember, Anna, what\\nyou’ve done for me—I shall never forget. And remember that I love you,\\nand shall always love you as my dearest friend!”\\n\\n“I don’t know why,” said Anna, kissing her and hiding her tears.\\n\\n“You understood me, and you understand. Good-bye, my darling 29\\n\\n“Come, it’s all over, and thank God!” was the first thought that came\\nto Anna Arkadyevna, when she had said good-bye for the last time to her\\nbrother, who had stood blocking up the entrance to the carriage till\\nthe third bell rang. She sat down on her lounge beside Annushka, and\\nlooked about her in the twilight of the sleeping-carriage. “Thank God!\\ntomorrow I shall see Seryozha and Alexey Alexandrovitch, and my life\\nwill go on in the old way, all nice and as usual.”\\n\\nStill in the same anxious frame of mind, as she had been all that day,\\nAnna took pleasure in arranging herself for the journey with great\\ncare. With her little deft hands she opened and shut her little red\\nbag, took out a cushion, laid it on her knees, and carefully wrapping\\nup her feet, settled herself comfortably. An invalid lady had already\\nlain down to sleep. Two other ladies began talking to Anna, and a stout\\nelderly lady tucked up her feet, and made observations about the\\nheating of the train. Anna answered a few words, but not foreseeing any\\nentertainment from the conversation, she asked Annushka to get a lamp,\\nhooked it onto the arm of her seat, and took from her bag a paper-knife\\nand an English novel. At first her reading made no progress. The fuss\\nand bustle were disturbing; then when the train had started, she could\\nnot help listening to the noises; then the snow beating on the left\\nwindow and sticking to the pane, and the sight of the muffled guard\\npassing by, covered with snow on one side, and the conversations about\\nthe terrible snowstorm raging outside, distracted her attention.\\nFarther on, it was continually the same again and again: the same\\nshaking and rattling, the same snow on the window, the same rapid\\ntransitions from steaming heat to cold, and back again to heat, the\\nsame passing glimpses of the same figures in the twilight, and the same\\nvoices, and Anna began to read and to understand what she read.\\nAnnushka was already dozing, the red bag on her lap, clutched by her\\nbroad hands, in gloves, of which one was torn. Anna Arkadyevna read and\\nunderstood, but it was distasteful to her to read, that is, to follow\\nthe reflection of other people’s lives. She had too great a desire to\\nlive herself. If she read that the heroine of the novel was nursing a\\nsick man, she longed to move with noiseless steps about the room of a\\nsick man; if she read of a member of Parliament making a speech, she\\nlonged to be delivering the speech; if she read of how Lady Mary had\\nridden after the hounds, and had provoked her sister-in-law, and had\\nsurprised everyone by her boldness, she too wished to be doing the\\nsame. But there was no chance of doing anything; and twisting the\\nsmooth paper-knife in her little hands, she forced herself to read.\\n\\nThe hero of the novel was already almost reaching his English\\nhappiness, a baronetcy and an estate, and Anna was feeling a desire to\\ngo with him to the estate, when she suddenly felt that _he_ ought to\\nfeel ashamed, and that she was ashamed of the same thing. But what had\\nhe to be ashamed of? “What have I to be ashamed of?” she asked herself\\nin injured surprise. She laid down the book and sank against the back\\nof the chair, tightly gripping the paper-cutter in both hands. There\\nwas nothing. She went over all her Moscow recollections. All were good,\\npleasant. She remembered the ball, remembered Vronsky and his face of\\nslavish adoration, remembered all her conduct with him: there was\\nnothing shameful. And for all that, at the same point in her memories,\\nthe feeling of shame was intensified, as though some inner voice, just\\nat the point when she thought of Vronsky, were saying to her, “Warm,\\nvery warm, hot.” “Well, what is it?” she said to herself resolutely,\\nshifting her seat in the lounge. “What does it mean? Am I afraid to\\nlook it straight in the face? Why, what is it? Can it be that between\\nme and this officer boy there exist, or can exist, any other relations\\nthan such as are common with every acquaintance?” She laughed\\ncontemptuously and took up her book again; but now she was definitely\\nunable to follow what she read. She passed the paper-knife over the\\nwindow pane, then laid its smooth, cool surface to her cheek, and\\nalmost laughed aloud at the feeling of delight that all at once without\\ncause came over her. She felt as though her nerves were strings being\\nstrained tighter and tighter on some sort of screwing peg. She felt her\\neyes opening wider and wider, her fingers and toes twitching nervously,\\nsomething within oppressing her breathing, while all shapes and sounds\\nseemed in the uncertain half-light to strike her with unaccustomed\\nvividness. Moments of doubt were continually coming upon her, when she\\nwas uncertain whether the train were going forwards or backwards, or\\nwere standing still altogether; whether it were Annushka at her side or\\na stranger. “What’s that on the arm of the chair, a fur cloak or some\\nbeast? And what am I myself? Myself or some other woman?” She was\\nafraid of giving way to this delirium. But something drew her towards\\nit, and she could yield to it or resist it at will. She got up to rouse\\nherself, and slipped off her plaid and the cape of her warm dress. For\\na moment she regained her self-possession, and realized that the thin\\npeasant who had come in wearing a long overcoat, with buttons missing\\nfrom it, was the stoveheater, that he was looking at the thermometer,\\nthat it was the wind and snow bursting in after him at the door; but\\nthen everything grew blurred again.... That peasant with the long waist\\nseemed to be gnawing something on the wall, the old lady began\\nstretching her legs the whole length of the carriage, and filling it\\nwith a black cloud; then there was a fearful shrieking and banging, as\\nthough someone were being torn to pieces; then there was a blinding\\ndazzle of red fire before her eyes and a wall seemed to rise up and\\nhide everything. Anna felt as though she were sinking down. But it was\\nnot terrible, but delightful. The voice of a man muffled up and covered\\nwith snow shouted something in her ear. She got up and pulled herself\\ntogether; she realized that they had reached a station and that this\\nwas the guard. She asked Annushka to hand her the cape she had taken\\noff and her shawl, put them on and moved towards the door.\\n\\n“Do you wish to get out?” asked Annushka.\\n\\n“Yes, I want a little air. It’s very hot in here.” And she opened the\\ndoor. The driving snow and the wind rushed to meet her and struggled\\nwith her over the door. But she enjoyed the struggle.\\n\\nShe opened the door and went out. The wind seemed as though lying in\\nwait for her; with gleeful whistle it tried to snatch her up and bear\\nher off, but she clung to the cold door post, and holding her skirt got\\ndown onto the platform and under the shelter of the carriages. The wind\\nhad been powerful on the steps, but on the platform, under the lee of\\nthe carriages, there was a lull. With enjoyment she drew deep breaths\\nof the frozen, snowy air, and standing near the carriage looked about\\nthe platform and the lighted station 30\\n\\nThe raging tempest rushed whistling between the wheels of the\\ncarriages, about the scaffolding, and round the corner of the station.\\nThe carriages, posts, people, everything that was to be seen was\\ncovered with snow on one side, and was getting more and more thickly\\ncovered. For a moment there would come a lull in the storm, but then it\\nwould swoop down again with such onslaughts that it seemed impossible\\nto stand against it. Meanwhile men ran to and fro, talking merrily\\ntogether, their steps crackling on the platform as they continually\\nopened and closed the big doors. The bent shadow of a man glided by at\\nher feet, and she heard sounds of a hammer upon iron. “Hand over that\\ntelegram!” came an angry voice out of the stormy darkness on the other\\nside. “This way! No. 28!” several different voices shouted again, and\\nmuffled figures ran by covered with snow. Two gentlemen with lighted\\ncigarettes passed by her. She drew one more deep breath of the fresh\\nair, and had just put her hand out of her muff to take hold of the door\\npost and get back into the carriage, when another man in a military\\novercoat, quite close beside her, stepped between her and the\\nflickering light of the lamp post. She looked round, and the same\\ninstant recognized Vronsky’s face. Putting his hand to the peak of his\\ncap, he bowed to her and asked, Was there anything she wanted? Could he\\nbe of any service to her? She gazed rather a long while at him without\\nanswering, and, in spite of the shadow in which he was standing, she\\nsaw, or fancied she saw, both the expression of his face and his eyes.\\nIt was again that expression of reverential ecstasy which had so worked\\nupon her the day before. More than once she had told herself during the\\npast few days, and again only a few moments before, that Vronsky was\\nfor her only one of the hundreds of young men, forever exactly the\\nsame, that are met everywhere, that she would never allow herself to\\nbestow a thought upon him. But now at the first instant of meeting him,\\nshe was seized by a feeling of joyful pride. She had no need to ask why\\nhe had come. She knew as certainly as if he had told her that he was\\nhere to be where she was.\\n\\n“I didn’t know you were going. What are you coming for?” she said,\\nletting fall the hand with which she had grasped the door post. And\\nirrepressible delight and eagerness shone in her face.\\n\\n“What am I coming for?” he repeated, looking straight into her eyes.\\n“You know that I have come to be where you are,” he said; “I can’t help\\nit.”\\n\\nAt that moment the wind, as it were, surmounting all obstacles, sent\\nthe snow flying from the carriage roofs, and clanked some sheet of iron\\nit had torn off, while the hoarse whistle of the engine roared in\\nfront, plaintively and gloomily. All the awfulness of the storm seemed\\nto her more splendid now. He had said what her soul longed to hear,\\nthough she feared it with her reason. She made no answer, and in her\\nface he saw conflict.\\n\\n“Forgive me, if you dislike what I said,” he said humbly.\\n\\nHe had spoken courteously, deferentially, yet so firmly, so stubbornly,\\nthat for a long while she could make no answer.\\n\\n“It’s wrong, what you say, and I beg you, if you’re a good man, to\\nforget what you’ve said, as I forget it,” she said at last.\\n\\n“Not one word, not one gesture of yours shall I, could I, ever\\nforget....”\\n\\n“Enough, enough!” she cried trying assiduously to give a stern\\nexpression to her face, into which he was gazing greedily. And\\nclutching at the cold door post, she clambered up the steps and got\\nrapidly into the corridor of the carriage. But in the little corridor\\nshe paused, going over in her imagination what had happened. Though she\\ncould not recall her own words or his, she realized instinctively that\\nthe momentary conversation had brought them fearfully closer; and she\\nwas panic-stricken and blissful at it. After standing still a few\\nseconds, she went into the carriage and sat down in her place. The\\noverstrained condition which had tormented her before did not only come\\nback, but was intensified, and reached such a pitch that she was afraid\\nevery minute that something would snap within her from the excessive\\ntension. She did not sleep all night. But in that nervous tension, and\\nin the visions that filled her imagination, there was nothing\\ndisagreeable or gloomy: on the contrary there was something blissful,\\nglowing, and exhilarating. Towards morning Anna sank into a doze,\\nsitting in her place, and when she waked it was daylight and the train\\nwas near Petersburg. At once thoughts of home, of husband and of son,\\nand the details of that day and the following came upon her.\\n\\nAt Petersburg, as soon as the train stopped and she got out, the first\\nperson that attracted her attention was her husband. “Oh, mercy! why do\\nhis ears look like that?” she thought, looking at his frigid and\\nimposing figure, and especially the ears that struck her at the moment\\nas propping up the brim of his round hat. Catching sight of her, he\\ncame to meet her, his lips falling into their habitual sarcastic smile,\\nand his big, tired eyes looking straight at her. An unpleasant\\nsensation gripped at her heart when she met his obstinate and weary\\nglance, as though she had expected to see him different. She was\\nespecially struck by the feeling of dissatisfaction with herself that\\nshe experienced on meeting him. That feeling was an intimate, familiar\\nfeeling, like a consciousness of hypocrisy, which she experienced in\\nher relations with her husband. But hitherto she had not taken note of\\nthe feeling, now she was clearly and painfully aware of it.\\n\\n“Yes, as you see, your tender spouse, as devoted as the first year\\nafter marriage, burned with impatience to see you,” he said in his\\ndeliberate, high-pitched voice, and in that tone which he almost always\\ntook with her, a tone of jeering at anyone who should say in earnest\\nwhat he said.\\n\\n“Is Seryozha quite well?” she asked.\\n\\n“And is this all the reward,” said he, “for my ardor? He’s quite\\nwell 31\\n\\nVronsky had not even tried to sleep all that night. He sat in his\\narmchair, looking straight before him or scanning the people who got in\\nand out. If he had indeed on previous occasions struck and impressed\\npeople who did not know him by his air of unhesitating composure, he\\nseemed now more haughty and self-possessed than ever. He looked at\\npeople as if they were things. A nervous young man, a clerk in a law\\ncourt, sitting opposite him, hated him for that look. The young man\\nasked him for a light, and entered into conversation with him, and even\\npushed against him, to make him feel that he was not a thing, but a\\nperson. But Vronsky gazed at him exactly as he did at the lamp, and the\\nyoung man made a wry face, feeling that he was losing his\\nself-possession under the oppression of this refusal to recognize him\\nas a person.\\n\\nVronsky saw nothing and no one. He felt himself a king, not because he\\nbelieved that he had made an impression on Anna—he did not yet believe\\nthat,—but because the impression she had made on him gave him happiness\\nand pride.\\n\\nWhat would come of it all he did not know, he did not even think. He\\nfelt that all his forces, hitherto dissipated, wasted, were centered on\\none thing, and bent with fearful energy on one blissful goal. And he\\nwas happy at it. He knew only that he had told her the truth, that he\\nhad come where she was, that all the happiness of his life, the only\\nmeaning in life for him, now lay in seeing and hearing her. And when he\\ngot out of the carriage at Bologova to get some seltzer water, and\\ncaught sight of Anna, involuntarily his first word had told her just\\nwhat he thought. And he was glad he had told her it, that she knew it\\nnow and was thinking of it. He did not sleep all night. When he was\\nback in the carriage, he kept unceasingly going over every position in\\nwhich he had seen her, every word she had uttered, and before his\\nfancy, making his heart faint with emotion, floated pictures of a\\npossible future.\\n\\nWhen he got out of the train at Petersburg, he felt after his sleepless\\nnight as keen and fresh as after a cold bath. He paused near his\\ncompartment, waiting for her to get out. “Once more,” he said to\\nhimself, smiling unconsciously, “once more I shall see her walk, her\\nface; she will say something, turn her head, glance, smile, maybe.” But\\nbefore he caught sight of her, he saw her husband, whom the\\nstation-master was deferentially escorting through the crowd. “Ah, yes!\\nThe husband.” Only now for the first time did Vronsky realize clearly\\nthe fact that there was a person attached to her, a husband. He knew\\nthat she had a husband, but had hardly believed in his existence, and\\nonly now fully believed in him, with his head and shoulders, and his\\nlegs clad in black trousers; especially when he saw this husband calmly\\ntake her arm with a sense of property.\\n\\nSeeing Alexey Alexandrovitch with his Petersburg face and severely\\nself-confident figure, in his round hat, with his rather prominent\\nspine, he believed in him, and was aware of a disagreeable sensation,\\nsuch as a man might feel tortured by thirst, who, on reaching a spring,\\nshould find a dog, a sheep, or a pig, who has drunk of it and muddied\\nthe water. Alexey Alexandrovitch’s manner of walking, with a swing of\\nthe hips and flat feet, particularly annoyed Vronsky. He could\\nrecognize in no one but himself an indubitable right to love her. But\\nshe was still the same, and the sight of her affected him the same way,\\nphysically reviving him, stirring him, and filling his soul with\\nrapture. He told his German valet, who ran up to him from the second\\nclass, to take his things and go on, and he himself went up to her. He\\nsaw the first meeting between the husband and wife, and noted with a\\nlover’s insight the signs of slight reserve with which she spoke to her\\nhusband. “No, she does not love him and cannot love him,” he decided to\\nhimself.\\n\\nAt the moment when he was approaching Anna Arkadyevna he noticed too\\nwith joy that she was conscious of his being near, and looked round,\\nand seeing him, turned again to her husband.\\n\\n“Have you passed a good night?” he asked, bowing to her and her husband\\ntogether, and leaving it up to Alexey Alexandrovitch to accept the bow\\non his own account, and to recognize it or not, as he might see fit.\\n\\n“Thank you, very good,” she answered.\\n\\nHer face looked weary, and there was not that play of eagerness in it,\\npeeping out in her smile and her eyes; but for a single instant, as she\\nglanced at him, there was a flash of something in her eyes, and\\nalthough the flash died away at once, he was happy for that moment. She\\nglanced at her husband to find out whether he knew Vronsky. Alexey\\nAlexandrovitch looked at Vronsky with displeasure, vaguely recalling\\nwho this was. Vronsky’s composure and self-confidence here struck, like\\na scythe against a stone, upon the cold self-confidence of Alexey\\nAlexandrovitch.\\n\\n“Count Vronsky,” said Anna.\\n\\n“Ah! We are acquainted, I believe,” said Alexey Alexandrovitch\\nindifferently, giving his hand.\\n\\n“You set off with the mother and you return with the son,” he said,\\narticulating each syllable, as though each were a separate favor he was\\nbestowing.\\n\\n“You’re back from leave, I suppose?” he said, and without waiting for a\\nreply, he turned to his wife in his jesting tone: “Well, were a great\\nmany tears shed at Moscow at parting?”\\n\\nBy addressing his wife like this he gave Vronsky to understand that he\\nwished to be left alone, and, turning slightly towards him, he touched\\nhis hat; but Vronsky turned to Anna Arkadyevna.\\n\\n“I hope I may have the honor of calling on you,” he said.\\n\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch glanced with his weary eyes at Vronsky.\\n\\n“Delighted,” he said coldly. “On Mondays we’re at home. Most\\nfortunate,” he said to his wife, dismissing Vronsky altogether, “that I\\nshould just have half an hour to meet you, so that I can prove my\\ndevotion,” he went on in the same jesting tone.\\n\\n“You lay too much stress on your devotion for me to value it much,” she\\nresponded in the same jesting tone, involuntarily listening to the\\nsound of Vronsky’s steps behind them. “But what has it to do with me?”\\nshe said to herself, and she began asking her husband how Seryozha had\\ngot on without her.\\n\\n“Oh, capitally! Mariette says he has been very good, And ... I must\\ndisappoint you ... but he has not missed you as your husband has. But\\nonce more _merci,_ my dear, for giving me a day. Our dear _Samovar_\\nwill be delighted.” (He used to call the Countess Lidia Ivanovna, well\\nknown in society, a samovar, because she was always bubbling over with\\nexcitement.) “She has been continually asking after you. And, do you\\nknow, if I may venture to advise you, you should go and see her today.\\nYou know how she takes everything to heart. Just now, with all her own\\ncares, she’s anxious about the Oblonskys being brought together.”\\n\\nThe Countess Lidia Ivanovna was a friend of her husband’s, and the\\ncenter of that one of the coteries of the Petersburg world with which\\nAnna was, through her husband, in the closest relations.\\n\\n“But you know I wrote to her?”\\n\\n“Still she’ll want to hear details. Go and see her, if you’re not too\\ntired, my dear. Well, Kondraty will take you in the carriage, while I\\ngo to my committee. I shall not be alone at dinner again,” Alexey\\nAlexandrovitch went on, no longer in a sarcastic tone. “You wouldn’t\\nbelieve how I’ve missed....” And with a long pressure of her hand and a\\nmeaning smile, he put her in her carriage 32\\n\\nThe first person to meet Anna at home was her son. He dashed down the\\nstairs to her, in spite of the governess’s call, and with desperate joy\\nshrieked: “Mother! mother!” Running up to her, he hung on her neck.\\n\\n“I told you it was mother!” he shouted to the governess. “I knew!”\\n\\nAnd her son, like her husband, aroused in Anna a feeling akin to\\ndisappointment. She had imagined him better than he was in reality. She\\nhad to let herself drop down to the reality to enjoy him as he really\\nwas. But even as he was, he was charming, with his fair curls, his blue\\neyes, and his plump, graceful little legs in tightly pulled-up\\nstockings. Anna experienced almost physical pleasure in the sensation\\nof his nearness, and his caresses, and moral soothing, when she met his\\nsimple, confiding, and loving glance, and heard his naïve questions.\\nAnna took out the presents Dolly’s children had sent him, and told her\\nson what sort of little girl was Tanya at Moscow, and how Tanya could\\nread, and even taught the other children.\\n\\n“Why, am I not so nice as she?” asked Seryozha.\\n\\n“To me you’re nicer than anyone in the world.”\\n\\n“I know that,” said Seryozha, smiling.\\n\\nAnna had not had time to drink her coffee when the Countess Lidia\\nIvanovna was announced. The Countess Lidia Ivanovna was a tall, stout\\nwoman, with an unhealthily sallow face and splendid, pensive black\\neyes. Anna liked her, but today she seemed to be seeing her for the\\nfirst time with all her defects.\\n\\n“Well, my dear, so you took the olive branch?” inquired Countess Lidia\\nIvanovna, as soon as she came into the room.\\n\\n“Yes, it’s all over, but it was all much less serious than we had\\nsupposed,” answered Anna. “My _belle-sœur_ is in general too hasty.”\\n\\nBut Countess Lidia Ivanovna, though she was interested in everything\\nthat did not concern her, had a habit of never listening to what\\ninterested her; she interrupted Anna:\\n\\n“Yes, there’s plenty of sorrow and evil in the world. I am so worried\\ntoday.”\\n\\n“Oh, why?” asked Anna, trying to suppress a smile.\\n\\n“I’m beginning to be weary of fruitlessly championing the truth, and\\nsometimes I’m quite unhinged by it. The Society of the Little Sisters”\\n(this was a religiously-patriotic, philanthropic institution) “was\\ngoing splendidly, but with these gentlemen it’s impossible to do\\nanything,” added Countess Lidia Ivanovna in a tone of ironical\\nsubmission to destiny. “They pounce on the idea, and distort it, and\\nthen work it out so pettily and unworthily. Two or three people, your\\nhusband among them, understand all the importance of the thing, but the\\nothers simply drag it down. Yesterday Pravdin wrote to me....”\\n\\nPravdin was a well-known Panslavist abroad, and Countess Lidia Ivanovna\\ndescribed the purport of his letter.\\n\\nThen the countess told her of more disagreements and intrigues against\\nthe work of the unification of the churches, and departed in haste, as\\nshe had that day to be at the meeting of some society and also at the\\nSlavonic committee.\\n\\n“It was all the same before, of course; but why was it I didn’t notice\\nit before?” Anna asked herself. “Or has she been very much irritated\\ntoday? It’s really ludicrous; her object is doing good; she a\\nChristian, yet she’s always angry; and she always has enemies, and\\nalways enemies in the name of Christianity and doing good.”\\n\\nAfter Countess Lidia Ivanovna another friend came, the wife of a chief\\nsecretary, who told her all the news of the town. At three o’clock she\\ntoo went away, promising to come to dinner. Alexey Alexandrovitch was\\nat the ministry. Anna, left alone, spent the time till dinner in\\nassisting at her son’s dinner (he dined apart from his parents) and in\\nputting her things in order, and in reading and answering the notes and\\nletters which had accumulated on her table.\\n\\nThe feeling of causeless shame, which she had felt on the journey, and\\nher excitement, too, had completely vanished. In the habitual\\nconditions of her life she felt again resolute and irreproachable.\\n\\nShe recalled with wonder her state of mind on the previous day. “What\\nwas it? Nothing. Vronsky said something silly, which it was easy to put\\na stop to, and I answered as I ought to have done. To speak of it to my\\nhusband would be unnecessary and out of the question. To speak of it\\nwould be to attach importance to what has no importance.” She\\nremembered how she had told her husband of what was almost a\\ndeclaration made her at Petersburg by a young man, one of her husband’s\\nsubordinates, and how Alexey Alexandrovitch had answered that every\\nwoman living in the world was exposed to such incidents, but that he\\nhad the fullest confidence in her tact, and could never lower her and\\nhimself by jealousy. “So then there’s no reason to speak of it? And\\nindeed, thank God, there’s nothing to speak of,” she told herself 33\\n\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch came back from the meeting of the ministers at\\nfour o’clock, but as often happened, he had not time to come in to her.\\nHe went into his study to see the people waiting for him with\\npetitions, and to sign some papers brought him by his chief secretary.\\nAt dinner time (there were always a few people dining with the\\nKarenins) there arrived an old lady, a cousin of Alexey Alexandrovitch,\\nthe chief secretary of the department and his wife, and a young man who\\nhad been recommended to Alexey Alexandrovitch for the service. Anna\\nwent into the drawing-room to receive these guests. Precisely at five\\no’clock, before the bronze Peter the First clock had struck the fifth\\nstroke, Alexey Alexandrovitch came in, wearing a white tie and evening\\ncoat with two stars, as he had to go out directly after dinner. Every\\nminute of Alexey Alexandrovitch’s life was portioned out and occupied.\\nAnd to make time to get through all that lay before him every day, he\\nadhered to the strictest punctuality. “Unhasting and unresting,” was\\nhis motto. He came into the dining hall, greeted everyone, and\\nhurriedly sat down, smiling to his wife.\\n\\n“Yes, my solitude is over. You wouldn’t believe how uncomfortable” (he\\nlaid stress on the word _uncomfortable_) “it is to dine alone.”\\n\\nAt dinner he talked a little to his wife about Moscow matters, and,\\nwith a sarcastic smile, asked her after Stepan Arkadyevitch; but the\\nconversation was for the most part general, dealing with Petersburg\\nofficial and public news. After dinner he spent half an hour with his\\nguests, and again, with a smile, pressed his wife’s hand, withdrew, and\\ndrove off to the council. Anna did not go out that evening either to\\nthe Princess Betsy Tverskaya, who, hearing of her return, had invited\\nher, nor to the theater, where she had a box for that evening. She did\\nnot go out principally because the dress she had reckoned upon was not\\nready. Altogether, Anna, on turning, after the departure of her guests,\\nto the consideration of her attire, was very much annoyed. She was\\ngenerally a mistress of the art of dressing well without great expense,\\nand before leaving Moscow she had given her dressmaker three dresses to\\ntransform. The dresses had to be altered so that they could not be\\nrecognized, and they ought to have been ready three days before. It\\nappeared that two dresses had not been done at all, while the other one\\nhad not been altered as Anna had intended. The dressmaker came to\\nexplain, declaring that it would be better as she had done it, and Anna\\nwas so furious that she felt ashamed when she thought of it afterwards.\\nTo regain her serenity completely she went into the nursery, and spent\\nthe whole evening with her son, put him to bed herself, signed him with\\nthe cross, and tucked him up. She was glad she had not gone out\\nanywhere, and had spent the evening so well. She felt so light-hearted\\nand serene, she saw so clearly that all that had seemed to her so\\nimportant on her railway journey was only one of the common trivial\\nincidents of fashionable life, and that she had no reason to feel\\nashamed before anyone else or before herself. Anna sat down at the\\nhearth with an English novel and waited for her husband. Exactly at\\nhalf-past nine she heard his ring, and he came into the room.\\n\\n“Here you are at last!” she observed, holding out her hand to him.\\n\\nHe kissed her hand and sat down beside her.\\n\\n“Altogether then, I see your visit was a success,” he said to her.\\n\\n“Oh, yes,” she said, and she began telling him about everything from\\nthe beginning: her journey with Countess Vronskaya, her arrival, the\\naccident at the station. Then she described the pity she had felt,\\nfirst for her brother, and afterwards for Dolly.\\n\\n“I imagine one cannot exonerate such a man from blame, though he is\\nyour brother,” said Alexey Alexandrovitch severely.\\n\\nAnna smiled. She knew that he said that simply to show that family\\nconsiderations could not prevent him from expressing his genuine\\nopinion. She knew that characteristic in her husband, and liked it.\\n\\n“I am glad it has all ended so satisfactorily, and that you are back\\nagain,” he went on. “Come, what do they say about the new act I have\\ngot passed in the council?”\\n\\nAnna had heard nothing of this act, and she felt conscience-stricken at\\nhaving been able so readily to forget what was to him of such\\nimportance.\\n\\n“Here, on the other hand, it has made a great sensation,” he said, with\\na complacent smile.\\n\\nShe saw that Alexey Alexandrovitch wanted to tell her something\\npleasant to him about it, and she brought him by questions to telling\\nit. With the same complacent smile he told her of the ovations he had\\nreceived in consequence of the act he had passed.\\n\\n“I was very, very glad. It shows that at last a reasonable and steady\\nview of the matter is becoming prevalent among us.”\\n\\nHaving drunk his second cup of tea with cream, and bread, Alexey\\nAlexandrovitch got up, and was going towards his study.\\n\\n“And you’ve not been anywhere this evening? You’ve been dull, I\\nexpect?” he said.\\n\\n“Oh, no!” she answered, getting up after him and accompanying him\\nacross the room to his study. “What are you reading now?” she asked.\\n\\n“Just now I’m reading Duc de Lille, _Poésie des Enfers,_” he answered.\\n“A very remarkable book.”\\n\\nAnna smiled, as people smile at the weaknesses of those they love, and,\\nputting her hand under his, she escorted him to the door of the study.\\nShe knew his habit, that had grown into a necessity, of reading in the\\nevening. She knew, too, that in spite of his official duties, which\\nswallowed up almost the whole of his time, he considered it his duty to\\nkeep up with everything of note that appeared in the intellectual\\nworld. She knew, too, that he was really interested in books dealing\\nwith politics, philosophy, and theology, that art was utterly foreign\\nto his nature; but, in spite of this, or rather, in consequence of it,\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch never passed over anything in the world of art,\\nbut made it his duty to read everything. She knew that in politics, in\\nphilosophy, in theology, Alexey Alexandrovitch often had doubts, and\\nmade investigations; but on questions of art and poetry, and, above\\nall, of music, of which he was totally devoid of understanding, he had\\nthe most distinct and decided opinions. He was fond of talking about\\nShakespeare, Raphael, Beethoven, of the significance of new schools of\\npoetry and music, all of which were classified by him with very\\nconspicuous consistency.\\n\\n“Well, God be with you,” she said at the door of the study, where a\\nshaded candle and a decanter of water were already put by his armchair.\\n“And I’ll write to Moscow.”\\n\\nHe pressed her hand, and again kissed it.\\n\\n“All the same he’s a good man; truthful, good-hearted, and remarkable\\nin his own line,” Anna said to herself going back to her room, as\\nthough she were defending him to someone who had attacked him and said\\nthat one could not love him. “But why is it his ears stick out so\\nstrangely? Or has he had his hair cut?”\\n\\nPrecisely at twelve o’clock, when Anna was still sitting at her\\nwriting-table, finishing a letter to Dolly, she heard the sound of\\nmeasured steps in slippers, and Alexey Alexandrovitch, freshly washed\\nand combed, with a book under his arm, came in to her.\\n\\n“It’s time, it’s time,” said he, with a meaning smile, and he went into\\ntheir bedroom.\\n\\n“And what right had he to look at him like that?” thought Anna,\\nrecalling Vronsky’s glance at Alexey Alexandrovitch.\\n\\nUndressing, she went into the bedroom; but her face had none of the\\neagerness which, during her stay in Moscow, had fairly flashed from her\\neyes and her smile; on the contrary, now the fire seemed quenched in\\nher, hidden somewhere far away 34\\n\\nWhen Vronsky went to Moscow from Petersburg, he had left his large set\\nof rooms in Morskaia to his friend and favorite comrade Petritsky.\\n\\nPetritsky was a young lieutenant, not particularly well-connected, and\\nnot merely not wealthy, but always hopelessly in debt. Towards evening\\nhe was always drunk, and he had often been locked up after all sorts of\\nludicrous and disgraceful scandals, but he was a favorite both of his\\ncomrades and his superior officers. On arriving at twelve o’clock from\\nthe station at his flat, Vronsky saw, at the outer door, a hired\\ncarriage familiar to him. While still outside his own door, as he rang,\\nhe heard masculine laughter, the lisp of a feminine voice, and\\nPetritsky’s voice. “If that’s one of the villains, don’t let him in!”\\nVronsky told the servant not to announce him, and slipped quietly into\\nthe first room. Baroness Shilton, a friend of Petritsky’s, with a rosy\\nlittle face and flaxen hair, resplendent in a lilac satin gown, and\\nfilling the whole room, like a canary, with her Parisian chatter, sat\\nat the round table making coffee. Petritsky, in his overcoat, and the\\ncavalry captain Kamerovsky, in full uniform, probably just come from\\nduty, were sitting each side of her.\\n\\n“Bravo! Vronsky!” shouted Petritsky, jumping up, scraping his chair.\\n“Our host himself! Baroness, some coffee for him out of the new coffee\\npot. Why, we didn’t expect you! Hope you’re satisfied with the ornament\\nof your study,” he said, indicating the baroness. “You know each other,\\nof course?”\\n\\n“I should think so,” said Vronsky, with a bright smile, pressing the\\nbaroness’s little hand. “What next! I’m an old friend.”\\n\\n“You’re home after a journey,” said the baroness, “so I’m flying. Oh,\\nI’ll be off this minute, if I’m in the way.”\\n\\n“You’re home, wherever you are, baroness,” said Vronsky. “How do you\\ndo, Kamerovsky?” he added, coldly shaking hands with Kamerovsky.\\n\\n“There, you never know how to say such pretty things,” said the\\nbaroness, turning to Petritsky.\\n\\n“No; what’s that for? After dinner I say things quite as good.”\\n\\n“After dinner there’s no credit in them? Well, then, I’ll make you some\\ncoffee, so go and wash and get ready,” said the baroness, sitting down\\nagain, and anxiously turning the screw in the new coffee pot. “Pierre,\\ngive me the coffee,” she said, addressing Petritsky, whom she called\\nPierre as a contraction of his surname, making no secret of her\\nrelations with him. “I’ll put it in.”\\n\\n“You’ll spoil it!”\\n\\n“No, I won’t spoil it! Well, and your wife?” said the baroness\\nsuddenly, interrupting Vronsky’s conversation with his comrade. “We’ve\\nbeen marrying you here. Have you brought your wife?”\\n\\n“No, baroness. I was born a Bohemian, and a Bohemian I shall die.”\\n\\n“So much the better, so much the better. Shake hands on it.”\\n\\nAnd the baroness, detaining Vronsky, began telling him, with many\\njokes, about her last new plans of life, asking his advice.\\n\\n“He persists in refusing to give me a divorce! Well, what am I to do?”\\n(_He_ was her husband.) “Now I want to begin a suit against him. What\\ndo you advise? Kamerovsky, look after the coffee; it’s boiling over.\\nYou see, I’m engrossed with business! I want a lawsuit, because I must\\nhave my property. Do you understand the folly of it, that on the\\npretext of my being unfaithful to him,” she said contemptuously, “he\\nwants to get the benefit of my fortune.”\\n\\nVronsky heard with pleasure this light-hearted prattle of a pretty\\nwoman, agreed with her, gave her half-joking counsel, and altogether\\ndropped at once into the tone habitual to him in talking to such women.\\nIn his Petersburg world all people were divided into utterly opposed\\nclasses. One, the lower class, vulgar, stupid, and, above all,\\nridiculous people, who believe that one husband ought to live with the\\none wife whom he has lawfully married; that a girl should be innocent,\\na woman modest, and a man manly, self-controlled, and strong; that one\\nought to bring up one’s children, earn one’s bread, and pay one’s\\ndebts; and various similar absurdities. This was the class of\\nold-fashioned and ridiculous people. But there was another class of\\npeople, the real people. To this class they all belonged, and in it the\\ngreat thing was to be elegant, generous, plucky, gay, to abandon\\noneself without a blush to every passion, and to laugh at everything\\nelse.\\n\\nFor the first moment only, Vronsky was startled after the impression of\\na quite different world that he had brought with him from Moscow. But\\nimmediately as though slipping his feet into old slippers, he dropped\\nback into the light-hearted, pleasant world he had always lived in.\\n\\nThe coffee was never really made, but spluttered over everyone, and\\nboiled away, doing just what was required of it—that is, providing much\\ncause for much noise and laughter, and spoiling a costly rug and the\\nbaroness’s gown.\\n\\n“Well now, good-bye, or you’ll never get washed, and I shall have on my\\nconscience the worst sin a gentleman can commit. So you would advise a\\nknife to his throat?”\\n\\n“To be sure, and manage that your hand may not be far from his lips.\\nHe’ll kiss your hand, and all will end satisfactorily,” answered\\nVronsky.\\n\\n“So at the Français!” and, with a rustle of her skirts, she vanished.\\n\\nKamerovsky got up too, and Vronsky, not waiting for him to go, shook\\nhands and went off to his dressing-room.\\n\\nWhile he was washing, Petritsky described to him in brief outlines his\\nposition, as far as it had changed since Vronsky had left Petersburg.\\nNo money at all. His father said he wouldn’t give him any and pay his\\ndebts. His tailor was trying to get him locked up, and another fellow,\\ntoo, was threatening to get him locked up. The colonel of the regiment\\nhad announced that if these scandals did not cease he would have to\\nleave. As for the baroness, he was sick to death of her, especially\\nsince she’d taken to offering continually to lend him money. But he had\\nfound a girl—he’d show her to Vronsky—a marvel, exquisite, in the\\nstrict Oriental style, “genre of the slave Rebecca, don’t you know.”\\nHe’d had a row, too, with Berkoshov, and was going to send seconds to\\nhim, but of course it would come to nothing. Altogether everything was\\nsupremely amusing and jolly. And, not letting his comrade enter into\\nfurther details of his position, Petritsky proceeded to tell him all\\nthe interesting news. As he listened to Petritsky’s familiar stories in\\nthe familiar setting of the rooms he had spent the last three years in,\\nVronsky felt a delightful sense of coming back to the careless\\nPetersburg life that he was used to.\\n\\n“Impossible!” he cried, letting down the pedal of the washing basin in\\nwhich he had been sousing his healthy red neck. “Impossible!” he cried,\\nat the news that Laura had flung over Fertinghof and had made up to\\nMileev. “And is he as stupid and pleased as ever? Well, and how’s\\nBuzulukov?”\\n\\n“Oh, there is a tale about Buzulukov—simply lovely!” cried Petritsky.\\n“You know his weakness for balls, and he never misses a single court\\nball. He went to a big ball in a new helmet. Have you seen the new\\nhelmets? Very nice, lighter. Well, so he’s standing.... No, I say, do\\nlisten.”\\n\\n“I am listening,” answered Vronsky, rubbing himself with a rough towel.\\n\\n“Up comes the Grand Duchess with some ambassador or other, and, as\\nill-luck would have it, she begins talking to him about the new\\nhelmets. The Grand Duchess positively wanted to show the new helmet to\\nthe ambassador. They see our friend standing there.” (Petritsky\\nmimicked how he was standing with the helmet.) “The Grand Duchess asked\\nhim to give her the helmet; he doesn’t give it to her. What do you\\nthink of that? Well, everyone’s winking at him, nodding, frowning—give\\nit to her, do! He doesn’t give it to her. He’s mute as a fish. Only\\npicture it!... Well, the ... what’s his name, whatever he was ... tries\\nto take the helmet from him ... he won’t give it up!... He pulls it\\nfrom him, and hands it to the Grand Duchess. ‘Here, your Highness,’\\nsays he, ‘is the new helmet.’ She turned the helmet the other side up,\\nAnd—just picture it!—plop went a pear and sweetmeats out of it, two\\npounds of sweetmeats!... He’d been storing them up, the darling!”\\n\\nVronsky burst into roars of laughter. And long afterwards, when he was\\ntalking of other things, he broke out into his healthy laugh, showing\\nhis strong, close rows of teeth, when he thought of the helmet.\\n\\nHaving heard all the news, Vronsky, with the assistance of his valet,\\ngot into his uniform, and went off to report himself. He intended, when\\nhe had done that, to drive to his brother’s and to Betsy’s and to pay\\nseveral visits with a view to beginning to go into that society where\\nhe might meet Madame Karenina. As he always did in Petersburg, he left\\nhome not meaning to return till late at night.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPART TWO 1\\n\\nAt the end of the winter, in the Shtcherbatskys’ house, a consultation\\nwas being held, which was to pronounce on the state of Kitty’s health\\nand the measures to be taken to restore her failing strength. She had\\nbeen ill, and as spring came on she grew worse. The family doctor gave\\nher cod liver oil, then iron, then nitrate of silver, but as the first\\nand the second and the third were alike in doing no good, and as his\\nadvice when spring came was to go abroad, a celebrated physician was\\ncalled in. The celebrated physician, a very handsome man, still\\nyoungish, asked to examine the patient. He maintained, with peculiar\\nsatisfaction, it seemed, that maiden modesty is a mere relic of\\nbarbarism, and that nothing could be more natural than for a man still\\nyoungish to handle a young girl naked. He thought it natural because he\\ndid it every day, and felt and thought, as it seemed to him, no harm as\\nhe did it and consequently he considered modesty in the girl not merely\\nas a relic of barbarism, but also as an insult to himself.\\n\\nThere was nothing for it but to submit, since, although all the doctors\\nhad studied in the same school, had read the same books, and learned\\nthe same science, and though some people said this celebrated doctor\\nwas a bad doctor, in the princess’s household and circle it was for\\nsome reason accepted that this celebrated doctor alone had some special\\nknowledge, and that he alone could save Kitty. After a careful\\nexamination and sounding of the bewildered patient, dazed with shame,\\nthe celebrated doctor, having scrupulously washed his hands, was\\nstanding in the drawing-room talking to the prince. The prince frowned\\nand coughed, listening to the doctor. As a man who had seen something\\nof life, and neither a fool nor an invalid, he had no faith in\\nmedicine, and in his heart was furious at the whole farce, specially as\\nhe was perhaps the only one who fully comprehended the cause of Kitty’s\\nillness. “Conceited blockhead!” he thought, as he listened to the\\ncelebrated doctor’s chatter about his daughter’s symptoms. The doctor\\nwas meantime with difficulty restraining the expression of his contempt\\nfor this old gentleman, and with difficulty condescending to the level\\nof his intelligence. He perceived that it was no good talking to the\\nold man, and that the principal person in the house was the mother.\\nBefore her he decided to scatter his pearls. At that instant the\\nprincess came into the drawing-room with the family doctor. The prince\\nwithdrew, trying not to show how ridiculous he thought the whole\\nperformance. The princess was distracted, and did not know what to do.\\nShe felt she had sinned against Kitty.\\n\\n“Well, doctor, decide our fate,” said the princess. “Tell me\\neverything.”\\n\\n“Is there hope?” she meant to say, but her lips quivered, and she could\\nnot utter the question. “Well, doctor?”\\n\\n“Immediately, princess. I will talk it over with my colleague, and then\\nI will have the honor of laying my opinion before you.”\\n\\n“So we had better leave you?”\\n\\n“As you please.”\\n\\nThe princess went out with a sigh.\\n\\nWhen the doctors were left alone, the family doctor began timidly\\nexplaining his opinion, that there was a commencement of tuberculous\\ntrouble, but ... and so on. The celebrated doctor listened to him, and\\nin the middle of his sentence looked at his big gold watch.\\n\\n“Yes,” said he. “But....”\\n\\nThe family doctor respectfully ceased in the middle of his\\nobservations.\\n\\n“The commencement of the tuberculous process we are not, as you are\\naware, able to define; till there are cavities, there is nothing\\ndefinite. But we may suspect it. And there are indications;\\nmalnutrition, nervous excitability, and so on. The question stands\\nthus: in presence of indications of tuberculous process, what is to be\\ndone to maintain nutrition?”\\n\\n“But, you know, there are always moral, spiritual causes at the back in\\nthese cases,” the family doctor permitted himself to interpolate with a\\nsubtle smile.\\n\\n“Yes, that’s an understood thing,” responded the celebrated physician,\\nagain glancing at his watch. “Beg pardon, is the Yausky bridge done\\nyet, or shall I have to drive around?” he asked. “Ah! it is. Oh, well,\\nthen I can do it in twenty minutes. So we were saying the problem may\\nbe put thus: to maintain nutrition and to give tone to the nerves. The\\none is in close connection with the other, one must attack both sides\\nat once.”\\n\\n“And how about a tour abroad?” asked the family doctor.\\n\\n“I’ve no liking for foreign tours. And take note: if there is an early\\nstage of tuberculous process, of which we cannot be certain, a foreign\\ntour will be of no use. What is wanted is means of improving nutrition,\\nand not for lowering it.” And the celebrated doctor expounded his plan\\nof treatment with Soden waters, a remedy obviously prescribed primarily\\non the ground that they could do no harm.\\n\\nThe family doctor listened attentively and respectfully.\\n\\n“But in favor of foreign travel I would urge the change of habits, the\\nremoval from conditions calling up reminiscences. And then the mother\\nwishes it,” he added.\\n\\n“Ah! Well, in that case, to be sure, let them go. Only, those German\\nquacks are mischievous.... They ought to be persuaded.... Well, let\\nthem go then.”\\n\\nHe glanced once more at his watch.\\n\\n“Oh! time’s up already,” And he went to the door. The celebrated doctor\\nannounced to the princess (a feeling of what was due from him dictated\\nhis doing so) that he ought to see the patient once more.\\n\\n“What! another examination!” cried the mother, with horror.\\n\\n“Oh, no, only a few details, princess.”\\n\\n“Come this way.”\\n\\nAnd the mother, accompanied by the doctor, went into the drawing-room\\nto Kitty. Wasted and flushed, with a peculiar glitter in her eyes, left\\nthere by the agony of shame she had been put through, Kitty stood in\\nthe middle of the room. When the doctor came in she flushed crimson,\\nand her eyes filled with tears. All her illness and treatment struck\\nher as a thing so stupid, ludicrous even! Doctoring her seemed to her\\nas absurd as putting together the pieces of a broken vase. Her heart\\nwas broken. Why would they try to cure her with pills and powders? But\\nshe could not grieve her mother, especially as her mother considered\\nherself to blame.\\n\\n“May I trouble you to sit down, princess?” the celebrated doctor said\\nto her.\\n\\nHe sat down with a smile, facing her, felt her pulse, and again began\\nasking her tiresome questions. She answered him, and all at once got\\nup, furious.\\n\\n“Excuse me, doctor, but there is really no object in this. This is the\\nthird time you’ve asked me the same thing.”\\n\\nThe celebrated doctor did not take offense.\\n\\n“Nervous irritability,” he said to the princess, when Kitty had left\\nthe room. “However, I had finished....”\\n\\nAnd the doctor began scientifically explaining to the princess, as an\\nexceptionally intelligent woman, the condition of the young princess,\\nand concluded by insisting on the drinking of the waters, which were\\ncertainly harmless. At the question: Should they go abroad? the doctor\\nplunged into deep meditation, as though resolving a weighty problem.\\nFinally his decision was pronounced: they were to go abroad, but to put\\nno faith in foreign quacks, and to apply to him in any need.\\n\\nIt seemed as though some piece of good fortune had come to pass after\\nthe doctor had gone. The mother was much more cheerful when she went\\nback to her daughter, and Kitty pretended to be more cheerful. She had\\noften, almost always, to be pretending now.\\n\\n“Really, I’m quite well, mamma. But if you want to go abroad, let’s\\ngo!” she said, and trying to appear interested in the proposed tour,\\nshe began talking of the preparations for the journey 2\\n\\nSoon after the doctor, Dolly had arrived. She knew that there was to be\\na consultation that day, and though she was only just up after her\\nconfinement (she had another baby, a little girl, born at the end of\\nthe winter), though she had trouble and anxiety enough of her own, she\\nhad left her tiny baby and a sick child, to come and hear Kitty’s fate,\\nwhich was to be decided that day.\\n\\n“Well, well?” she said, coming into the drawing-room, without taking\\noff her hat. “You’re all in good spirits. Good news, then?”\\n\\nThey tried to tell her what the doctor had said, but it appeared that\\nthough the doctor had talked distinctly enough and at great length, it\\nwas utterly impossible to report what he had said. The only point of\\ninterest was that it was settled they should go abroad.\\n\\nDolly could not help sighing. Her dearest friend, her sister, was going\\naway. And her life was not a cheerful one. Her relations with Stepan\\nArkadyevitch after their reconciliation had become humiliating. The\\nunion Anna had cemented turned out to be of no solid character, and\\nfamily harmony was breaking down again at the same point. There had\\nbeen nothing definite, but Stepan Arkadyevitch was hardly ever at home;\\nmoney, too, was hardly ever forthcoming, and Dolly was continually\\ntortured by suspicions of infidelity, which she tried to dismiss,\\ndreading the agonies of jealousy she had been through already. The\\nfirst onslaught of jealousy, once lived through, could never come back\\nagain, and even the discovery of infidelities could never now affect\\nher as it had the first time. Such a discovery now would only mean\\nbreaking up family habits, and she let herself be deceived, despising\\nhim and still more herself, for the weakness. Besides this, the care of\\nher large family was a constant worry to her: first, the nursing of her\\nyoung baby did not go well, then the nurse had gone away, now one of\\nthe children had fallen ill.\\n\\n“Well, how are all of you?” asked her mother.\\n\\n“Ah, mamma, we have plenty of troubles of our own. Lili is ill, and I’m\\nafraid it’s scarlatina. I have come here now to hear about Kitty, and\\nthen I shall shut myself up entirely, if—God forbid—it should be\\nscarlatina.”\\n\\nThe old prince too had come in from his study after the doctor’s\\ndeparture, and after presenting his cheek to Dolly, and saying a few\\nwords to her, he turned to his wife:\\n\\n“How have you settled it? you’re going? Well, and what do you mean to\\ndo with me?”\\n\\n“I suppose you had better stay here, Alexander,” said his wife.\\n\\n“That’s as you like.”\\n\\n“Mamma, why shouldn’t father come with us?” said Kitty. “It would be\\nnicer for him and for us too.”\\n\\nThe old prince got up and stroked Kitty’s hair. She lifted her head and\\nlooked at him with a forced smile. It always seemed to her that he\\nunderstood her better than anyone in the family, though he did not say\\nmuch about her. Being the youngest, she was her father’s favorite, and\\nshe fancied that his love gave him insight. When now her glance met his\\nblue kindly eyes looking intently at her, it seemed to her that he saw\\nright through her, and understood all that was not good that was\\npassing within her. Reddening, she stretched out towards him expecting\\na kiss, but he only patted her hair and said:\\n\\n“These stupid chignons! There’s no getting at the real daughter. One\\nsimply strokes the bristles of dead women. Well, Dolinka,” he turned to\\nhis elder daughter, “what’s your young buck about, hey?”\\n\\n“Nothing, father,” answered Dolly, understanding that her husband was\\nmeant. “He’s always out; I scarcely ever see him,” she could not resist\\nadding with a sarcastic smile.\\n\\n“Why, hasn’t he gone into the country yet—to see about selling that\\nforest?”\\n\\n“No, he’s still getting ready for the journey.”\\n\\n“Oh, that’s it!” said the prince. “And so am I to be getting ready for\\na journey too? At your service,” he said to his wife, sitting down.\\n“And I tell you what, Katia,” he went on to his younger daughter, “you\\nmust wake up one fine day and say to yourself: Why, I’m quite well, and\\nmerry, and going out again with father for an early morning walk in the\\nfrost. Hey?”\\n\\nWhat her father said seemed simple enough, yet at these words Kitty\\nbecame confused and overcome like a detected criminal. “Yes, he sees it\\nall, he understands it all, and in these words he’s telling me that\\nthough I’m ashamed, I must get over my shame.” She could not pluck up\\nspirit to make any answer. She tried to begin, and all at once burst\\ninto tears, and rushed out of the room.\\n\\n“See what comes of your jokes!” the princess pounced down on her\\nhusband. “You’re always....” she began a string of reproaches.\\n\\nThe prince listened to the princess’s scolding rather a long while\\nwithout speaking, but his face was more and more frowning.\\n\\n“She’s so much to be pitied, poor child, so much to be pitied, and you\\ndon’t feel how it hurts her to hear the slightest reference to the\\ncause of it. Ah! to be so mistaken in people!” said the princess, and\\nby the change in her tone both Dolly and the prince knew she was\\nspeaking of Vronsky. “I don’t know why there aren’t laws against such\\nbase, dishonorable people.”\\n\\n“Ah, I can’t bear to hear you!” said the prince gloomily, getting up\\nfrom his low chair, and seeming anxious to get away, yet stopping in\\nthe doorway. “There are laws, madam, and since you’ve challenged me to\\nit, I’ll tell you who’s to blame for it all: you and you, you and\\nnobody else. Laws against such young gallants there have always been,\\nand there still are! Yes, if there has been nothing that ought not to\\nhave been, old as I am, I’d have called him out to the barrier, the\\nyoung dandy. Yes, and now you physic her and call in these quacks.”\\n\\nThe prince apparently had plenty more to say, but as soon as the\\nprincess heard his tone she subsided at once, and became penitent, as\\nshe always did on serious occasions.\\n\\n“Alexander, Alexander,” she whispered, moving to him and beginning to\\nweep.\\n\\nAs soon as she began to cry the prince too calmed down. He went up to\\nher.\\n\\n“There, that’s enough, that’s enough! You’re wretched too, I know. It\\ncan’t be helped. There’s no great harm done. God is merciful ...\\nthanks....” he said, not knowing what he was saying, as he responded to\\nthe tearful kiss of the princess that he felt on his hand. And the\\nprince went out of the room.\\n\\nBefore this, as soon as Kitty went out of the room in tears, Dolly,\\nwith her motherly, family instincts, had promptly perceived that here a\\nwoman’s work lay before her, and she prepared to do it. She took off\\nher hat, and, morally speaking, tucked up her sleeves and prepared for\\naction. While her mother was attacking her father, she tried to\\nrestrain her mother, so far as filial reverence would allow. During the\\nprince’s outburst she was silent; she felt ashamed for her mother, and\\ntender towards her father for so quickly being kind again. But when her\\nfather left them she made ready for what was the chief thing needful—to\\ngo to Kitty and console her.\\n\\n“I’d been meaning to tell you something for a long while, mamma: did\\nyou know that Levin meant to make Kitty an offer when he was here the\\nlast time? He told Stiva so.”\\n\\n“Well, what then? I don’t understand....”\\n\\n“So did Kitty perhaps refuse him?... She didn’t tell you so?”\\n\\n“No, she has said nothing to me either of one or the other; she’s too\\nproud. But I know it’s all on account of the other.”\\n\\n“Yes, but suppose she has refused Levin, and she wouldn’t have refused\\nhim if it hadn’t been for the other, I know. And then, he has deceived\\nher so horribly.”\\n\\nIt was too terrible for the princess to think how she had sinned\\nagainst her daughter, and she broke out angrily.\\n\\n“Oh, I really don’t understand! Nowadays they will all go their own\\nway, and mothers haven’t a word to say in anything, and then....”\\n\\n“Mamma, I’ll go up to her.”\\n\\n“Well, do. Did I tell you not to?” said her mother 3\\n\\nWhen she went into Kitty’s little room, a pretty, pink little room,\\nfull of knick-knacks in _vieux saxe,_ as fresh, and pink, and white,\\nand gay as Kitty herself had been two months ago, Dolly remembered how\\nthey had decorated the room the year before together, with what love\\nand gaiety. Her heart turned cold when she saw Kitty sitting on a low\\nchair near the door, her eyes fixed immovably on a corner of the rug.\\nKitty glanced at her sister, and the cold, rather ill-tempered\\nexpression of her face did not change.\\n\\n“I’m just going now, and I shall have to keep in and you won’t be able\\nto come to see me,” said Dolly, sitting down beside her. “I want to\\ntalk to you.”\\n\\n“What about?” Kitty asked swiftly, lifting her head in dismay.\\n\\n“What should it be, but your trouble?”\\n\\n“I have no trouble.”\\n\\n“Nonsense, Kitty. Do you suppose I could help knowing? I know all about\\nit. And believe me, it’s of so little consequence.... We’ve all been\\nthrough it.”\\n\\nKitty did not speak, and her face had a stern expression.\\n\\n“He’s not worth your grieving over him,” pursued Darya Alexandrovna,\\ncoming straight to the point.\\n\\n“No, because he has treated me with contempt,” said Kitty, in a\\nbreaking voice. “Don’t talk of it! Please, don’t talk of it!”\\n\\n“But who can have told you so? No one has said that. I’m certain he was\\nin love with you, and would still be in love with you, if it\\nhadn’t....”\\n\\n“Oh, the most awful thing of all for me is this sympathizing!” shrieked\\nKitty, suddenly flying into a passion. She turned round on her chair,\\nflushed crimson, and rapidly moving her fingers, pinched the clasp of\\nher belt first with one hand and then with the other. Dolly knew this\\ntrick her sister had of clenching her hands when she was much excited;\\nshe knew, too, that in moments of excitement Kitty was capable of\\nforgetting herself and saying a great deal too much, and Dolly would\\nhave soothed her, but it was too late.\\n\\n“What, what is it you want to make me feel, eh?” said Kitty quickly.\\n“That I’ve been in love with a man who didn’t care a straw for me, and\\nthat I’m dying of love for him? And this is said to me by my own\\nsister, who imagines that ... that ... that she’s sympathizing with\\nme!... I don’t want these condolences and humbug!”\\n\\n“Kitty, you’re unjust.”\\n\\n“Why are you tormenting me?”\\n\\n“But I ... quite the contrary ... I see you’re unhappy....”\\n\\nBut Kitty in her fury did not hear her.\\n\\n“I’ve nothing to grieve over and be comforted about. I am too proud\\never to allow myself to care for a man who does not love me.”\\n\\n“Yes, I don’t say so either.... Only one thing. Tell me the truth,”\\nsaid Darya Alexandrovna, taking her by the hand: “tell me, did Levin\\nspeak to you?...”\\n\\nThe mention of Levin’s name seemed to deprive Kitty of the last vestige\\nof self-control. She leaped up from her chair, and flinging her clasp\\non the ground, she gesticulated rapidly with her hands and said:\\n\\n“Why bring Levin in too? I can’t understand what you want to torment me\\nfor. I’ve told you, and I say it again, that I have some pride, and\\nnever, _never_ would I do as you’re doing—go back to a man who’s\\ndeceived you, who has cared for another woman. I can’t understand it!\\nYou may, but I can’t!”\\n\\nAnd saying these words she glanced at her sister, and seeing that Dolly\\nsat silent, her head mournfully bowed, Kitty, instead of running out of\\nthe room as she had meant to do, sat down near the door, and hid her\\nface in her handkerchief.\\n\\nThe silence lasted for two minutes: Dolly was thinking of herself. That\\nhumiliation of which she was always conscious came back to her with a\\npeculiar bitterness when her sister reminded her of it. She had not\\nlooked for such cruelty in her sister, and she was angry with her. But\\nsuddenly she heard the rustle of a skirt, and with it the sound of\\nheart-rending, smothered sobbing, and felt arms about her neck. Kitty\\nwas on her knees before her.\\n\\n“Dolinka, I am so, so wretched!” she whispered penitently. And the\\nsweet face covered with tears hid itself in Darya Alexandrovna’s skirt.\\n\\nAs though tears were the indispensable oil, without which the machinery\\nof mutual confidence could not run smoothly between the two sisters,\\nthe sisters after their tears talked, not of what was uppermost in\\ntheir minds, but, though they talked of outside matters, they\\nunderstood each other. Kitty knew that the words she had uttered in\\nanger about her husband’s infidelity and her humiliating position had\\ncut her poor sister to the heart, but that she had forgiven her. Dolly\\nfor her part knew all she had wanted to find out. She felt certain that\\nher surmises were correct; that Kitty’s misery, her inconsolable\\nmisery, was due precisely to the fact that Levin had made her an offer\\nand she had refused him, and Vronsky had deceived her, and that she was\\nfully prepared to love Levin and to detest Vronsky. Kitty said not a\\nword of that; she talked of nothing but her spiritual condition.\\n\\n“I have nothing to make me miserable,” she said, getting calmer; “but\\ncan you understand that everything has become hateful, loathsome,\\ncoarse to me, and I myself most of all? You can’t imagine what\\nloathsome thoughts I have about everything.”\\n\\n“Why, whatever loathsome thoughts can you have?” asked Dolly, smiling.\\n\\n“The most utterly loathsome and coarse: I can’t tell you. It’s not\\nunhappiness, or low spirits, but much worse. As though everything that\\nwas good in me was all hidden away, and nothing was left but the most\\nloathsome. Come, how am I to tell you?” she went on, seeing the puzzled\\nlook in her sister’s eyes. “Father began saying something to me just\\nnow.... It seems to me he thinks all I want is to be married. Mother\\ntakes me to a ball: it seems to me she only takes me to get me married\\noff as soon as may be, and be rid of me. I know it’s not the truth, but\\nI can’t drive away such thoughts. Eligible suitors, as they call them—I\\ncan’t bear to see them. It seems to me they’re taking stock of me and\\nsumming me up. In old days to go anywhere in a ball dress was a simple\\njoy to me, I admired myself; now I feel ashamed and awkward. And then!\\nThe doctor.... Then....” Kitty hesitated; she wanted to say further\\nthat ever since this change had taken place in her, Stepan Arkadyevitch\\nhad become insufferably repulsive to her, and that she could not see\\nhim without the grossest and most hideous conceptions rising before her\\nimagination.\\n\\n“Oh, well, everything presents itself to me, in the coarsest, most\\nloathsome light,” she went on. “That’s my illness. Perhaps it will pass\\noff.”\\n\\n“But you mustn’t think about it.”\\n\\n“I can’t help it. I’m never happy except with the children at your\\nhouse.”\\n\\n“What a pity you can’t be with me!”\\n\\n“Oh, yes, I’m coming. I’ve had scarlatina, and I’ll persuade mamma to\\nlet me.”\\n\\nKitty insisted on having her way, and went to stay at her sister’s and\\nnursed the children all through the scarlatina, for scarlatina it\\nturned out to be. The two sisters brought all the six children\\nsuccessfully through it, but Kitty was no better in health, and in Lent\\nthe Shtcherbatskys went abroad 4\\n\\nThe highest Petersburg society is essentially one: in it everyone knows\\neveryone else, everyone even visits everyone else. But this great set\\nhas its subdivisions. Anna Arkadyevna Karenina had friends and close\\nties in three different circles of this highest society. One circle was\\nher husband’s government official set, consisting of his colleagues and\\nsubordinates, brought together in the most various and capricious\\nmanner, and belonging to different social strata. Anna found it\\ndifficult now to recall the feeling of almost awe-stricken reverence\\nwhich she had at first entertained for these persons. Now she knew all\\nof them as people know one another in a country town; she knew their\\nhabits and weaknesses, and where the shoe pinched each one of them. She\\nknew their relations with one another and with the head authorities,\\nknew who was for whom, and how each one maintained his position, and\\nwhere they agreed and disagreed. But the circle of political, masculine\\ninterests had never interested her, in spite of countess Lidia\\nIvanovna’s influence, and she avoided it.\\n\\nAnother little set with which Anna was in close relations was the one\\nby means of which Alexey Alexandrovitch had made his career. The center\\nof this circle was the Countess Lidia Ivanovna. It was a set made up of\\nelderly, ugly, benevolent, and godly women, and clever, learned, and\\nambitious men. One of the clever people belonging to the set had called\\nit “the conscience of Petersburg society.” Alexey Alexandrovitch had\\nthe highest esteem for this circle, and Anna with her special gift for\\ngetting on with everyone, had in the early days of her life in\\nPetersburg made friends in this circle also. Now, since her return from\\nMoscow, she had come to feel this set insufferable. It seemed to her\\nthat both she and all of them were insincere, and she felt so bored and\\nill at ease in that world that she went to see the Countess Lidia\\nIvanovna as little as possible.\\n\\nThe third circle with which Anna had ties was preeminently the\\nfashionable world—the world of balls, of dinners, of sumptuous dresses,\\nthe world that hung on to the court with one hand, so as to avoid\\nsinking to the level of the demi-monde. For the demi-monde the members\\nof that fashionable world believed that they despised, though their\\ntastes were not merely similar, but in fact identical. Her connection\\nwith this circle was kept up through Princess Betsy Tverskaya, her\\ncousin’s wife, who had an income of a hundred and twenty thousand\\nroubles, and who had taken a great fancy to Anna ever since she first\\ncame out, showed her much attention, and drew her into her set, making\\nfun of Countess Lidia Ivanovna’s coterie.\\n\\n“When I’m old and ugly I’ll be the same,” Betsy used to say; “but for a\\npretty young woman like you it’s early days for that house of charity.”\\n\\nAnna had at first avoided as far as she could Princess Tverskaya’s\\nworld, because it necessitated an expenditure beyond her means, and\\nbesides in her heart she preferred the first circle. But since her\\nvisit to Moscow she had done quite the contrary. She avoided her\\nserious-minded friends, and went out into the fashionable world. There\\nshe met Vronsky, and experienced an agitating joy at those meetings.\\nShe met Vronsky specially often at Betsy’s for Betsy was a Vronsky by\\nbirth and his cousin. Vronsky was everywhere where he had any chance of\\nmeeting Anna, and speaking to her, when he could, of his love. She gave\\nhim no encouragement, but every time she met him there surged up in her\\nheart that same feeling of quickened life that had come upon her that\\nday in the railway carriage when she saw him for the first time. She\\nwas conscious herself that her delight sparkled in her eyes and curved\\nher lips into a smile, and she could not quench the expression of this\\ndelight.\\n\\nAt first Anna sincerely believed that she was displeased with him for\\ndaring to pursue her. Soon after her return from Moscow, on arriving at\\na _soirée_ where she had expected to meet him, and not finding him\\nthere, she realized distinctly from the rush of disappointment that she\\nhad been deceiving herself, and that this pursuit was not merely not\\ndistasteful to her, but that it made the whole interest of her life.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe celebrated singer was singing for the second time, and all the\\nfashionable world was in the theater. Vronsky, seeing his cousin from\\nhis stall in the front row, did not wait till the _entr’acte_, but went\\nto her box.\\n\\n“Why didn’t you come to dinner?” she said to him. “I marvel at the\\nsecond sight of lovers,” she added with a smile, so that no one but he\\ncould hear; “_she wasn’t there_. But come after the opera.”\\n\\nVronsky looked inquiringly at her. She nodded. He thanked her by a\\nsmile, and sat down beside her.\\n\\n“But how I remember your jeers!” continued Princess Betsy, who took a\\npeculiar pleasure in following up this passion to a successful issue.\\n“What’s become of all that? You’re caught, my dear boy.”\\n\\n“That’s my one desire, to be caught,” answered Vronsky, with his\\nserene, good-humored smile. “If I complain of anything it’s only that\\nI’m not caught enough, to tell the truth. I begin to lose hope.”\\n\\n“Why, whatever hope can you have?” said Betsy, offended on behalf of\\nher friend. “_Entendons nous...._” But in her eyes there were gleams of\\nlight that betrayed that she understood perfectly and precisely as he\\ndid what hope he might have.\\n\\n“None whatever,” said Vronsky, laughing and showing his even rows of\\nteeth. “Excuse me,” he added, taking an opera-glass out of her hand,\\nand proceeding to scrutinize, over her bare shoulder, the row of boxes\\nfacing them. “I’m afraid I’m becoming ridiculous.”\\n\\nHe was very well aware that he ran no risk of being ridiculous in the\\neyes of Betsy or any other fashionable people. He was very well aware\\nthat in their eyes the position of an unsuccessful lover of a girl, or\\nof any woman free to marry, might be ridiculous. But the position of a\\nman pursuing a married woman, and, regardless of everything, staking\\nhis life on drawing her into adultery, has something fine and grand\\nabout it, and can never be ridiculous; and so it was with a proud and\\ngay smile under his mustaches that he lowered the opera-glass and\\nlooked at his cousin.\\n\\n“But why was it you didn’t come to dinner?” she said, admiring him.\\n\\n“I must tell you about that. I was busily employed, and doing what, do\\nyou suppose? I’ll give you a hundred guesses, a thousand ... you’d\\nnever guess. I’ve been reconciling a husband with a man who’d insulted\\nhis wife. Yes, really!”\\n\\n“Well, did you succeed?”\\n\\n“Almost.”\\n\\n“You really must tell me about it,” she said, getting up. “Come to me\\nin the next _entr’acte._”\\n\\n“I can’t; I’m going to the French theater.”\\n\\n“From Nilsson?” Betsy queried in horror, though she could not herself\\nhave distinguished Nilsson’s voice from any chorus girl’s.\\n\\n“Can’t help it. I’ve an appointment there, all to do with my mission of\\npeace.”\\n\\n“‘Blessed are the peacemakers; theirs is the kingdom of heaven,’” said\\nBetsy, vaguely recollecting she had heard some similar saying from\\nsomeone. “Very well, then, sit down, and tell me what it’s all about.”\\n\\nAnd she sat down again 5\\n\\n“This is rather indiscreet, but it’s so good it’s an awful temptation\\nto tell the story,” said Vronsky, looking at her with his laughing\\neyes. “I’m not going to mention any names.”\\n\\n“But I shall guess, so much the better.”\\n\\n“Well, listen: two festive young men were driving—”\\n\\n“Officers of your regiment, of course?”\\n\\n“I didn’t say they were officers,—two young men who had been lunching.”\\n\\n“In other words, drinking.”\\n\\n“Possibly. They were driving on their way to dinner with a friend in\\nthe most festive state of mind. And they beheld a pretty woman in a\\nhired sledge; she overtakes them, looks round at them, and, so they\\nfancy anyway, nods to them and laughs. They, of course, follow her.\\nThey gallop at full speed. To their amazement, the fair one alights at\\nthe entrance of the very house to which they were going. The fair one\\ndarts upstairs to the top story. They get a glimpse of red lips under a\\nshort veil, and exquisite little feet.”\\n\\n“You describe it with such feeling that I fancy you must be one of the\\ntwo.”\\n\\n“And after what you said, just now! Well, the young men go in to their\\ncomrade’s; he was giving a farewell dinner. There they certainly did\\ndrink a little too much, as one always does at farewell dinners. And at\\ndinner they inquire who lives at the top in that house. No one knows;\\nonly their host’s valet, in answer to their inquiry whether any ‘young\\nladies’ are living on the top floor, answered that there were a great\\nmany of them about there. After dinner the two young men go into their\\nhost’s study, and write a letter to the unknown fair one. They compose\\nan ardent epistle, a declaration in fact, and they carry the letter\\nupstairs themselves, so as to elucidate whatever might appear not\\nperfectly intelligible in the letter.”\\n\\n“Why are you telling me these horrible stories? Well?”\\n\\n“They ring. A maid-servant opens the door, they hand her the letter,\\nand assure the maid that they’re both so in love that they’ll die on\\nthe spot at the door. The maid, stupefied, carries in their messages.\\nAll at once a gentleman appears with whiskers like sausages, as red as\\na lobster, announces that there is no one living in the flat except his\\nwife, and sends them both about their business.”\\n\\n“How do you know he had whiskers like sausages, as you say?”\\n\\n“Ah, you shall hear. I’ve just been to make peace between them.”\\n\\n“Well, and what then?”\\n\\n“That’s the most interesting part of the story. It appears that it’s a\\nhappy couple, a government clerk and his lady. The government clerk\\nlodges a complaint, and I became a mediator, and such a mediator!... I\\nassure you Talleyrand couldn’t hold a candle to me.”\\n\\n“Why, where was the difficulty?”\\n\\n“Ah, you shall hear.... We apologize in due form: we are in despair, we\\nentreat forgiveness for the unfortunate misunderstanding. The\\ngovernment clerk with the sausages begins to melt, but he, too, desires\\nto express his sentiments, and as soon as ever he begins to express\\nthem, he begins to get hot and say nasty things, and again I’m obliged\\nto trot out all my diplomatic talents. I allowed that their conduct was\\nbad, but I urged him to take into consideration their heedlessness,\\ntheir youth; then, too, the young men had only just been lunching\\ntogether. ‘You understand. They regret it deeply, and beg you to\\noverlook their misbehavior.’ The government clerk was softened once\\nmore. ‘I consent, count, and am ready to overlook it; but you perceive\\nthat my wife—my wife’s a respectable woman—has been exposed to the\\npersecution, and insults, and effrontery of young upstarts,\\nscoundrels....’ And you must understand, the young upstarts are present\\nall the while, and I have to keep the peace between them. Again I call\\nout all my diplomacy, and again as soon as the thing was about at an\\nend, our friend the government clerk gets hot and red, and his sausages\\nstand on end with wrath, and once more I launch out into diplomatic\\nwiles.”\\n\\n“Ah, he must tell you this story!” said Betsy, laughing, to a lady who\\ncame into her box. “He has been making me laugh so.”\\n\\n“Well, _bonne chance_!” she added, giving Vronsky one finger of the\\nhand in which she held her fan, and with a shrug of her shoulders she\\ntwitched down the bodice of her gown that had worked up, so as to be\\nduly naked as she moved forward towards the footlights into the light\\nof the gas, and the sight of all eyes.\\n\\nVronsky drove to the French theater, where he really had to see the\\ncolonel of his regiment, who never missed a single performance there.\\nHe wanted to see him, to report on the result of his mediation, which\\nhad occupied and amused him for the last three days. Petritsky, whom he\\nliked, was implicated in the affair, and the other culprit was a\\ncapital fellow and first-rate comrade, who had lately joined the\\nregiment, the young Prince Kedrov. And what was most important, the\\ninterests of the regiment were involved in it too.\\n\\nBoth the young men were in Vronsky’s company. The colonel of the\\nregiment was waited upon by the government clerk, Venden, with a\\ncomplaint against his officers, who had insulted his wife. His young\\nwife, so Venden told the story—he had been married half a year—was at\\nchurch with her mother, and suddenly overcome by indisposition, arising\\nfrom her interesting condition, she could not remain standing, she\\ndrove home in the first sledge, a smart-looking one, she came across.\\nOn the spot the officers set off in pursuit of her; she was alarmed,\\nand feeling still more unwell, ran up the staircase home. Venden\\nhimself, on returning from his office, heard a ring at their bell and\\nvoices, went out, and seeing the intoxicated officers with a letter, he\\nhad turned them out. He asked for exemplary punishment.\\n\\n“Yes, it’s all very well,” said the colonel to Vronsky, whom he had\\ninvited to come and see him. “Petritsky’s becoming impossible. Not a\\nweek goes by without some scandal. This government clerk won’t let it\\ndrop, he’ll go on with the thing.”\\n\\nVronsky saw all the thanklessness of the business, and that there could\\nbe no question of a duel in it, that everything must be done to soften\\nthe government clerk, and hush the matter up. The colonel had called in\\nVronsky just because he knew him to be an honorable and intelligent\\nman, and, more than all, a man who cared for the honor of the regiment.\\nThey talked it over, and decided that Petritsky and Kedrov must go with\\nVronsky to Venden’s to apologize. The colonel and Vronsky were both\\nfully aware that Vronsky’s name and rank would be sure to contribute\\ngreatly to the softening of the injured husband’s feelings.\\n\\nAnd these two influences were not in fact without effect; though the\\nresult remained, as Vronsky had described, uncertain.\\n\\nOn reaching the French theater, Vronsky retired to the foyer with the\\ncolonel, and reported to him his success, or non-success. The colonel,\\nthinking it all over, made up his mind not to pursue the matter\\nfurther, but then for his own satisfaction proceeded to cross-examine\\nVronsky about his interview; and it was a long while before he could\\nrestrain his laughter, as Vronsky described how the government clerk,\\nafter subsiding for a while, would suddenly flare up again, as he\\nrecalled the details, and how Vronsky, at the last half word of\\nconciliation, skillfully manœuvered a retreat, shoving Petritsky out\\nbefore him.\\n\\n“It’s a disgraceful story, but killing. Kedrov really can’t fight the\\ngentleman! Was he so awfully hot?” he commented, laughing. “But what do\\nyou say to Claire today? She’s marvelous,” he went on, speaking of a\\nnew French actress. “However often you see her, every day she’s\\ndifferent. It’s only the French who can do that 6\\n\\nPrincess Betsy drove home from the theater, without waiting for the end\\nof the last act. She had only just time to go into her dressing-room,\\nsprinkle her long, pale face with powder, rub it, set her dress to\\nrights, and order tea in the big drawing-room, when one after another\\ncarriages drove up to her huge house in Bolshaia Morskaia. Her guests\\nstepped out at the wide entrance, and the stout porter, who used to\\nread the newspapers in the mornings behind the glass door, to the\\nedification of the passers-by, noiselessly opened the immense door,\\nletting the visitors pass by him into the house.\\n\\nAlmost at the same instant the hostess, with freshly arranged coiffure\\nand freshened face, walked in at one door and her guests at the other\\ndoor of the drawing-room, a large room with dark walls, downy rugs, and\\na brightly lighted table, gleaming with the light of candles, white\\ncloth, silver samovar, and transparent china tea-things.\\n\\nThe hostess sat down at the table and took off her gloves. Chairs were\\nset with the aid of footmen, moving almost imperceptibly about the\\nroom; the party settled itself, divided into two groups: one round the\\nsamovar near the hostess, the other at the opposite end of the\\ndrawing-room, round the handsome wife of an ambassador, in black\\nvelvet, with sharply defined black eyebrows. In both groups\\nconversation wavered, as it always does, for the first few minutes,\\nbroken up by meetings, greetings, offers of tea, and as it were,\\nfeeling about for something to rest upon.\\n\\n“She’s exceptionally good as an actress; one can see she’s studied\\nKaulbach,” said a diplomatic attaché in the group round the\\nambassador’s wife. “Did you notice how she fell down?...”\\n\\n“Oh, please, don’t let us talk about Nilsson! No one can possibly say\\nanything new about her,” said a fat, red-faced, flaxen-headed lady,\\nwithout eyebrows and chignon, wearing an old silk dress. This was\\nPrincess Myakaya, noted for her simplicity and the roughness of her\\nmanners, and nicknamed _enfant terrible_. Princess Myakaya, sitting in\\nthe middle between the two groups, and listening to both, took part in\\nthe conversation first of one and then of the other. “Three people have\\nused that very phrase about Kaulbach to me today already, just as\\nthough they had made a compact about it. And I can’t see why they liked\\nthat remark so.”\\n\\nThe conversation was cut short by this observation, and a new subject\\nhad to be thought of again.\\n\\n“Do tell me something amusing but not spiteful,” said the ambassador’s\\nwife, a great proficient in the art of that elegant conversation called\\nby the English _small talk_. She addressed the attaché, who was at a\\nloss now what to begin upon.\\n\\n“They say that that’s a difficult task, that nothing’s amusing that\\nisn’t spiteful,” he began with a smile. “But I’ll try. Get me a\\nsubject. It all lies in the subject. If a subject’s given me, it’s easy\\nto spin something round it. I often think that the celebrated talkers\\nof the last century would have found it difficult to talk cleverly now.\\nEverything clever is so stale....”\\n\\n“That has been said long ago,” the ambassador’s wife interrupted him,\\nlaughing.\\n\\nThe conversation began amiably, but just because it was too amiable, it\\ncame to a stop again. They had to have recourse to the sure,\\nnever-failing topic—gossip.\\n\\n“Don’t you think there’s something Louis Quinze about Tushkevitch?” he\\nsaid, glancing towards a handsome, fair-haired young man, standing at\\nthe table.\\n\\n“Oh, yes! He’s in the same style as the drawing-room and that’s why it\\nis he’s so often here.”\\n\\nThis conversation was maintained, since it rested on allusions to what\\ncould not be talked of in that room—that is to say, of the relations of\\nTushkevitch with their hostess.\\n\\nRound the samovar and the hostess the conversation had been meanwhile\\nvacillating in just the same way between three inevitable topics: the\\nlatest piece of public news, the theater, and scandal. It, too, came\\nfinally to rest on the last topic, that is, ill-natured gossip.\\n\\n“Have you heard the Maltishtcheva woman—the mother, not the\\ndaughter—has ordered a costume in _diable rose_ color?”\\n\\n“Nonsense! No, that’s too lovely!”\\n\\n“I wonder that with her sense—for she’s not a fool, you know—that she\\ndoesn’t see how funny she is.”\\n\\nEveryone had something to say in censure or ridicule of the luckless\\nMadame Maltishtcheva, and the conversation crackled merrily, like a\\nburning faggot-stack.\\n\\nThe husband of Princess Betsy, a good-natured fat man, an ardent\\ncollector of engravings, hearing that his wife had visitors, came into\\nthe drawing-room before going to his club. Stepping noiselessly over\\nthe thick rugs, he went up to Princess Myakaya.\\n\\n“How did you like Nilsson?” he asked.\\n\\n“Oh, how can you steal upon anyone like that! How you startled me!” she\\nresponded. “Please don’t talk to me about the opera; you know nothing\\nabout music. I’d better meet you on your own ground, and talk about\\nyour majolica and engravings. Come now, what treasure have you been\\nbuying lately at the old curiosity shops?”\\n\\n“Would you like me to show you? But you don’t understand such things.”\\n\\n“Oh, do show me! I’ve been learning about them at those—what’s their\\nnames?... the bankers ... they’ve some splendid engravings. They showed\\nthem to us.”\\n\\n“Why, have you been at the Schützburgs?” asked the hostess from the\\nsamovar.\\n\\n“Yes, _ma chère_. They asked my husband and me to dinner, and told us\\nthe sauce at that dinner cost a hundred pounds,” Princess Myakaya said,\\nspeaking loudly, and conscious everyone was listening; “and very nasty\\nsauce it was, some green mess. We had to ask them, and I made them\\nsauce for eighteen pence, and everybody was very much pleased with it.\\nI can’t run to hundred-pound sauces.”\\n\\n“She’s unique!” said the lady of the house.\\n\\n“Marvelous!” said someone.\\n\\nThe sensation produced by Princess Myakaya’s speeches was always\\nunique, and the secret of the sensation she produced lay in the fact\\nthat though she spoke not always appropriately, as now, she said simple\\nthings with some sense in them. In the society in which she lived such\\nplain statements produced the effect of the wittiest epigram. Princess\\nMyakaya could never see why it had that effect, but she knew it had,\\nand took advantage of it.\\n\\nAs everyone had been listening while Princess Myakaya spoke, and so the\\nconversation around the ambassador’s wife had dropped, Princess Betsy\\ntried to bring the whole party together, and turned to the ambassador’s\\nwife.\\n\\n“Will you really not have tea? You should come over here by us.”\\n\\n“No, we’re very happy here,” the ambassador’s wife responded with a\\nsmile, and she went on with the conversation that had been begun.\\n\\nIt was a very agreeable conversation. They were criticizing the\\nKarenins, husband and wife.\\n\\n“Anna is quite changed since her stay in Moscow. There’s something\\nstrange about her,” said her friend.\\n\\n“The great change is that she brought back with her the shadow of\\nAlexey Vronsky,” said the ambassador’s wife.\\n\\n“Well, what of it? There’s a fable of Grimm’s about a man without a\\nshadow, a man who’s lost his shadow. And that’s his punishment for\\nsomething. I never could understand how it was a punishment. But a\\nwoman must dislike being without a shadow.”\\n\\n“Yes, but women with a shadow usually come to a bad end,” said Anna’s\\nfriend.\\n\\n“Bad luck to your tongue!” said Princess Myakaya suddenly. “Madame\\nKarenina’s a splendid woman. I don’t like her husband, but I like her\\nvery much.”\\n\\n“Why don’t you like her husband? He’s such a remarkable man,” said the\\nambassador’s wife. “My husband says there are few statesmen like him in\\nEurope.”\\n\\n“And my husband tells me just the same, but I don’t believe it,” said\\nPrincess Myakaya. “If our husbands didn’t talk to us, we should see the\\nfacts as they are. Alexey Alexandrovitch, to my thinking, is simply a\\nfool. I say it in a whisper ... but doesn’t it really make everything\\nclear? Before, when I was told to consider him clever, I kept looking\\nfor his ability, and thought myself a fool for not seeing it; but\\ndirectly I said, _he’s a fool,_ though only in a whisper, everything’s\\nexplained, isn’t it?”\\n\\n“How spiteful you are today!”\\n\\n“Not a bit. I’d no other way out of it. One of the two had to be a\\nfool. And, well, you know one can’t say that of oneself.”\\n\\n“‘No one is satisfied with his fortune, and everyone is satisfied with\\nhis wit.’” The attaché repeated the French saying.\\n\\n“That’s just it, just it,” Princess Myakaya turned to him. “But the\\npoint is that I won’t abandon Anna to your mercies. She’s so nice, so\\ncharming. How can she help it if they’re all in love with her, and\\nfollow her about like shadows?”\\n\\n“Oh, I had no idea of blaming her for it,” Anna’s friend said in\\nself-defense.\\n\\n“If no one follows us about like a shadow, that’s no proof that we’ve\\nany right to blame her.”\\n\\nAnd having duly disposed of Anna’s friend, the Princess Myakaya got up,\\nand together with the ambassador’s wife, joined the group at the table,\\nwhere the conversation was dealing with the king of Prussia.\\n\\n“What wicked gossip were you talking over there?” asked Betsy.\\n\\n“About the Karenins. The princess gave us a sketch of Alexey\\nAlexandrovitch,” said the ambassador’s wife with a smile, as she sat\\ndown at the table.\\n\\n“Pity we didn’t hear it!” said Princess Betsy, glancing towards the\\ndoor. “Ah, here you are at last!” she said, turning with a smile to\\nVronsky, as he came in.\\n\\nVronsky was not merely acquainted with all the persons whom he was\\nmeeting here; he saw them all every day; and so he came in with the\\nquiet manner with which one enters a room full of people from whom one\\nhas only just parted.\\n\\n“Where do I come from?” he said, in answer to a question from the\\nambassador’s wife. “Well, there’s no help for it, I must confess. From\\nthe _opera bouffe_. I do believe I’ve seen it a hundred times, and\\nalways with fresh enjoyment. It’s exquisite! I know it’s disgraceful,\\nbut I go to sleep at the opera, and I sit out the _opera bouffe_ to the\\nlast minute, and enjoy it. This evening....”\\n\\nHe mentioned a French actress, and was going to tell something about\\nher; but the ambassador’s wife, with playful horror, cut him short.\\n\\n“Please don’t tell us about that horror.”\\n\\n“All right, I won’t especially as everyone knows those horrors.”\\n\\n“And we should all go to see them if it were accepted as the correct\\nthing, like the opera,” chimed in Princess Myakaya 7\\n\\nSteps were heard at the door, and Princess Betsy, knowing it was Madame\\nKarenina, glanced at Vronsky. He was looking towards the door, and his\\nface wore a strange new expression. Joyfully, intently, and at the same\\ntime timidly, he gazed at the approaching figure, and slowly he rose to\\nhis feet. Anna walked into the drawing-room. Holding herself extremely\\nerect, as always, looking straight before her, and moving with her\\nswift, resolute, and light step, that distinguished her from all other\\nsociety women, she crossed the short space to her hostess, shook hands\\nwith her, smiled, and with the same smile looked around at Vronsky.\\nVronsky bowed low and pushed a chair up for her.\\n\\nShe acknowledged this only by a slight nod, flushed a little, and\\nfrowned. But immediately, while rapidly greeting her acquaintances, and\\nshaking the hands proffered to her, she addressed Princess Betsy:\\n\\n“I have been at Countess Lidia’s, and meant to have come here earlier,\\nbut I stayed on. Sir John was there. He’s very interesting.”\\n\\n“Oh, that’s this missionary?”\\n\\n“Yes; he told us about the life in India, most interesting things.”\\n\\nThe conversation, interrupted by her coming in, flickered up again like\\nthe light of a lamp being blown out.\\n\\n“Sir John! Yes, Sir John; I’ve seen him. He speaks well. The Vlassieva\\ngirl’s quite in love with him.”\\n\\n“And is it true the younger Vlassieva girl’s to marry Topov?”\\n\\n“Yes, they say it’s quite a settled thing.”\\n\\n“I wonder at the parents! They say it’s a marriage for love.”\\n\\n“For love? What antediluvian notions you have! Can one talk of love in\\nthese days?” said the ambassador’s wife.\\n\\n“What’s to be done? It’s a foolish old fashion that’s kept up still,”\\nsaid Vronsky.\\n\\n“So much the worse for those who keep up the fashion. The only happy\\nmarriages I know are marriages of prudence.”\\n\\n“Yes, but then how often the happiness of these prudent marriages flies\\naway like dust just because that passion turns up that they have\\nrefused to recognize,” said Vronsky.\\n\\n“But by marriages of prudence we mean those in which both parties have\\nsown their wild oats already. That’s like scarlatina—one has to go\\nthrough it and get it over.”\\n\\n“Then they ought to find out how to vaccinate for love, like smallpox.”\\n\\n“I was in love in my young days with a deacon,” said the Princess\\nMyakaya. “I don’t know that it did me any good.”\\n\\n“No; I imagine, joking apart, that to know love, one must make mistakes\\nand then correct them,” said Princess Betsy.\\n\\n“Even after marriage?” said the ambassador’s wife playfully.\\n\\n“‘It’s never too late to mend.’” The attaché repeated the English\\nproverb.\\n\\n“Just so,” Betsy agreed; “one must make mistakes and correct them. What\\ndo you think about it?” she turned to Anna, who, with a faintly\\nperceptible resolute smile on her lips, was listening in silence to the\\nconversation.\\n\\n“I think,” said Anna, playing with the glove she had taken off, “I\\nthink ... of so many men, so many minds, certainly so many hearts, so\\nmany kinds of love.”\\n\\nVronsky was gazing at Anna, and with a fainting heart waiting for what\\nshe would say. He sighed as after a danger escaped when she uttered\\nthese words.\\n\\nAnna suddenly turned to him.\\n\\n“Oh, I have had a letter from Moscow. They write me that Kitty\\nShtcherbatskaya’s very ill.”\\n\\n“Really?” said Vronsky, knitting his brows.\\n\\nAnna looked sternly at him.\\n\\n“That doesn’t interest you?”\\n\\n“On the contrary, it does, very much. What was it exactly they told\\nyou, if I may know?” he questioned.\\n\\nAnna got up and went to Betsy.\\n\\n“Give me a cup of tea,” she said, standing at her table.\\n\\nWhile Betsy was pouring out the tea, Vronsky went up to Anna.\\n\\n“What is it they write to you?” he repeated.\\n\\n“I often think men have no understanding of what’s not honorable though\\nthey’re always talking of it,” said Anna, without answering him. “I’ve\\nwanted to tell you so a long while,” she added, and moving a few steps\\naway, she sat down at a table in a corner covered with albums.\\n\\n“I don’t quite understand the meaning of your words,” he said, handing\\nher the cup.\\n\\nShe glanced towards the sofa beside her, and he instantly sat down.\\n\\n“Yes, I have been wanting to tell you,” she said, not looking at him.\\n“You behaved wrongly, very wrongly.”\\n\\n“Do you suppose I don’t know that I’ve acted wrongly? But who was the\\ncause of my doing so?”\\n\\n“What do you say that to me for?” she said, glancing severely at him.\\n\\n“You know what for,” he answered boldly and joyfully, meeting her\\nglance and not dropping his eyes.\\n\\nNot he, but she, was confused.\\n\\n“That only shows you have no heart,” she said. But her eyes said that\\nshe knew he had a heart, and that was why she was afraid of him.\\n\\n“What you spoke of just now was a mistake, and not love.”\\n\\n“Remember that I have forbidden you to utter that word, that hateful\\nword,” said Anna, with a shudder. But at once she felt that by that\\nvery word “forbidden” she had shown that she acknowledged certain\\nrights over him, and by that very fact was encouraging him to speak of\\nlove. “I have long meant to tell you this,” she went on, looking\\nresolutely into his eyes, and hot all over from the burning flush on\\nher cheeks. “I’ve come on purpose this evening, knowing I should meet\\nyou. I have come to tell you that this must end. I have never blushed\\nbefore anyone, and you force me to feel to blame for something.”\\n\\nHe looked at her and was struck by a new spiritual beauty in her face.\\n\\n“What do you wish of me?” he said simply and seriously.\\n\\n“I want you to go to Moscow and ask for Kitty’s forgiveness,” she said.\\n\\n“You don’t wish that?” he said.\\n\\nHe saw she was saying what she forced herself to say, not what she\\nwanted to say.\\n\\n“If you love me, as you say,” she whispered, “do so that I may be at\\npeace.”\\n\\nHis face grew radiant.\\n\\n“Don’t you know that you’re all my life to me? But I know no peace, and\\nI can’t give it to you; all myself—and love ... yes. I can’t think of\\nyou and myself apart. You and I are one to me. And I see no chance\\nbefore us of peace for me or for you. I see a chance of despair, of\\nwretchedness ... or I see a chance of bliss, what bliss!... Can it be\\nthere’s no chance of it?” he murmured with his lips; but she heard.\\n\\nShe strained every effort of her mind to say what ought to be said. But\\ninstead of that she let her eyes rest on him, full of love, and made no\\nanswer.\\n\\n“It’s come!” he thought in ecstasy. “When I was beginning to despair,\\nand it seemed there would be no end—it’s come! She loves me! She owns\\nit!”\\n\\n“Then do this for me: never say such things to me, and let us be\\nfriends,” she said in words; but her eyes spoke quite differently.\\n\\n“Friends we shall never be, you know that yourself. Whether we shall be\\nthe happiest or the wretchedest of people—that’s in your hands.”\\n\\nShe would have said something, but he interrupted her.\\n\\n“I ask one thing only: I ask for the right to hope, to suffer as I do.\\nBut if even that cannot be, command me to disappear, and I disappear.\\nYou shall not see me if my presence is distasteful to you.”\\n\\n“I don’t want to drive you away.”\\n\\n“Only don’t change anything, leave everything as it is,” he said in a\\nshaky voice. “Here’s your husband.”\\n\\nAt that instant Alexey Alexandrovitch did in fact walk into the room\\nwith his calm, awkward gait.\\n\\nGlancing at his wife and Vronsky, he went up to the lady of the house,\\nand sitting down for a cup of tea, began talking in his deliberate,\\nalways audible voice, in his habitual tone of banter, ridiculing\\nsomeone.\\n\\n“Your Rambouillet is in full conclave,” he said, looking round at all\\nthe party; “the graces and the muses.”\\n\\nBut Princess Betsy could not endure that tone of his—“sneering,” as she\\ncalled it, using the English word, and like a skillful hostess she at\\nonce brought him into a serious conversation on the subject of\\nuniversal conscription. Alexey Alexandrovitch was immediately\\ninterested in the subject, and began seriously defending the new\\nimperial decree against Princess Betsy, who had attacked it.\\n\\nVronsky and Anna still sat at the little table.\\n\\n“This is getting indecorous,” whispered one lady, with an expressive\\nglance at Madame Karenina, Vronsky, and her husband.\\n\\n“What did I tell you?” said Anna’s friend.\\n\\nBut not only those ladies, almost everyone in the room, even the\\nPrincess Myakaya and Betsy herself, looked several times in the\\ndirection of the two who had withdrawn from the general circle, as\\nthough that were a disturbing fact. Alexey Alexandrovitch was the only\\nperson who did not once look in that direction, and was not diverted\\nfrom the interesting discussion he had entered upon.\\n\\nNoticing the disagreeable impression that was being made on everyone,\\nPrincess Betsy slipped someone else into her place to listen to Alexey\\nAlexandrovitch, and went up to Anna.\\n\\n“I’m always amazed at the clearness and precision of your husband’s\\nlanguage,” she said. “The most transcendental ideas seem to be within\\nmy grasp when he’s speaking.”\\n\\n“Oh, yes!” said Anna, radiant with a smile of happiness, and not\\nunderstanding a word of what Betsy had said. She crossed over to the\\nbig table and took part in the general conversation.\\n\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch, after staying half an hour, went up to his wife\\nand suggested that they should go home together. But she answered, not\\nlooking at him, that she was staying to supper. Alexey Alexandrovitch\\nmade his bows and withdrew.\\n\\nThe fat old Tatar, Madame Karenina’s coachman, was with difficulty\\nholding one of her pair of grays, chilled with the cold and rearing at\\nthe entrance. A footman stood opening the carriage door. The\\nhall-porter stood holding open the great door of the house. Anna\\nArkadyevna, with her quick little hand, was unfastening the lace of her\\nsleeve, caught in the hook of her fur cloak, and with bent head\\nlistening to the words Vronsky murmured as he escorted her down.\\n\\n“You’ve said nothing, of course, and I ask nothing,” he was saying;\\n“but you know that friendship’s not what I want: that there’s only one\\nhappiness in life for me, that word that you dislike so ... yes,\\nlove!...”\\n\\n“Love,” she repeated slowly, in an inner voice, and suddenly, at the\\nvery instant she unhooked the lace, she added, “Why I don’t like the\\nword is that it means too much to me, far more than you can\\nunderstand,” and she glanced into his face. “_Au revoir!_”\\n\\nShe gave him her hand, and with her rapid, springy step she passed by\\nthe porter and vanished into the carriage.\\n\\nHer glance, the touch of her hand, set him aflame. He kissed the palm\\nof his hand where she had touched it, and went home, happy in the sense\\nthat he had got nearer to the attainment of his aims that evening than\\nduring the last two months 8\\n\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch had seen nothing striking or improper in the fact\\nthat his wife was sitting with Vronsky at a table apart, in eager\\nconversation with him about something. But he noticed that to the rest\\nof the party this appeared something striking and improper, and for\\nthat reason it seemed to him too to be improper. He made up his mind\\nthat he must speak of it to his wife.\\n\\nOn reaching home Alexey Alexandrovitch went to his study, as he usually\\ndid, seated himself in his low chair, opened a book on the Papacy at\\nthe place where he had laid the paper-knife in it, and read till one\\no’clock, just as he usually did. But from time to time he rubbed his\\nhigh forehead and shook his head, as though to drive away something. At\\nhis usual time he got up and made his toilet for the night. Anna\\nArkadyevna had not yet come in. With a book under his arm he went\\nupstairs. But this evening, instead of his usual thoughts and\\nmeditations upon official details, his thoughts were absorbed by his\\nwife and something disagreeable connected with her. Contrary to his\\nusual habit, he did not get into bed, but fell to walking up and down\\nthe rooms with his hands clasped behind his back. He could not go to\\nbed, feeling that it was absolutely needful for him first to think\\nthoroughly over the position that had just arisen.\\n\\nWhen Alexey Alexandrovitch had made up his mind that he must talk to\\nhis wife about it, it had seemed a very easy and simple matter. But\\nnow, when he began to think over the question that had just presented\\nitself, it seemed to him very complicated and difficult.\\n\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch was not jealous. Jealousy according to his\\nnotions was an insult to one’s wife, and one ought to have confidence\\nin one’s wife. Why one ought to have confidence—that is to say,\\ncomplete conviction that his young wife would always love him—he did\\nnot ask himself. But he had no experience of lack of confidence,\\nbecause he had confidence in her, and told himself that he ought to\\nhave it. Now, though his conviction that jealousy was a shameful\\nfeeling and that one ought to feel confidence, had not broken down, he\\nfelt that he was standing face to face with something illogical and\\nirrational, and did not know what was to be done. Alexey Alexandrovitch\\nwas standing face to face with life, with the possibility of his wife’s\\nloving someone other than himself, and this seemed to him very\\nirrational and incomprehensible because it was life itself. All his\\nlife Alexey Alexandrovitch had lived and worked in official spheres,\\nhaving to do with the reflection of life. And every time he had\\nstumbled against life itself he had shrunk away from it. Now he\\nexperienced a feeling akin to that of a man who, while calmly crossing\\na precipice by a bridge, should suddenly discover that the bridge is\\nbroken, and that there is a chasm below. That chasm was life itself,\\nthe bridge that artificial life in which Alexey Alexandrovitch had\\nlived. For the first time the question presented itself to him of the\\npossibility of his wife’s loving someone else, and he was horrified at\\nit.\\n\\nHe did not undress, but walked up and down with his regular tread over\\nthe resounding parquet of the dining-room, where one lamp was burning,\\nover the carpet of the dark drawing-room, in which the light was\\nreflected on the big new portrait of himself hanging over the sofa, and\\nacross her boudoir, where two candles burned, lighting up the portraits\\nof her parents and woman friends, and the pretty knick-knacks of her\\nwriting-table, that he knew so well. He walked across her boudoir to\\nthe bedroom door, and turned back again. At each turn in his walk,\\nespecially at the parquet of the lighted dining-room, he halted and\\nsaid to himself, “Yes, this I must decide and put a stop to; I must\\nexpress my view of it and my decision.” And he turned back again. “But\\nexpress what—what decision?” he said to himself in the drawing-room,\\nand he found no reply. “But after all,” he asked himself before turning\\ninto the boudoir, “what has occurred? Nothing. She was talking a long\\nwhile with him. But what of that? Surely women in society can talk to\\nwhom they please. And then, jealousy means lowering both myself and\\nher,” he told himself as he went into her boudoir; but this dictum,\\nwhich had always had such weight with him before, had now no weight and\\nno meaning at all. And from the bedroom door he turned back again; but\\nas he entered the dark drawing-room some inner voice told him that it\\nwas not so, and that if others noticed it that showed that there was\\nsomething. And he said to himself again in the dining-room, “Yes, I\\nmust decide and put a stop to it, and express my view of it....” And\\nagain at the turn in the drawing-room he asked himself, “Decide how?”\\nAnd again he asked himself, “What had occurred?” and answered,\\n“Nothing,” and recollected that jealousy was a feeling insulting to his\\nwife; but again in the drawing-room he was convinced that something had\\nhappened. His thoughts, like his body, went round a complete circle,\\nwithout coming upon anything new. He noticed this, rubbed his forehead,\\nand sat down in her boudoir.\\n\\nThere, looking at her table, with the malachite blotting case lying at\\nthe top and an unfinished letter, his thoughts suddenly changed. He\\nbegan to think of her, of what she was thinking and feeling. For the\\nfirst time he pictured vividly to himself her personal life, her ideas,\\nher desires, and the idea that she could and should have a separate\\nlife of her own seemed to him so alarming that he made haste to dispel\\nit. It was the chasm which he was afraid to peep into. To put himself\\nin thought and feeling in another person’s place was a spiritual\\nexercise not natural to Alexey Alexandrovitch. He looked on this\\nspiritual exercise as a harmful and dangerous abuse of the fancy.\\n\\n“And the worst of it all,” thought he, “is that just now, at the very\\nmoment when my great work is approaching completion” (he was thinking\\nof the project he was bringing forward at the time), “when I stand in\\nneed of all my mental peace and all my energies, just now this stupid\\nworry should fall foul of me. But what’s to be done? I’m not one of\\nthose men who submit to uneasiness and worry without having the force\\nof character to face them.\\n\\n“I must think it over, come to a decision, and put it out of my mind,”\\nhe said aloud.\\n\\n“The question of her feelings, of what has passed and may be passing in\\nher soul, that’s not my affair; that’s the affair of her conscience,\\nand falls under the head of religion,” he said to himself, feeling\\nconsolation in the sense that he had found to which division of\\nregulating principles this new circumstance could be properly referred.\\n\\n“And so,” Alexey Alexandrovitch said to himself, “questions as to her\\nfeelings, and so on, are questions for her conscience, with which I can\\nhave nothing to do. My duty is clearly defined. As the head of the\\nfamily, I am a person bound in duty to guide her, and consequently, in\\npart the person responsible; I am bound to point out the danger I\\nperceive, to warn her, even to use my authority. I ought to speak\\nplainly to her.” And everything that he would say tonight to his wife\\ntook clear shape in Alexey Alexandrovitch’s head. Thinking over what he\\nwould say, he somewhat regretted that he should have to use his time\\nand mental powers for domestic consumption, with so little to show for\\nit, but, in spite of that, the form and contents of the speech before\\nhim shaped itself as clearly and distinctly in his head as a\\nministerial report.\\n\\n“I must say and express fully the following points: first, exposition\\nof the value to be attached to public opinion and to decorum; secondly,\\nexposition of religious significance of marriage; thirdly, if need be,\\nreference to the calamity possibly ensuing to our son; fourthly,\\nreference to the unhappiness likely to result to herself.” And,\\ninterlacing his fingers, Alexey Alexandrovitch stretched them, and the\\njoints of the fingers cracked. This trick, a bad habit, the cracking of\\nhis fingers, always soothed him, and gave precision to his thoughts, so\\nneedful to him at this juncture.\\n\\nThere was the sound of a carriage driving up to the front door. Alexey\\nAlexandrovitch halted in the middle of the room.\\n\\nA woman’s step was heard mounting the stairs. Alexey Alexandrovitch,\\nready for his speech, stood compressing his crossed fingers, waiting to\\nsee if the crack would not come again. One joint cracked.\\n\\nAlready, from the sound of light steps on the stairs, he was aware that\\nshe was close, and though he was satisfied with his speech, he felt\\nfrightened of the explanation confronting him 9\\n\\nAnna came in with hanging head, playing with the tassels of her hood.\\nHer face was brilliant and glowing; but this glow was not one of\\nbrightness; it suggested the fearful glow of a conflagration in the\\nmidst of a dark night. On seeing her husband, Anna raised her head and\\nsmiled, as though she had just waked up.\\n\\n“You’re not in bed? What a wonder!” she said, letting fall her hood,\\nand without stopping, she went on into the dressing-room. “It’s late,\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch,” she said, when she had gone through the\\ndoorway.\\n\\n“Anna, it’s necessary for me to have a talk with you.”\\n\\n“With me?” she said, wonderingly. She came out from behind the door of\\nthe dressing-room, and looked at him. “Why, what is it? What about?”\\nshe asked, sitting down. “Well, let’s talk, if it’s so necessary. But\\nit would be better to get to sleep.”\\n\\nAnna said what came to her lips, and marveled, hearing herself, at her\\nown capacity for lying. How simple and natural were her words, and how\\nlikely that she was simply sleepy! She felt herself clad in an\\nimpenetrable armor of falsehood. She felt that some unseen force had\\ncome to her aid and was supporting her.\\n\\n“Anna, I must warn you,” he began.\\n\\n“Warn me?” she said. “Of what?”\\n\\nShe looked at him so simply, so brightly, that anyone who did not know\\nher as her husband knew her could not have noticed anything unnatural,\\neither in the sound or the sense of her words. But to him, knowing her,\\nknowing that whenever he went to bed five minutes later than usual, she\\nnoticed it, and asked him the reason; to him, knowing that every joy,\\nevery pleasure and pain that she felt she communicated to him at once;\\nto him, now to see that she did not care to notice his state of mind,\\nthat she did not care to say a word about herself, meant a great deal.\\nHe saw that the inmost recesses of her soul, that had always hitherto\\nlain open before him, were closed against him. More than that, he saw\\nfrom her tone that she was not even perturbed at that, but as it were\\nsaid straight out to him: “Yes, it’s shut up, and so it must be, and\\nwill be in future.” Now he experienced a feeling such as a man might\\nhave, returning home and finding his own house locked up. “But perhaps\\nthe key may yet be found,” thought Alexey Alexandrovitch.\\n\\n“I want to warn you,” he said in a low voice, “that through\\nthoughtlessness and lack of caution you may cause yourself to be talked\\nabout in society. Your too animated conversation this evening with\\nCount Vronsky” (he enunciated the name firmly and with deliberate\\nemphasis) “attracted attention.”\\n\\nHe talked and looked at her laughing eyes, which frightened him now\\nwith their impenetrable look, and, as he talked, he felt all the\\nuselessness and idleness of his words.\\n\\n“You’re always like that,” she answered, as though completely\\nmisapprehending him, and of all he had said only taking in the last\\nphrase. “One time you don’t like my being dull, and another time you\\ndon’t like my being lively. I wasn’t dull. Does that offend you?”\\n\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch shivered, and bent his hands to make the joints\\ncrack.\\n\\n“Oh, please, don’t do that, I do so dislike it,” she said.\\n\\n“Anna, is this you?” said Alexey Alexandrovitch, quietly making an\\neffort over himself, and restraining the motion of his fingers.\\n\\n“But what is it all about?” she said, with such genuine and droll\\nwonder. “What do you want of me?”\\n\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch paused, and rubbed his forehead and his eyes. He\\nsaw that instead of doing as he had intended—that is to say, warning\\nhis wife against a mistake in the eyes of the world—he had\\nunconsciously become agitated over what was the affair of her\\nconscience, and was struggling against the barrier he fancied between\\nthem.\\n\\n“This is what I meant to say to you,” he went on coldly and composedly,\\n“and I beg you to listen to it. I consider jealousy, as you know, a\\nhumiliating and degrading feeling, and I shall never allow myself to be\\ninfluenced by it; but there are certain rules of decorum which cannot\\nbe disregarded with impunity. This evening it was not I observed it,\\nbut judging by the impression made on the company, everyone observed\\nthat your conduct and deportment were not altogether what could be\\ndesired.”\\n\\n“I positively don’t understand,” said Anna, shrugging her shoulders—“He\\ndoesn’t care,” she thought. “But other people noticed it, and that’s\\nwhat upsets him.”—“You’re not well, Alexey Alexandrovitch,” she added,\\nand she got up, and would have gone towards the door; but he moved\\nforward as though he would stop her.\\n\\nHis face was ugly and forbidding, as Anna had never seen him. She\\nstopped, and bending her head back and on one side, began with her\\nrapid hand taking out her hairpins.\\n\\n“Well, I’m listening to what’s to come,” she said, calmly and\\nironically; “and indeed I listen with interest, for I should like to\\nunderstand what’s the matter.”\\n\\nShe spoke, and marveled at the confident, calm, and natural tone in\\nwhich she was speaking, and the choice of the words she used.\\n\\n“To enter into all the details of your feelings I have no right, and\\nbesides, I regard that as useless and even harmful,” began Alexey\\nAlexandrovitch. “Ferreting in one’s soul, one often ferrets out\\nsomething that might have lain there unnoticed. Your feelings are an\\naffair of your own conscience; but I am in duty bound to you, to\\nmyself, and to God, to point out to you your duties. Our life has been\\njoined, not by man, but by God. That union can only be severed by a\\ncrime, and a crime of that nature brings its own chastisement.”\\n\\n“I don’t understand a word. And, oh dear! how sleepy I am, unluckily,”\\nshe said, rapidly passing her hand through her hair, feeling for the\\nremaining hairpins.\\n\\n“Anna, for God’s sake don’t speak like that!” he said gently. “Perhaps\\nI am mistaken, but believe me, what I say, I say as much for myself as\\nfor you. I am your husband, and I love you.”\\n\\nFor an instant her face fell, and the mocking gleam in her eyes died\\naway; but the word _love_ threw her into revolt again. She thought:\\n“Love? Can he love? If he hadn’t heard there was such a thing as love,\\nhe would never have used the word. He doesn’t even know what love is.”\\n\\n“Alexey Alexandrovitch, really I don’t understand,” she said. “Define\\nwhat it is you find....”\\n\\n“Pardon, let me say all I have to say. I love you. But I am not\\nspeaking of myself; the most important persons in this matter are our\\nson and yourself. It may very well be, I repeat, that my words seem to\\nyou utterly unnecessary and out of place; it may be that they are\\ncalled forth by my mistaken impression. In that case, I beg you to\\nforgive me. But if you are conscious yourself of even the smallest\\nfoundation for them, then I beg you to think a little, and if your\\nheart prompts you, to speak out to me....”\\n\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch was unconsciously saying something utterly unlike\\nwhat he had prepared.\\n\\n“I have nothing to say. And besides,” she said hurriedly, with\\ndifficulty repressing a smile, “it’s really time to be in bed.”\\n\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch sighed, and, without saying more, went into the\\nbedroom.\\n\\nWhen she came into the bedroom, he was already in bed. His lips were\\nsternly compressed, and his eyes looked away from her. Anna got into\\nher bed, and lay expecting every minute that he would begin to speak to\\nher again. She both feared his speaking and wished for it. But he was\\nsilent. She waited for a long while without moving, and had forgotten\\nabout him. She thought of that other; she pictured him, and felt how\\nher heart was flooded with emotion and guilty delight at the thought of\\nhim. Suddenly she heard an even, tranquil snore. For the first instant\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch seemed, as it were, appalled at his own snoring,\\nand ceased; but after an interval of two breathings the snore sounded\\nagain, with a new tranquil rhythm.\\n\\n“It’s late, it’s late,” she whispered with a smile. A long while she\\nlay, not moving, with open eyes, whose brilliance she almost fancied\\nshe could herself see in the darkness 10\\n\\nFrom that time a new life began for Alexey Alexandrovitch and for his\\nwife. Nothing special happened. Anna went out into society, as she had\\nalways done, was particularly often at Princess Betsy’s, and met\\nVronsky everywhere. Alexey Alexandrovitch saw this, but could do\\nnothing. All his efforts to draw her into open discussion she\\nconfronted with a barrier which he could not penetrate, made up of a\\nsort of amused perplexity. Outwardly everything was the same, but their\\ninner relations were completely changed. Alexey Alexandrovitch, a man\\nof great power in the world of politics, felt himself helpless in this.\\nLike an ox with head bent, submissively he awaited the blow which he\\nfelt was lifted over him. Every time he began to think about it, he\\nfelt that he must try once more, that by kindness, tenderness, and\\npersuasion there was still hope of saving her, of bringing her back to\\nherself, and every day he made ready to talk to her. But every time he\\nbegan talking to her, he felt that the spirit of evil and deceit, which\\nhad taken possession of her, had possession of him too, and he talked\\nto her in a tone quite unlike that in which he had meant to talk.\\nInvoluntarily he talked to her in his habitual tone of jeering at\\nanyone who should say what he was saying. And in that tone it was\\nimpossible to say what needed to be said to her 11\\n\\nThat which for Vronsky had been almost a whole year the one absorbing\\ndesire of his life, replacing all his old desires; that which for Anna\\nhad been an impossible, terrible, and even for that reason more\\nentrancing dream of bliss, that desire had been fulfilled. He stood\\nbefore her, pale, his lower jaw quivering, and besought her to be calm,\\nnot knowing how or why.\\n\\n“Anna! Anna!” he said with a choking voice, “Anna, for pity’s sake!...”\\n\\nBut the louder he spoke, the lower she dropped her once proud and gay,\\nnow shame-stricken head, and she bowed down and sank from the sofa\\nwhere she was sitting, down on the floor, at his feet; she would have\\nfallen on the carpet if he had not held her.\\n\\n“My God! Forgive me!” she said, sobbing, pressing his hands to her\\nbosom.\\n\\nShe felt so sinful, so guilty, that nothing was left her but to\\nhumiliate herself and beg forgiveness; and as now there was no one in\\nher life but him, to him she addressed her prayer for forgiveness.\\nLooking at him, she had a physical sense of her humiliation, and she\\ncould say nothing more. He felt what a murderer must feel, when he sees\\nthe body he has robbed of life. That body, robbed by him of life, was\\ntheir love, the first stage of their love. There was something awful\\nand revolting in the memory of what had been bought at this fearful\\nprice of shame. Shame at their spiritual nakedness crushed her and\\ninfected him. But in spite of all the murderer’s horror before the body\\nof his victim, he must hack it to pieces, hide the body, must use what\\nhe has gained by his murder.\\n\\nAnd with fury, as it were with passion, the murderer falls on the body,\\nand drags it and hacks at it; so he covered her face and shoulders with\\nkisses. She held his hand, and did not stir. “Yes, these kisses—that is\\nwhat has been bought by this shame. Yes, and one hand, which will\\nalways be mine—the hand of my accomplice.” She lifted up that hand and\\nkissed it. He sank on his knees and tried to see her face; but she hid\\nit, and said nothing. At last, as though making an effort over herself,\\nshe got up and pushed him away. Her face was still as beautiful, but it\\nwas only the more pitiful for that.\\n\\n“All is over,” she said; “I have nothing but you. Remember that.”\\n\\n“I can never forget what is my whole life. For one instant of this\\nhappiness....”\\n\\n“Happiness!” she said with horror and loathing and her horror\\nunconsciously infected him. “For pity’s sake, not a word, not a word\\nmore.”\\n\\nShe rose quickly and moved away from him.\\n\\n“Not a word more,” she repeated, and with a look of chill despair,\\nincomprehensible to him, she parted from him. She felt that at that\\nmoment she could not put into words the sense of shame, of rapture, and\\nof horror at this stepping into a new life, and she did not want to\\nspeak of it, to vulgarize this feeling by inappropriate words. But\\nlater too, and the next day and the third day, she still found no words\\nin which she could express the complexity of her feelings; indeed, she\\ncould not even find thoughts in which she could clearly think out all\\nthat was in her soul.\\n\\nShe said to herself: “No, just now I can’t think of it, later on, when\\nI am calmer.” But this calm for thought never came; every time the\\nthought rose of what she had done and what would happen to her, and\\nwhat she ought to do, a horror came over her and she drove those\\nthoughts away.\\n\\n“Later, later,” she said—“when I am calmer.”\\n\\nBut in dreams, when she had no control over her thoughts, her position\\npresented itself to her in all its hideous nakedness. One dream haunted\\nher almost every night. She dreamed that both were her husbands at\\nonce, that both were lavishing caresses on her. Alexey Alexandrovitch\\nwas weeping, kissing her hands, and saying, “How happy we are now!” And\\nAlexey Vronsky was there too, and he too was her husband. And she was\\nmarveling that it had once seemed impossible to her, was explaining to\\nthem, laughing, that this was ever so much simpler, and that now both\\nof them were happy and contented. But this dream weighed on her like a\\nnightmare, and she awoke from it in terror 12\\n\\nIn the early days after his return from Moscow, whenever Levin\\nshuddered and grew red, remembering the disgrace of his rejection, he\\nsaid to himself: “This was just how I used to shudder and blush,\\nthinking myself utterly lost, when I was plucked in physics and did not\\nget my remove; and how I thought myself utterly ruined after I had\\nmismanaged that affair of my sister’s that was entrusted to me. And\\nyet, now that years have passed, I recall it and wonder that it could\\ndistress me so much. It will be the same thing too with this trouble.\\nTime will go by and I shall not mind about this either.”\\n\\nBut three months had passed and he had not left off minding about it;\\nand it was as painful for him to think of it as it had been those first\\ndays. He could not be at peace because after dreaming so long of family\\nlife, and feeling himself so ripe for it, he was still not married, and\\nwas further than ever from marriage. He was painfully conscious\\nhimself, as were all about him, that at his years it is not well for\\nman to be alone. He remembered how before starting for Moscow he had\\nonce said to his cowman Nikolay, a simple-hearted peasant, whom he\\nliked talking to: “Well, Nikolay! I mean to get married,” and how\\nNikolay had promptly answered, as of a matter on which there could be\\nno possible doubt: “And high time too, Konstantin Dmitrievitch.” But\\nmarriage had now become further off than ever. The place was taken, and\\nwhenever he tried to imagine any of the girls he knew in that place, he\\nfelt that it was utterly impossible. Moreover, the recollection of the\\nrejection and the part he had played in the affair tortured him with\\nshame. However often he told himself that he was in no wise to blame in\\nit, that recollection, like other humiliating reminiscences of a\\nsimilar kind, made him twinge and blush. There had been in his past, as\\nin every man’s, actions, recognized by him as bad, for which his\\nconscience ought to have tormented him; but the memory of these evil\\nactions was far from causing him so much suffering as those trivial but\\nhumiliating reminiscences. These wounds never healed. And with these\\nmemories was now ranged his rejection and the pitiful position in which\\nhe must have appeared to others that evening. But time and work did\\ntheir part. Bitter memories were more and more covered up by the\\nincidents—paltry in his eyes, but really important—of his country life.\\nEvery week he thought less often of Kitty. He was impatiently looking\\nforward to the news that she was married, or just going to be married,\\nhoping that such news would, like having a tooth out, completely cure\\nhim.\\n\\nMeanwhile spring came on, beautiful and kindly, without the delays and\\ntreacheries of spring,—one of those rare springs in which plants,\\nbeasts, and man rejoice alike. This lovely spring roused Levin still\\nmore, and strengthened him in his resolution of renouncing all his past\\nand building up his lonely life firmly and independently. Though many\\nof the plans with which he had returned to the country had not been\\ncarried out, still his most important resolution—that of purity—had\\nbeen kept by him. He was free from that shame, which had usually\\nharassed him after a fall; and he could look everyone straight in the\\nface. In February he had received a letter from Marya Nikolaevna\\ntelling him that his brother Nikolay’s health was getting worse, but\\nthat he would not take advice, and in consequence of this letter Levin\\nwent to Moscow to his brother’s and succeeded in persuading him to see\\na doctor and to go to a watering-place abroad. He succeeded so well in\\npersuading his brother, and in lending him money for the journey\\nwithout irritating him, that he was satisfied with himself in that\\nmatter. In addition to his farming, which called for special attention\\nin spring, and in addition to reading, Levin had begun that winter a\\nwork on agriculture, the plan of which turned on taking into account\\nthe character of the laborer on the land as one of the unalterable data\\nof the question, like the climate and the soil, and consequently\\ndeducing all the principles of scientific culture, not simply from the\\ndata of soil and climate, but from the data of soil, climate, and a\\ncertain unalterable character of the laborer. Thus, in spite of his\\nsolitude, or in consequence of his solitude, his life was exceedingly\\nfull. Only rarely he suffered from an unsatisfied desire to communicate\\nhis stray ideas to someone besides Agafea Mihalovna. With her indeed he\\nnot infrequently fell into discussion upon physics, the theory of\\nagriculture, and especially philosophy; philosophy was Agafea\\nMihalovna’s favorite subject.\\n\\nSpring was slow in unfolding. For the last few weeks it had been\\nsteadily fine frosty weather. In the daytime it thawed in the sun, but\\nat night there were even seven degrees of frost. There was such a\\nfrozen surface on the snow that they drove the wagons anywhere off the\\nroads. Easter came in the snow. Then all of a sudden, on Easter Monday,\\na warm wind sprang up, storm clouds swooped down, and for three days\\nand three nights the warm, driving rain fell in streams. On Thursday\\nthe wind dropped, and a thick gray fog brooded over the land as though\\nhiding the mysteries of the transformations that were being wrought in\\nnature. Behind the fog there was the flowing of water, the cracking and\\nfloating of ice, the swift rush of turbid, foaming torrents; and on the\\nfollowing Monday, in the evening, the fog parted, the storm clouds\\nsplit up into little curling crests of cloud, the sky cleared, and the\\nreal spring had come. In the morning the sun rose brilliant and quickly\\nwore away the thin layer of ice that covered the water, and all the\\nwarm air was quivering with the steam that rose up from the quickened\\nearth. The old grass looked greener, and the young grass thrust up its\\ntiny blades; the buds of the guelder-rose and of the currant and the\\nsticky birch-buds were swollen with sap, and an exploring bee was\\nhumming about the golden blossoms that studded the willow. Larks\\ntrilled unseen above the velvety green fields and the ice-covered\\nstubble-land; peewits wailed over the low lands and marshes flooded by\\nthe pools; cranes and wild geese flew high across the sky uttering\\ntheir spring calls. The cattle, bald in patches where the new hair had\\nnot grown yet, lowed in the pastures; the bowlegged lambs frisked round\\ntheir bleating mothers. Nimble children ran about the drying paths,\\ncovered with the prints of bare feet. There was a merry chatter of\\npeasant women over their linen at the pond, and the ring of axes in the\\nyard, where the peasants were repairing ploughs and harrows. The real\\nspring had come 13\\n\\nLevin put on his big boots, and, for the first time, a cloth jacket,\\ninstead of his fur cloak, and went out to look after his farm, stepping\\nover streams of water that flashed in the sunshine and dazzled his\\neyes, and treading one minute on ice and the next into sticky mud.\\n\\nSpring is the time of plans and projects. And, as he came out into the\\nfarmyard, Levin, like a tree in spring that knows not what form will be\\ntaken by the young shoots and twigs imprisoned in its swelling buds,\\nhardly knew what undertakings he was going to begin upon now in the\\nfarm work that was so dear to him. But he felt that he was full of the\\nmost splendid plans and projects. First of all he went to the cattle.\\nThe cows had been let out into their paddock, and their smooth sides\\nwere already shining with their new, sleek, spring coats; they basked\\nin the sunshine and lowed to go to the meadow. Levin gazed admiringly\\nat the cows he knew so intimately to the minutest detail of their\\ncondition, and gave orders for them to be driven out into the meadow,\\nand the calves to be let into the paddock. The herdsman ran gaily to\\nget ready for the meadow. The cowherd girls, picking up their\\npetticoats, ran splashing through the mud with bare legs, still white,\\nnot yet brown from the sun, waving brush wood in their hands, chasing\\nthe calves that frolicked in the mirth of spring.\\n\\nAfter admiring the young ones of that year, who were particularly\\nfine—the early calves were the size of a peasant’s cow, and Pava’s\\ndaughter, at three months old, was as big as a yearling—Levin gave\\norders for a trough to be brought out and for them to be fed in the\\npaddock. But it appeared that as the paddock had not been used during\\nthe winter, the hurdles made in the autumn for it were broken. He sent\\nfor the carpenter, who, according to his orders, ought to have been at\\nwork at the thrashing machine. But it appeared that the carpenter was\\nrepairing the harrows, which ought to have been repaired before Lent.\\nThis was very annoying to Levin. It was annoying to come upon that\\neverlasting slovenliness in the farm work against which he had been\\nstriving with all his might for so many years. The hurdles, as he\\nascertained, being not wanted in winter, had been carried to the\\ncart-horses’ stable; and there broken, as they were of light\\nconstruction, only meant for feeding calves. Moreover, it was apparent\\nalso that the harrows and all the agricultural implements, which he had\\ndirected to be looked over and repaired in the winter, for which very\\npurpose he had hired three carpenters, had not been put into repair,\\nand the harrows were being repaired when they ought to have been\\nharrowing the field. Levin sent for his bailiff, but immediately went\\noff himself to look for him. The bailiff, beaming all over, like\\neveryone that day, in a sheepskin bordered with astrachan, came out of\\nthe barn, twisting a bit of straw in his hands.\\n\\n“Why isn’t the carpenter at the thrashing machine?”\\n\\n“Oh, I meant to tell you yesterday, the harrows want repairing. Here\\nit’s time they got to work in the fields.”\\n\\n“But what were they doing in the winter, then?”\\n\\n“But what did you want the carpenter for?”\\n\\n“Where are the hurdles for the calves’ paddock?”\\n\\n“I ordered them to be got ready. What would you have with those\\npeasants!” said the bailiff, with a wave of his hand.\\n\\n“It’s not those peasants but this bailiff!” said Levin, getting angry.\\n“Why, what do I keep you for?” he cried. But, bethinking himself that\\nthis would not help matters, he stopped short in the middle of a\\nsentence, and merely sighed. “Well, what do you say? Can sowing begin?”\\nhe asked, after a pause.\\n\\n“Behind Turkin tomorrow or the next day they might begin.”\\n\\n“And the clover?”\\n\\n“I’ve sent Vassily and Mishka; they’re sowing. Only I don’t know if\\nthey’ll manage to get through; it’s so slushy.”\\n\\n“How many acres?”\\n\\n“About fifteen.”\\n\\n“Why not sow all?” cried Levin.\\n\\nThat they were only sowing the clover on fifteen acres, not on all the\\nforty-five, was still more annoying to him. Clover, as he knew, both\\nfrom books and from his own experience, never did well except when it\\nwas sown as early as possible, almost in the snow. And yet Levin could\\nnever get this done.\\n\\n“There’s no one to send. What would you have with such a set of\\npeasants? Three haven’t turned up. And there’s Semyon....”\\n\\n“Well, you should have taken some men from the thatching.”\\n\\n“And so I have, as it is.”\\n\\n“Where are the peasants, then?”\\n\\n“Five are making compôte” (which meant compost), “four are shifting the\\noats for fear of a touch of mildew, Konstantin Dmitrievitch.”\\n\\nLevin knew very well that “a touch of mildew” meant that his English\\nseed oats were already ruined. Again they had not done as he had\\nordered.\\n\\n“Why, but I told you during Lent to put in pipes,” he cried.\\n\\n“Don’t put yourself out; we shall get it all done in time.”\\n\\nLevin waved his hand angrily, went into the granary to glance at the\\noats, and then to the stable. The oats were not yet spoiled. But the\\npeasants were carrying the oats in spades when they might simply let\\nthem slide down into the lower granary; and arranging for this to be\\ndone, and taking two workmen from there for sowing clover, Levin got\\nover his vexation with the bailiff. Indeed, it was such a lovely day\\nthat one could not be angry.\\n\\n“Ignat!” he called to the coachman, who, with his sleeves tucked up,\\nwas washing the carriage wheels, “saddle me....”\\n\\n“Which, sir?”\\n\\n“Well, let it be Kolpik.”\\n\\n“Yes, sir.”\\n\\nWhile they were saddling his horse, Levin again called up the bailiff,\\nwho was hanging about in sight, to make it up with him, and began\\ntalking to him about the spring operations before them, and his plans\\nfor the farm.\\n\\nThe wagons were to begin carting manure earlier, so as to get all done\\nbefore the early mowing. And the ploughing of the further land to go on\\nwithout a break so as to let it ripen lying fallow. And the mowing to\\nbe all done by hired labor, not on half-profits. The bailiff listened\\nattentively, and obviously made an effort to approve of his employer’s\\nprojects. But still he had that look Levin knew so well that always\\nirritated him, a look of hopelessness and despondency. That look said:\\n“That’s all very well, but as God wills.”\\n\\nNothing mortified Levin so much as that tone. But it was the tone\\ncommon to all the bailiffs he had ever had. They had all taken up that\\nattitude to his plans, and so now he was not angered by it, but\\nmortified, and felt all the more roused to struggle against this, as it\\nseemed, elemental force continually ranged against him, for which he\\ncould find no other expression than “as God wills.”\\n\\n“If we can manage it, Konstantin Dmitrievitch,” said the bailiff.\\n\\n“Why ever shouldn’t you manage it?”\\n\\n“We positively must have another fifteen laborers. And they don’t turn\\nup. There were some here today asking seventy roubles for the summer.”\\n\\nLevin was silent. Again he was brought face to face with that opposing\\nforce. He knew that however much they tried, they could not hire more\\nthan forty—thirty-seven perhaps or thirty-eight—laborers for a\\nreasonable sum. Some forty had been taken on, and there were no more.\\nBut still he could not help struggling against it.\\n\\n“Send to Sury, to Tchefirovka; if they don’t come we must look for\\nthem.”\\n\\n“Oh, I’ll send, to be sure,” said Vassily Fedorovitch despondently.\\n“But there are the horses, too, they’re not good for much.”\\n\\n“We’ll get some more. I know, of course,” Levin added laughing, “you\\nalways want to do with as little and as poor quality as possible; but\\nthis year I’m not going to let you have things your own way. I’ll see\\nto everything myself.”\\n\\n“Why, I don’t think you take much rest as it is. It cheers us up to\\nwork under the master’s eye....”\\n\\n“So they’re sowing clover behind the Birch Dale? I’ll go and have a\\nlook at them,” he said, getting on to the little bay cob, Kolpik, who\\nwas led up by the coachman.\\n\\n“You can’t get across the streams, Konstantin Dmitrievitch,” the\\ncoachman shouted.\\n\\n“All right, I’ll go by the forest.”\\n\\nAnd Levin rode through the slush of the farmyard to the gate and out\\ninto the open country, his good little horse, after his long\\ninactivity, stepping out gallantly, snorting over the pools, and\\nasking, as it were, for guidance. If Levin had felt happy before in the\\ncattle pens and farmyard, he felt happier yet in the open country.\\nSwaying rhythmically with the ambling paces of his good little cob,\\ndrinking in the warm yet fresh scent of the snow and the air, as he\\nrode through his forest over the crumbling, wasted snow, still left in\\nparts, and covered with dissolving tracks, he rejoiced over every tree,\\nwith the moss reviving on its bark and the buds swelling on its shoots.\\nWhen he came out of the forest, in the immense plain before him, his\\ngrass fields stretched in an unbroken carpet of green, without one bare\\nplace or swamp, only spotted here and there in the hollows with patches\\nof melting snow. He was not put out of temper even by the sight of the\\npeasants’ horses and colts trampling down his young grass (he told a\\npeasant he met to drive them out), nor by the sarcastic and stupid\\nreply of the peasant Ipat, whom he met on the way, and asked, “Well,\\nIpat, shall we soon be sowing?” “We must get the ploughing done first,\\nKonstantin Dmitrievitch,” answered Ipat. The further he rode, the\\nhappier he became, and plans for the land rose to his mind each better\\nthan the last; to plant all his fields with hedges along the southern\\nborders, so that the snow should not lie under them; to divide them up\\ninto six fields of arable and three of pasture and hay; to build a\\ncattle yard at the further end of the estate, and to dig a pond and to\\nconstruct movable pens for the cattle as a means of manuring the land.\\nAnd then eight hundred acres of wheat, three hundred of potatoes, and\\nfour hundred of clover, and not one acre exhausted.\\n\\nAbsorbed in such dreams, carefully keeping his horse by the hedges, so\\nas not to trample his young crops, he rode up to the laborers who had\\nbeen sent to sow clover. A cart with the seed in it was standing, not\\nat the edge, but in the middle of the crop, and the winter corn had\\nbeen torn up by the wheels and trampled by the horse. Both the laborers\\nwere sitting in the hedge, probably smoking a pipe together. The earth\\nin the cart, with which the seed was mixed, was not crushed to powder,\\nbut crusted together or adhering in clods. Seeing the master, the\\nlaborer, Vassily, went towards the cart, while Mishka set to work\\nsowing. This was not as it should be, but with the laborers Levin\\nseldom lost his temper. When Vassily came up, Levin told him to lead\\nthe horse to the hedge.\\n\\n“It’s all right, sir, it’ll spring up again,” responded Vassily.\\n\\n“Please don’t argue,” said Levin, “but do as you’re told.”\\n\\n“Yes, sir,” answered Vassily, and he took the horse’s head. “What a\\nsowing, Konstantin Dmitrievitch,” he said, hesitating; “first rate.\\nOnly it’s a work to get about! You drag a ton of earth on your shoes.”\\n\\n“Why is it you have earth that’s not sifted?” said Levin.\\n\\n“Well, we crumble it up,” answered Vassily, taking up some seed and\\nrolling the earth in his palms.\\n\\nVassily was not to blame for their having filled up his cart with\\nunsifted earth, but still it was annoying.\\n\\nLevin had more than once already tried a way he knew for stifling his\\nanger, and turning all that seemed dark right again, and he tried that\\nway now. He watched how Mishka strode along, swinging the huge clods of\\nearth that clung to each foot; and getting off his horse, he took the\\nsieve from Vassily and started sowing himself.\\n\\n“Where did you stop?”\\n\\nVassily pointed to the mark with his foot, and Levin went forward as\\nbest he could, scattering the seed on the land. Walking was as\\ndifficult as on a bog, and by the time Levin had ended the row he was\\nin a great heat, and he stopped and gave up the sieve to Vassily.\\n\\n“Well, master, when summer’s here, mind you don’t scold me for these\\nrows,” said Vassily.\\n\\n“Eh?” said Levin cheerily, already feeling the effect of his method.\\n\\n“Why, you’ll see in the summer time. It’ll look different. Look you\\nwhere I sowed last spring. How I did work at it! I do my best,\\nKonstantin Dmitrievitch, d’ye see, as I would for my own father. I\\ndon’t like bad work myself, nor would I let another man do it. What’s\\ngood for the master’s good for us too. To look out yonder now,” said\\nVassily, pointing, “it does one’s heart good.”\\n\\n“It’s a lovely spring, Vassily.”\\n\\n“Why, it’s a spring such as the old men don’t remember the like of. I\\nwas up home; an old man up there has sown wheat too, about an acre of\\nit. He was saying you wouldn’t know it from rye.”\\n\\n“Have you been sowing wheat long?”\\n\\n“Why, sir, it was you taught us the year before last. You gave me two\\nmeasures. We sold about eight bushels and sowed a rood.”\\n\\n“Well, mind you crumble up the clods,” said Levin, going towards his\\nhorse, “and keep an eye on Mishka. And if there’s a good crop you shall\\nhave half a rouble for every acre.”\\n\\n“Humbly thankful. We are very well content, sir, as it is.”\\n\\nLevin got on his horse and rode towards the field where was last year’s\\nclover, and the one which was ploughed ready for the spring corn.\\n\\nThe crop of clover coming up in the stubble was magnificent. It had\\nsurvived everything, and stood up vividly green through the broken\\nstalks of last year’s wheat. The horse sank in up to the pasterns, and\\nhe drew each hoof with a sucking sound out of the half-thawed ground.\\nOver the ploughland riding was utterly impossible; the horse could only\\nkeep a foothold where there was ice, and in the thawing furrows he sank\\ndeep in at each step. The ploughland was in splendid condition; in a\\ncouple of days it would be fit for harrowing and sowing. Everything was\\ncapital, everything was cheering. Levin rode back across the streams,\\nhoping the water would have gone down. And he did in fact get across,\\nand startled two ducks. “There must be snipe too,” he thought, and just\\nas he reached the turning homewards he met the forest keeper, who\\nconfirmed his theory about the snipe.\\n\\nLevin went home at a trot, so as to have time to eat his dinner and get\\nhis gun ready for the evening 14\\n\\nAs he rode up to the house in the happiest frame of mind, Levin heard\\nthe bell ring at the side of the principal entrance of the house.\\n\\n“Yes, that’s someone from the railway station,” he thought, “just the\\ntime to be here from the Moscow train ... Who could it be? What if it’s\\nbrother Nikolay? He did say: ‘Maybe I’ll go to the waters, or maybe\\nI’ll come down to you.’” He felt dismayed and vexed for the first\\nminute, that his brother Nikolay’s presence should come to disturb his\\nhappy mood of spring. But he felt ashamed of the feeling, and at once\\nhe opened, as it were, the arms of his soul, and with a softened\\nfeeling of joy and expectation, now he hoped with all his heart that it\\nwas his brother. He pricked up his horse, and riding out from behind\\nthe acacias he saw a hired three-horse sledge from the railway station,\\nand a gentleman in a fur coat. It was not his brother. “Oh, if it were\\nonly some nice person one could talk to a little!” he thought.\\n\\n“Ah,” cried Levin joyfully, flinging up both his hands. “Here’s a\\ndelightful visitor! Ah, how glad I am to see you!” he shouted,\\nrecognizing Stepan Arkadyevitch.\\n\\n“I shall find out for certain whether she’s married, or when she’s\\ngoing to be married,” he thought. And on that delicious spring day he\\nfelt that the thought of her did not hurt him at all.\\n\\n“Well, you didn’t expect me, eh?” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, getting out\\nof the sledge, splashed with mud on the bridge of his nose, on his\\ncheek, and on his eyebrows, but radiant with health and good spirits.\\n“I’ve come to see you in the first place,” he said, embracing and\\nkissing him, “to have some stand-shooting second, and to sell the\\nforest at Ergushovo third.”\\n\\n“Delightful! What a spring we’re having! How ever did you get along in\\na sledge?”\\n\\n“In a cart it would have been worse still, Konstantin Dmitrievitch,”\\nanswered the driver, who knew him.\\n\\n“Well, I’m very, very glad to see you,” said Levin, with a genuine\\nsmile of childlike delight.\\n\\nLevin led his friend to the room set apart for visitors, where Stepan\\nArkadyevitch’s things were carried also—a bag, a gun in a case, a\\nsatchel for cigars. Leaving him there to wash and change his clothes,\\nLevin went off to the counting house to speak about the ploughing and\\nclover. Agafea Mihalovna, always very anxious for the credit of the\\nhouse, met him in the hall with inquiries about dinner.\\n\\n“Do just as you like, only let it be as soon as possible,” he said, and\\nwent to the bailiff.\\n\\nWhen he came back, Stepan Arkadyevitch, washed and combed, came out of\\nhis room with a beaming smile, and they went upstairs together.\\n\\n“Well, I am glad I managed to get away to you! Now I shall understand\\nwhat the mysterious business is that you are always absorbed in here.\\nNo, really, I envy you. What a house, how nice it all is! So bright, so\\ncheerful!” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, forgetting that it was not always\\nspring and fine weather like that day. “And your nurse is simply\\ncharming! A pretty maid in an apron might be even more agreeable,\\nperhaps; but for your severe monastic style it does very well.”\\n\\nStepan Arkadyevitch told him many interesting pieces of news;\\nespecially interesting to Levin was the news that his brother, Sergey\\nIvanovitch, was intending to pay him a visit in the summer.\\n\\nNot one word did Stepan Arkadyevitch say in reference to Kitty and the\\nShtcherbatskys; he merely gave him greetings from his wife. Levin was\\ngrateful to him for his delicacy and was very glad of his visitor. As\\nalways happened with him during his solitude, a mass of ideas and\\nfeelings had been accumulating within him, which he could not\\ncommunicate to those about him. And now he poured out upon Stepan\\nArkadyevitch his poetic joy in the spring, and his failures and plans\\nfor the land, and his thoughts and criticisms on the books he had been\\nreading, and the idea of his own book, the basis of which really was,\\nthough he was unaware of it himself, a criticism of all the old books\\non agriculture. Stepan Arkadyevitch, always charming, understanding\\neverything at the slightest reference, was particularly charming on\\nthis visit, and Levin noticed in him a special tenderness, as it were,\\nand a new tone of respect that flattered him.\\n\\nThe efforts of Agafea Mihalovna and the cook, that the dinner should be\\nparticularly good, only ended in the two famished friends attacking the\\npreliminary course, eating a great deal of bread and butter, salt goose\\nand salted mushrooms, and in Levin’s finally ordering the soup to be\\nserved without the accompaniment of little pies, with which the cook\\nhad particularly meant to impress their visitor. But though Stepan\\nArkadyevitch was accustomed to very different dinners, he thought\\neverything excellent: the herb brandy, and the bread, and the butter,\\nand above all the salt goose and the mushrooms, and the nettle soup,\\nand the chicken in white sauce, and the white Crimean wine—everything\\nwas superb and delicious.\\n\\n“Splendid, splendid!” he said, lighting a fat cigar after the roast. “I\\nfeel as if, coming to you, I had landed on a peaceful shore after the\\nnoise and jolting of a steamer. And so you maintain that the laborer\\nhimself is an element to be studied and to regulate the choice of\\nmethods in agriculture. Of course, I’m an ignorant outsider; but I\\nshould fancy theory and its application will have its influence on the\\nlaborer too.”\\n\\n“Yes, but wait a bit. I’m not talking of political economy, I’m talking\\nof the science of agriculture. It ought to be like the natural\\nsciences, and to observe given phenomena and the laborer in his\\neconomic, ethnographical....”\\n\\nAt that instant Agafea Mihalovna came in with jam.\\n\\n“Oh, Agafea Mihalovna,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, kissing the tips of\\nhis plump fingers, “what salt goose, what herb brandy!... What do you\\nthink, isn’t it time to start, Kostya?” he added.\\n\\nLevin looked out of the window at the sun sinking behind the bare\\ntree-tops of the forest.\\n\\n“Yes, it’s time,” he said. “Kouzma, get ready the trap,” and he ran\\ndownstairs.\\n\\nStepan Arkadyevitch, going down, carefully took the canvas cover off\\nhis varnished gun case with his own hands, and opening it, began to get\\nready his expensive new-fashioned gun. Kouzma, who already scented a\\nbig tip, never left Stepan Arkadyevitch’s side, and put on him both his\\nstockings and boots, a task which Stepan Arkadyevitch readily left him.\\n\\n“Kostya, give orders that if the merchant Ryabinin comes ... I told him\\nto come today, he’s to be brought in and to wait for me....”\\n\\n“Why, do you mean to say you’re selling the forest to Ryabinin?”\\n\\n“Yes. Do you know him?”\\n\\n“To be sure I do. I have had to do business with him, ‘positively and\\nconclusively.’”\\n\\nStepan Arkadyevitch laughed. “Positively and conclusively” were the\\nmerchant’s favorite words.\\n\\n“Yes, it’s wonderfully funny the way he talks. She knows where her\\nmaster’s going!” he added, patting Laska, who hung about Levin, whining\\nand licking his hands, his boots, and his gun.\\n\\nThe trap was already at the steps when they went out.\\n\\n“I told them to bring the trap round; or would you rather walk?”\\n\\n“No, we’d better drive,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, getting into the\\ntrap. He sat down, tucked the tiger-skin rug round him, and lighted a\\ncigar. “How is it you don’t smoke? A cigar is a sort of thing, not\\nexactly a pleasure, but the crown and outward sign of pleasure. Come,\\nthis is life! How splendid it is! This is how I should like to live!”\\n\\n“Why, who prevents you?” said Levin, smiling.\\n\\n“No, you’re a lucky man! You’ve got everything you like. You like\\nhorses—and you have them; dogs—you have them; shooting—you have it;\\nfarming—you have it.”\\n\\n“Perhaps because I rejoice in what I have, and don’t fret for what I\\nhaven’t,” said Levin, thinking of Kitty.\\n\\nStepan Arkadyevitch comprehended, looked at him, but said nothing.\\n\\nLevin was grateful to Oblonsky for noticing, with his never-failing\\ntact, that he dreaded conversation about the Shtcherbatskys, and so\\nsaying nothing about them. But now Levin was longing to find out what\\nwas tormenting him so, yet he had not the courage to begin.\\n\\n“Come, tell me how things are going with you,” said Levin, bethinking\\nhimself that it was not nice of him to think only of himself.\\n\\nStepan Arkadyevitch’s eyes sparkled merrily.\\n\\n“You don’t admit, I know, that one can be fond of new rolls when one\\nhas had one’s rations of bread—to your mind it’s a crime; but I don’t\\ncount life as life without love,” he said, taking Levin’s question his\\nown way. “What am I to do? I’m made that way. And really, one does so\\nlittle harm to anyone, and gives oneself so much pleasure....”\\n\\n“What! is there something new, then?” queried Levin.\\n\\n“Yes, my boy, there is! There, do you see, you know the type of\\nOssian’s women.... Women, such as one sees in dreams.... Well, these\\nwomen are sometimes to be met in reality ... and these women are\\nterrible. Woman, don’t you know, is such a subject that however much\\nyou study it, it’s always perfectly new.”\\n\\n“Well, then, it would be better not to study it.”\\n\\n“No. Some mathematician has said that enjoyment lies in the search for\\ntruth, not in the finding it.”\\n\\nLevin listened in silence, and in spite of all the efforts he made, he\\ncould not in the least enter into the feelings of his friend and\\nunderstand his sentiments and the charm of studying such women 15\\n\\nThe place fixed on for the stand-shooting was not far above a stream in\\na little aspen copse. On reaching the copse, Levin got out of the trap\\nand led Oblonsky to a corner of a mossy, swampy glade, already quite\\nfree from snow. He went back himself to a double birch tree on the\\nother side, and leaning his gun on the fork of a dead lower branch, he\\ntook off his full overcoat, fastened his belt again, and worked his\\narms to see if they were free.\\n\\nGray old Laska, who had followed them, sat down warily opposite him and\\npricked up her ears. The sun was setting behind a thick forest, and in\\nthe glow of sunset the birch trees, dotted about in the aspen copse,\\nstood out clearly with their hanging twigs, and their buds swollen\\nalmost to bursting.\\n\\nFrom the thickest parts of the copse, where the snow still remained,\\ncame the faint sound of narrow winding threads of water running away.\\nTiny birds twittered, and now and then fluttered from tree to tree.\\n\\nIn the pauses of complete stillness there came the rustle of last\\nyear’s leaves, stirred by the thawing of the earth and the growth of\\nthe grass.\\n\\n“Imagine! One can hear and see the grass growing!” Levin said to\\nhimself, noticing a wet, slate-colored aspen leaf moving beside a blade\\nof young grass. He stood, listened, and gazed sometimes down at the wet\\nmossy ground, sometimes at Laska listening all alert, sometimes at the\\nsea of bare tree tops that stretched on the slope below him, sometimes\\nat the darkening sky, covered with white streaks of cloud.\\n\\nA hawk flew high over a forest far away with slow sweep of its wings;\\nanother flew with exactly the same motion in the same direction and\\nvanished. The birds twittered more and more loudly and busily in the\\nthicket. An owl hooted not far off, and Laska, starting, stepped\\ncautiously a few steps forward, and putting her head on one side, began\\nto listen intently. Beyond the stream was heard the cuckoo. Twice she\\nuttered her usual cuckoo call, and then gave a hoarse, hurried call and\\nbroke down.\\n\\n“Imagine! the cuckoo already!” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, coming out\\nfrom behind a bush.\\n\\n“Yes, I hear it,” answered Levin, reluctantly breaking the stillness\\nwith his voice, which sounded disagreeable to himself. “Now it’s\\ncoming!”\\n\\nStepan Arkadyevitch’s figure again went behind the bush, and Levin saw\\nnothing but the bright flash of a match, followed by the red glow and\\nblue smoke of a cigarette.\\n\\n“Tchk! tchk!” came the snapping sound of Stepan Arkadyevitch cocking\\nhis gun.\\n\\n“What’s that cry?” asked Oblonsky, drawing Levin’s attention to a\\nprolonged cry, as though a colt were whinnying in a high voice, in\\nplay.\\n\\n“Oh, don’t you know it? That’s the hare. But enough talking! Listen,\\nit’s flying!” almost shrieked Levin, cocking his gun.\\n\\nThey heard a shrill whistle in the distance, and in the exact time, so\\nwell known to the sportsman, two seconds later—another, a third, and\\nafter the third whistle the hoarse, guttural cry could be heard.\\n\\nLevin looked about him to right and to left, and there, just facing him\\nagainst the dusky blue sky above the confused mass of tender shoots of\\nthe aspens, he saw the flying bird. It was flying straight towards him;\\nthe guttural cry, like the even tearing of some strong stuff, sounded\\nclose to his ear; the long beak and neck of the bird could be seen, and\\nat the very instant when Levin was taking aim, behind the bush where\\nOblonsky stood, there was a flash of red lightning: the bird dropped\\nlike an arrow, and darted upwards again. Again came the red flash and\\nthe sound of a blow, and fluttering its wings as though trying to keep\\nup in the air, the bird halted, stopped still an instant, and fell with\\na heavy splash on the slushy ground.\\n\\n“Can I have missed it?” shouted Stepan Arkadyevitch, who could not see\\nfor the smoke.\\n\\n“Here it is!” said Levin, pointing to Laska, who with one ear raised,\\nwagging the end of her shaggy tail, came slowly back as though she\\nwould prolong the pleasure, and as it were smiling, brought the dead\\nbird to her master. “Well, I’m glad you were successful,” said Levin,\\nwho, at the same time, had a sense of envy that he had not succeeded in\\nshooting the snipe.\\n\\n“It was a bad shot from the right barrel,” responded Stepan\\nArkadyevitch, loading his gun. “Sh... it’s flying!”\\n\\nThe shrill whistles rapidly following one another were heard again. Two\\nsnipe, playing and chasing one another, and only whistling, not crying,\\nflew straight at the very heads of the sportsmen. There was the report\\nof four shots, and like swallows the snipe turned swift somersaults in\\nthe air and vanished from sight.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe stand-shooting was capital. Stepan Arkadyevitch shot two more birds\\nand Levin two, of which one was not found. It began to get dark. Venus,\\nbright and silvery, shone with her soft light low down in the west\\nbehind the birch trees, and high up in the east twinkled the red lights\\nof Arcturus. Over his head Levin made out the stars of the Great Bear\\nand lost them again. The snipe had ceased flying; but Levin resolved to\\nstay a little longer, till Venus, which he saw below a branch of birch,\\nshould be above it, and the stars of the Great Bear should be perfectly\\nplain. Venus had risen above the branch, and the ear of the Great Bear\\nwith its shaft was now all plainly visible against the dark blue sky,\\nyet still he waited.\\n\\n“Isn’t it time to go home?” said Stepan Arkadyevitch.\\n\\nIt was quite still now in the copse, and not a bird was stirring.\\n\\n“Let’s stay a little while,” answered Levin.\\n\\n“As you like.”\\n\\nThey were standing now about fifteen paces from one another.\\n\\n“Stiva!” said Levin unexpectedly; “how is it you don’t tell me whether\\nyour sister-in-law’s married yet, or when she’s going to be?”\\n\\nLevin felt so resolute and serene that no answer, he fancied, could\\naffect him. But he had never dreamed of what Stepan Arkadyevitch\\nreplied.\\n\\n“She’s never thought of being married, and isn’t thinking of it; but\\nshe’s very ill, and the doctors have sent her abroad. They’re\\npositively afraid she may not live.”\\n\\n“What!” cried Levin. “Very ill? What is wrong with her? How has\\nshe...?”\\n\\nWhile they were saying this, Laska, with ears pricked up, was looking\\nupwards at the sky, and reproachfully at them.\\n\\n“They have chosen a time to talk,” she was thinking. “It’s on the\\nwing.... Here it is, yes, it is. They’ll miss it,” thought Laska.\\n\\nBut at that very instant both suddenly heard a shrill whistle which, as\\nit were, smote on their ears, and both suddenly seized their guns and\\ntwo flashes gleamed, and two bangs sounded at the very same instant.\\nThe snipe flying high above instantly folded its wings and fell into a\\nthicket, bending down the delicate shoots.\\n\\n“Splendid! Together!” cried Levin, and he ran with Laska into the\\nthicket to look for the snipe.\\n\\n“Oh, yes, what was it that was unpleasant?” he wondered. “Yes, Kitty’s\\nill.... Well, it can’t be helped; I’m very sorry,” he thought.\\n\\n“She’s found it! Isn’t she a clever thing?” he said, taking the warm\\nbird from Laska’s mouth and packing it into the almost full game bag.\\n“I’ve got it, Stiva!” he shouted 16\\n\\nOn the way home Levin asked all details of Kitty’s illness and the\\nShtcherbatskys’ plans, and though he would have been ashamed to admit\\nit, he was pleased at what he heard. He was pleased that there was\\nstill hope, and still more pleased that she should be suffering who had\\nmade him suffer so much. But when Stepan Arkadyevitch began to speak of\\nthe causes of Kitty’s illness, and mentioned Vronsky’s name, Levin cut\\nhim short.\\n\\n“I have no right whatever to know family matters, and, to tell the\\ntruth, no interest in them either.”\\n\\nStepan Arkadyevitch smiled hardly perceptibly, catching the\\ninstantaneous change he knew so well in Levin’s face, which had become\\nas gloomy as it had been bright a minute before.\\n\\n“Have you quite settled about the forest with Ryabinin?” asked Levin.\\n\\n“Yes, it’s settled. The price is magnificent; thirty-eight thousand.\\nEight straight away, and the rest in six years. I’ve been bothering\\nabout it for ever so long. No one would give more.”\\n\\n“Then you’ve as good as given away your forest for nothing,” said Levin\\ngloomily.\\n\\n“How do you mean for nothing?” said Stepan Arkadyevitch with a\\ngood-humored smile, knowing that nothing would be right in Levin’s eyes\\nnow.\\n\\n“Because the forest is worth at least a hundred and fifty roubles the\\nacre,” answered Levin.\\n\\n“Oh, these farmers!” said Stepan Arkadyevitch playfully. “Your tone of\\ncontempt for us poor townsfolk!... But when it comes to business, we do\\nit better than anyone. I assure you I have reckoned it all out,” he\\nsaid, “and the forest is fetching a very good price—so much so that I’m\\nafraid of this fellow’s crying off, in fact. You know it’s not\\n‘timber,’” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, hoping by this distinction to\\nconvince Levin completely of the unfairness of his doubts. “And it\\nwon’t run to more than twenty-five yards of fagots per acre, and he’s\\ngiving me at the rate of seventy roubles the acre.”\\n\\nLevin smiled contemptuously. “I know,” he thought, “that fashion not\\nonly in him, but in all city people, who, after being twice in ten\\nyears in the country, pick up two or three phrases and use them in\\nseason and out of season, firmly persuaded that they know all about it.\\n‘_Timber, run to so many yards the acre._’ He says those words without\\nunderstanding them himself.”\\n\\n“I wouldn’t attempt to teach you what you write about in your office,”\\nsaid he, “and if need arose, I should come to you to ask about it. But\\nyou’re so positive you know all the lore of the forest. It’s difficult.\\nHave you counted the trees?”\\n\\n“How count the trees?” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, laughing, still trying\\nto draw his friend out of his ill-temper. “Count the sands of the sea,\\nnumber the stars. Some higher power might do it.”\\n\\n“Oh, well, the higher power of Ryabinin can. Not a single merchant ever\\nbuys a forest without counting the trees, unless they get it given them\\nfor nothing, as you’re doing now. I know your forest. I go there every\\nyear shooting, and your forest’s worth a hundred and fifty roubles an\\nacre paid down, while he’s giving you sixty by installments. So that in\\nfact you’re making him a present of thirty thousand.”\\n\\n“Come, don’t let your imagination run away with you,” said Stepan\\nArkadyevitch piteously. “Why was it none would give it, then?”\\n\\n“Why, because he has an understanding with the merchants; he’s bought\\nthem off. I’ve had to do with all of them; I know them. They’re not\\nmerchants, you know: they’re speculators. He wouldn’t look at a bargain\\nthat gave him ten, fifteen per cent. profit, but holds back to buy a\\nrouble’s worth for twenty kopecks.”\\n\\n“Well, enough of it! You’re out of temper.”\\n\\n“Not the least,” said Levin gloomily, as they drove up to the house.\\n\\nAt the steps there stood a trap tightly covered with iron and leather,\\nwith a sleek horse tightly harnessed with broad collar-straps. In the\\ntrap sat the chubby, tightly belted clerk who served Ryabinin as\\ncoachman. Ryabinin himself was already in the house, and met the\\nfriends in the hall. Ryabinin was a tall, thinnish, middle-aged man,\\nwith mustache and a projecting clean-shaven chin, and prominent\\nmuddy-looking eyes. He was dressed in a long-skirted blue coat, with\\nbuttons below the waist at the back, and wore high boots wrinkled over\\nthe ankles and straight over the calf, with big galoshes drawn over\\nthem. He rubbed his face with his handkerchief, and wrapping round him\\nhis coat, which sat extremely well as it was, he greeted them with a\\nsmile, holding out his hand to Stepan Arkadyevitch, as though he wanted\\nto catch something.\\n\\n“So here you are,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, giving him his hand.\\n“That’s capital.”\\n\\n“I did not venture to disregard your excellency’s commands, though the\\nroad was extremely bad. I positively walked the whole way, but I am\\nhere at my time. Konstantin Dmitrievitch, my respects”; he turned to\\nLevin, trying to seize his hand too. But Levin, scowling, made as\\nthough he did not notice his hand, and took out the snipe. “Your honors\\nhave been diverting yourselves with the chase? What kind of bird may it\\nbe, pray?” added Ryabinin, looking contemptuously at the snipe: “a\\ngreat delicacy, I suppose.” And he shook his head disapprovingly, as\\nthough he had grave doubts whether this game were worth the candle.\\n\\n“Would you like to go into my study?” Levin said in French to Stepan\\nArkadyevitch, scowling morosely. “Go into my study; you can talk\\nthere.”\\n\\n“Quite so, where you please,” said Ryabinin with contemptuous dignity,\\nas though wishing to make it felt that others might be in difficulties\\nas to how to behave, but that he could never be in any difficulty about\\nanything.\\n\\nOn entering the study Ryabinin looked about, as his habit was, as\\nthough seeking the holy picture, but when he had found it, he did not\\ncross himself. He scanned the bookcases and bookshelves, and with the\\nsame dubious air with which he had regarded the snipe, he smiled\\ncontemptuously and shook his head disapprovingly, as though by no means\\nwilling to allow that this game were worth the candle.\\n\\n“Well, have you brought the money?” asked Oblonsky. “Sit down.”\\n\\n“Oh, don’t trouble about the money. I’ve come to see you to talk it\\nover.”\\n\\n“What is there to talk over? But do sit down.”\\n\\n“I don’t mind if I do,” said Ryabinin, sitting down and leaning his\\nelbows on the back of his chair in a position of the intensest\\ndiscomfort to himself. “You must knock it down a bit, prince. It would\\nbe too bad. The money is ready conclusively to the last farthing. As to\\npaying the money down, there’ll be no hitch there.”\\n\\nLevin, who had meanwhile been putting his gun away in the cupboard, was\\njust going out of the door, but catching the merchant’s words, he\\nstopped.\\n\\n“Why, you’ve got the forest for nothing as it is,” he said. “He came to\\nme too late, or I’d have fixed the price for him.”\\n\\nRyabinin got up, and in silence, with a smile, he looked Levin down and\\nup.\\n\\n“Very close about money is Konstantin Dmitrievitch,” he said with a\\nsmile, turning to Stepan Arkadyevitch; “there’s positively no dealing\\nwith him. I was bargaining for some wheat of him, and a pretty price I\\noffered too.”\\n\\n“Why should I give you my goods for nothing? I didn’t pick it up on the\\nground, nor steal it either.”\\n\\n“Mercy on us! nowadays there’s no chance at all of stealing. With the\\nopen courts and everything done in style, nowadays there’s no question\\nof stealing. We are just talking things over like gentlemen. His\\nexcellency’s asking too much for the forest. I can’t make both ends\\nmeet over it. I must ask for a little concession.”\\n\\n“But is the thing settled between you or not? If it’s settled, it’s\\nuseless haggling; but if it’s not,” said Levin, “I’ll buy the forest.”\\n\\nThe smile vanished at once from Ryabinin’s face. A hawklike, greedy,\\ncruel expression was left upon it. With rapid, bony fingers he\\nunbuttoned his coat, revealing a shirt, bronze waistcoat buttons, and a\\nwatch chain, and quickly pulled out a fat old pocketbook.\\n\\n“Here you are, the forest is mine,” he said, crossing himself quickly,\\nand holding out his hand. “Take the money; it’s my forest. That’s\\nRyabinin’s way of doing business; he doesn’t haggle over every\\nhalf-penny,” he added, scowling and waving the pocketbook.\\n\\n“I wouldn’t be in a hurry if I were you,” said Levin.\\n\\n“Come, really,” said Oblonsky in surprise. “I’ve given my word, you\\nknow.”\\n\\nLevin went out of the room, slamming the door. Ryabinin looked towards\\nthe door and shook his head with a smile.\\n\\n“It’s all youthfulness—positively nothing but boyishness. Why, I’m\\nbuying it, upon my honor, simply, believe me, for the glory of it, that\\nRyabinin, and no one else, should have bought the copse of Oblonsky.\\nAnd as to the profits, why, I must make what God gives. In God’s name.\\nIf you would kindly sign the title-deed....”\\n\\nWithin an hour the merchant, stroking his big overcoat neatly down, and\\nhooking up his jacket, with the agreement in his pocket, seated himself\\nin his tightly covered trap, and drove homewards.\\n\\n“Ugh, these gentlefolks!” he said to the clerk. “They—they’re a nice\\nlot!”\\n\\n“That’s so,” responded the clerk, handing him the reins and buttoning\\nthe leather apron. “But I can congratulate you on the purchase, Mihail\\nIgnatitch?”\\n\\n“Well, well 17\\n\\nStepan Arkadyevitch went upstairs with his pocket bulging with notes,\\nwhich the merchant had paid him for three months in advance. The\\nbusiness of the forest was over, the money in his pocket; their\\nshooting had been excellent, and Stepan Arkadyevitch was in the\\nhappiest frame of mind, and so he felt specially anxious to dissipate\\nthe ill-humor that had come upon Levin. He wanted to finish the day at\\nsupper as pleasantly as it had been begun.\\n\\nLevin certainly was out of humor, and in spite of all his desire to be\\naffectionate and cordial to his charming visitor, he could not control\\nhis mood. The intoxication of the news that Kitty was not married had\\ngradually begun to work upon him.\\n\\nKitty was not married, but ill, and ill from love for a man who had\\nslighted her. This slight, as it were, rebounded upon him. Vronsky had\\nslighted her, and she had slighted him, Levin. Consequently Vronsky had\\nthe right to despise Levin, and therefore he was his enemy. But all\\nthis Levin did not think out. He vaguely felt that there was something\\nin it insulting to him, and he was not angry now at what had disturbed\\nhim, but he fell foul of everything that presented itself. The stupid\\nsale of the forest, the fraud practiced upon Oblonsky and concluded in\\nhis house, exasperated him.\\n\\n“Well, finished?” he said, meeting Stepan Arkadyevitch upstairs. “Would\\nyou like supper?”\\n\\n“Well, I wouldn’t say no to it. What an appetite I get in the country!\\nWonderful! Why didn’t you offer Ryabinin something?”\\n\\n“Oh, damn him!”\\n\\n“Still, how you do treat him!” said Oblonsky. “You didn’t even shake\\nhands with him. Why not shake hands with him?”\\n\\n“Because I don’t shake hands with a waiter, and a waiter’s a hundred\\ntimes better than he is.”\\n\\n“What a reactionist you are, really! What about the amalgamation of\\nclasses?” said Oblonsky.\\n\\n“Anyone who likes amalgamating is welcome to it, but it sickens me.”\\n\\n“You’re a regular reactionist, I see.”\\n\\n“Really, I have never considered what I am. I am Konstantin Levin, and\\nnothing else.”\\n\\n“And Konstantin Levin very much out of temper,” said Stepan\\nArkadyevitch, smiling.\\n\\n“Yes, I am out of temper, and do you know why? Because—excuse me—of\\nyour stupid sale....”\\n\\nStepan Arkadyevitch frowned good-humoredly, like one who feels himself\\nteased and attacked for no fault of his own.\\n\\n“Come, enough about it!” he said. “When did anybody ever sell anything\\nwithout being told immediately after the sale, ‘It was worth much\\nmore’? But when one wants to sell, no one will give anything.... No, I\\nsee you’ve a grudge against that unlucky Ryabinin.”\\n\\n“Maybe I have. And do you know why? You’ll say again that I’m a\\nreactionist, or some other terrible word; but all the same it does\\nannoy and anger me to see on all sides the impoverishing of the\\nnobility to which I belong, and, in spite of the amalgamation of\\nclasses, I’m glad to belong. And their impoverishment is not due to\\nextravagance—that would be nothing; living in good style—that’s the\\nproper thing for noblemen; it’s only the nobles who know how to do it.\\nNow the peasants about us buy land, and I don’t mind that. The\\ngentleman does nothing, while the peasant works and supplants the idle\\nman. That’s as it ought to be. And I’m very glad for the peasant. But I\\ndo mind seeing the process of impoverishment from a sort of—I don’t\\nknow what to call it—innocence. Here a Polish speculator bought for\\nhalf its value a magnificent estate from a young lady who lives in\\nNice. And there a merchant will get three acres of land, worth ten\\nroubles, as security for the loan of one rouble. Here, for no kind of\\nreason, you’ve made that rascal a present of thirty thousand roubles.”\\n\\n“Well, what should I have done? Counted every tree?”\\n\\n“Of course, they must be counted. You didn’t count them, but Ryabinin\\ndid. Ryabinin’s children will have means of livelihood and education,\\nwhile yours maybe will not!”\\n\\n“Well, you must excuse me, but there’s something mean in this counting.\\nWe have our business and they have theirs, and they must make their\\nprofit. Anyway, the thing’s done, and there’s an end of it. And here\\ncome some poached eggs, my favorite dish. And Agafea Mihalovna will\\ngive us that marvelous herb-brandy....”\\n\\nStepan Arkadyevitch sat down at the table and began joking with Agafea\\nMihalovna, assuring her that it was long since he had tasted such a\\ndinner and such a supper.\\n\\n“Well, you do praise it, anyway,” said Agafea Mihalovna, “but\\nKonstantin Dmitrievitch, give him what you will—a crust of bread—he’ll\\neat it and walk away.”\\n\\nThough Levin tried to control himself, he was gloomy and silent. He\\nwanted to put one question to Stepan Arkadyevitch, but he could not\\nbring himself to the point, and could not find the words or the moment\\nin which to put it. Stepan Arkadyevitch had gone down to his room,\\nundressed, again washed, and attired in a nightshirt with goffered\\nfrills, he had got into bed, but Levin still lingered in his room,\\ntalking of various trifling matters, and not daring to ask what he\\nwanted to know.\\n\\n“How wonderfully they make this soap,” he said gazing at a piece of\\nsoap he was handling, which Agafea Mihalovna had put ready for the\\nvisitor but Oblonsky had not used. “Only look; why, it’s a work of\\nart.”\\n\\n“Yes, everything’s brought to such a pitch of perfection nowadays,”\\nsaid Stepan Arkadyevitch, with a moist and blissful yawn. “The theater,\\nfor instance, and the entertainments ... a—a—a!” he yawned. “The\\nelectric light everywhere ... a—a—a!”\\n\\n“Yes, the electric light,” said Levin. “Yes. Oh, and where’s Vronsky\\nnow?” he asked suddenly, laying down the soap.\\n\\n“Vronsky?” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, checking his yawn; “he’s in\\nPetersburg. He left soon after you did, and he’s not once been in\\nMoscow since. And do you know, Kostya, I’ll tell you the truth,” he\\nwent on, leaning his elbow on the table, and propping on his hand his\\nhandsome ruddy face, in which his moist, good-natured, sleepy eyes\\nshone like stars. “It’s your own fault. You took fright at the sight of\\nyour rival. But, as I told you at the time, I couldn’t say which had\\nthe better chance. Why didn’t you fight it out? I told you at the time\\nthat....” He yawned inwardly, without opening his mouth.\\n\\n“Does he know, or doesn’t he, that I did make an offer?” Levin\\nwondered, gazing at him. “Yes, there’s something humbugging, diplomatic\\nin his face,” and feeling he was blushing, he looked Stepan\\nArkadyevitch straight in the face without speaking.\\n\\n“If there was anything on her side at the time, it was nothing but a\\nsuperficial attraction,” pursued Oblonsky. “His being such a perfect\\naristocrat, don’t you know, and his future position in society, had an\\ninfluence not with her, but with her mother.”\\n\\nLevin scowled. The humiliation of his rejection stung him to the heart,\\nas though it were a fresh wound he had only just received. But he was\\nat home, and the walls of home are a support.\\n\\n“Stay, stay,” he began, interrupting Oblonsky. “You talk of his being\\nan aristocrat. But allow me to ask what it consists in, that\\naristocracy of Vronsky or of anybody else, beside which I can be looked\\ndown upon? You consider Vronsky an aristocrat, but I don’t. A man whose\\nfather crawled up from nothing at all by intrigue, and whose mother—God\\nknows whom she wasn’t mixed up with.... No, excuse me, but I consider\\nmyself aristocratic, and people like me, who can point back in the past\\nto three or four honorable generations of their family, of the highest\\ndegree of breeding (talent and intellect, of course that’s another\\nmatter), and have never curried favor with anyone, never depended on\\nanyone for anything, like my father and my grandfather. And I know many\\nsuch. You think it mean of me to count the trees in my forest, while\\nyou make Ryabinin a present of thirty thousand; but you get rents from\\nyour lands and I don’t know what, while I don’t and so I prize what’s\\ncome to me from my ancestors or been won by hard work.... We are\\naristocrats, and not those who can only exist by favor of the powerful\\nof this world, and who can be bought for twopence halfpenny.”\\n\\n“Well, but whom are you attacking? I agree with you,” said Stepan\\nArkadyevitch, sincerely and genially; though he was aware that in the\\nclass of those who could be bought for twopence halfpenny Levin was\\nreckoning him too. Levin’s warmth gave him genuine pleasure. “Whom are\\nyou attacking? Though a good deal is not true that you say about\\nVronsky, but I won’t talk about that. I tell you straight out, if I\\nwere you, I should go back with me to Moscow, and....”\\n\\n“No; I don’t know whether you know it or not, but I don’t care. And I\\ntell you—I did make an offer and was rejected, and Katerina\\nAlexandrovna is nothing now to me but a painful and humiliating\\nreminiscence.”\\n\\n“What ever for? What nonsense!”\\n\\n“But we won’t talk about it. Please forgive me, if I’ve been nasty,”\\nsaid Levin. Now that he had opened his heart, he became as he had been\\nin the morning. “You’re not angry with me, Stiva? Please don’t be\\nangry,” he said, and smiling, he took his hand.\\n\\n“Of course not; not a bit, and no reason to be. I’m glad we’ve spoken\\nopenly. And do you know, stand-shooting in the morning is unusually\\ngood—why not go? I couldn’t sleep the night anyway, but I might go\\nstraight from shooting to the station.”\\n\\n“Capital 18\\n\\nAlthough all Vronsky’s inner life was absorbed in his passion, his\\nexternal life unalterably and inevitably followed along the old\\naccustomed lines of his social and regimental ties and interests. The\\ninterests of his regiment took an important place in Vronsky’s life,\\nboth because he was fond of the regiment, and because the regiment was\\nfond of him. They were not only fond of Vronsky in his regiment, they\\nrespected him too, and were proud of him; proud that this man, with his\\nimmense wealth, his brilliant education and abilities, and the path\\nopen before him to every kind of success, distinction, and ambition,\\nhad disregarded all that, and of all the interests of life had the\\ninterests of his regiment and his comrades nearest to his heart.\\nVronsky was aware of his comrades’ view of him, and in addition to his\\nliking for the life, he felt bound to keep up that reputation.\\n\\nIt need not be said that he did not speak of his love to any of his\\ncomrades, nor did he betray his secret even in the wildest drinking\\nbouts (though indeed he was never so drunk as to lose all control of\\nhimself). And he shut up any of his thoughtless comrades who attempted\\nto allude to his connection. But in spite of that, his love was known\\nto all the town; everyone guessed with more or less confidence at his\\nrelations with Madame Karenina. The majority of the younger men envied\\nhim for just what was the most irksome factor in his love—the exalted\\nposition of Karenin, and the consequent publicity of their connection\\nin society.\\n\\nThe greater number of the young women, who envied Anna and had long\\nbeen weary of hearing her called _virtuous_, rejoiced at the\\nfulfillment of their predictions, and were only waiting for a decisive\\nturn in public opinion to fall upon her with all the weight of their\\nscorn. They were already making ready their handfuls of mud to fling at\\nher when the right moment arrived. The greater number of the\\nmiddle-aged people and certain great personages were displeased at the\\nprospect of the impending scandal in society.\\n\\nVronsky’s mother, on hearing of his connection, was at first pleased at\\nit, because nothing to her mind gave such a finishing touch to a\\nbrilliant young man as a _liaison_ in the highest society; she was\\npleased, too, that Madame Karenina, who had so taken her fancy, and had\\ntalked so much of her son, was, after all, just like all other pretty\\nand well-bred women,—at least according to the Countess Vronskaya’s\\nideas. But she had heard of late that her son had refused a position\\noffered him of great importance to his career, simply in order to\\nremain in the regiment, where he could be constantly seeing Madame\\nKarenina. She learned that great personages were displeased with him on\\nthis account, and she changed her opinion. She was vexed, too, that\\nfrom all she could learn of this connection it was not that brilliant,\\ngraceful, worldly _liaison_ which she would have welcomed, but a sort\\nof Wertherish, desperate passion, so she was told, which might well\\nlead him into imprudence. She had not seen him since his abrupt\\ndeparture from Moscow, and she sent her elder son to bid him come to\\nsee her.\\n\\nThis elder son, too, was displeased with his younger brother. He did\\nnot distinguish what sort of love his might be, big or little,\\npassionate or passionless, lasting or passing (he kept a ballet girl\\nhimself, though he was the father of a family, so he was lenient in\\nthese matters), but he knew that this love affair was viewed with\\ndispleasure by those whom it was necessary to please, and therefore he\\ndid not approve of his brother’s conduct.\\n\\nBesides the service and society, Vronsky had another great\\ninterest—horses; he was passionately fond of horses.\\n\\nThat year races and a steeplechase had been arranged for the officers.\\nVronsky had put his name down, bought a thoroughbred English mare, and\\nin spite of his love affair, he was looking forward to the races with\\nintense, though reserved, excitement....\\n\\nThese two passions did not interfere with one another. On the contrary,\\nhe needed occupation and distraction quite apart from his love, so as\\nto recruit and rest himself from the violent emotions that agitated\\nhim 19\\n\\nOn the day of the races at Krasnoe Selo, Vronsky had come earlier than\\nusual to eat beefsteak in the common messroom of the regiment. He had\\nno need to be strict with himself, as he had very quickly been brought\\ndown to the required light weight; but still he had to avoid gaining\\nflesh, and so he eschewed farinaceous and sweet dishes. He sat with his\\ncoat unbuttoned over a white waistcoat, resting both elbows on the\\ntable, and while waiting for the steak he had ordered he looked at a\\nFrench novel that lay open on his plate. He was only looking at the\\nbook to avoid conversation with the officers coming in and out; he was\\nthinking.\\n\\nHe was thinking of Anna’s promise to see him that day after the races.\\nBut he had not seen her for three days, and as her husband had just\\nreturned from abroad, he did not know whether she would be able to meet\\nhim today or not, and he did not know how to find out. He had had his\\nlast interview with her at his cousin Betsy’s summer villa. He visited\\nthe Karenins’ summer villa as rarely as possible. Now he wanted to go\\nthere, and he pondered the question how to do it.\\n\\n“Of course I shall say Betsy has sent me to ask whether she’s coming to\\nthe races. Of course, I’ll go,” he decided, lifting his head from the\\nbook. And as he vividly pictured the happiness of seeing her, his face\\nlighted up.\\n\\n“Send to my house, and tell them to have out the carriage and three\\nhorses as quick as they can,” he said to the servant, who handed him\\nthe steak on a hot silver dish, and moving the dish up he began eating.\\n\\nFrom the billiard room next door came the sound of balls knocking, of\\ntalk and laughter. Two officers appeared at the entrance-door: one, a\\nyoung fellow, with a feeble, delicate face, who had lately joined the\\nregiment from the Corps of Pages; the other, a plump, elderly officer,\\nwith a bracelet on his wrist, and little eyes, lost in fat.\\n\\nVronsky glanced at them, frowned, and looking down at his book as\\nthough he had not noticed them, he proceeded to eat and read at the\\nsame time.\\n\\n“What? Fortifying yourself for your work?” said the plump officer,\\nsitting down beside him.\\n\\n“As you see,” responded Vronsky, knitting his brows, wiping his mouth,\\nand not looking at the officer.\\n\\n“So you’re not afraid of getting fat?” said the latter, turning a chair\\nround for the young officer.\\n\\n“What?” said Vronsky angrily, making a wry face of disgust, and showing\\nhis even teeth.\\n\\n“You’re not afraid of getting fat?”\\n\\n“Waiter, sherry!” said Vronsky, without replying, and moving the book\\nto the other side of him, he went on reading.\\n\\nThe plump officer took up the list of wines and turned to the young\\nofficer.\\n\\n“You choose what we’re to drink,” he said, handing him the card, and\\nlooking at him.\\n\\n“Rhine wine, please,” said the young officer, stealing a timid glance\\nat Vronsky, and trying to pull his scarcely visible mustache. Seeing\\nthat Vronsky did not turn round, the young officer got up.\\n\\n“Let’s go into the billiard room,” he said.\\n\\nThe plump officer rose submissively, and they moved towards the door.\\n\\nAt that moment there walked into the room the tall and well-built\\nCaptain Yashvin. Nodding with an air of lofty contempt to the two\\nofficers, he went up to Vronsky.\\n\\n“Ah! here he is!” he cried, bringing his big hand down heavily on his\\nepaulet. Vronsky looked round angrily, but his face lighted up\\nimmediately with his characteristic expression of genial and manly\\nserenity.\\n\\n“That’s it, Alexey,” said the captain, in his loud baritone. “You must\\njust eat a mouthful, now, and drink only one tiny glass.”\\n\\n“Oh, I’m not hungry.”\\n\\n“There go the inseparables,” Yashvin dropped, glancing sarcastically at\\nthe two officers who were at that instant leaving the room. And he bent\\nhis long legs, swathed in tight riding breeches, and sat down in the\\nchair, too low for him, so that his knees were cramped up in a sharp\\nangle.\\n\\n“Why didn’t you turn up at the Red Theater yesterday? Numerova wasn’t\\nat all bad. Where were you?”\\n\\n“I was late at the Tverskoys’,” said Vronsky.\\n\\n“Ah!” responded Yashvin.\\n\\nYashvin, a gambler and a rake, a man not merely without moral\\nprinciples, but of immoral principles, Yashvin was Vronsky’s greatest\\nfriend in the regiment. Vronsky liked him both for his exceptional\\nphysical strength, which he showed for the most part by being able to\\ndrink like a fish, and do without sleep without being in the slightest\\ndegree affected by it; and for his great strength of character, which\\nhe showed in his relations with his comrades and superior officers,\\ncommanding both fear and respect, and also at cards, when he would play\\nfor tens of thousands and however much he might have drunk, always with\\nsuch skill and decision that he was reckoned the best player in the\\nEnglish Club. Vronsky respected and liked Yashvin particularly because\\nhe felt Yashvin liked him, not for his name and his money, but for\\nhimself. And of all men he was the only one with whom Vronsky would\\nhave liked to speak of his love. He felt that Yashvin, in spite of his\\napparent contempt for every sort of feeling, was the only man who\\ncould, so he fancied, comprehend the intense passion which now filled\\nhis whole life. Moreover, he felt certain that Yashvin, as it was, took\\nno delight in gossip and scandal, and interpreted his feeling rightly,\\nthat is to say, knew and believed that this passion was not a jest, not\\na pastime, but something more serious and important.\\n\\nVronsky had never spoken to him of his passion, but he was aware that\\nhe knew all about it, and that he put the right interpretation on it,\\nand he was glad to see that in his eyes.\\n\\n“Ah! yes,” he said, to the announcement that Vronsky had been at the\\nTverskoys’; and his black eyes shining, he plucked at his left\\nmustache, and began twisting it into his mouth, a bad habit he had.\\n\\n“Well, and what did you do yesterday? Win anything?” asked Vronsky.\\n\\n“Eight thousand. But three don’t count; he won’t pay up.”\\n\\n“Oh, then you can afford to lose over me,” said Vronsky, laughing.\\n(Yashvin had bet heavily on Vronsky in the races.)\\n\\n“No chance of my losing. Mahotin’s the only one that’s risky.”\\n\\nAnd the conversation passed to forecasts of the coming race, the only\\nthing Vronsky could think of just now.\\n\\n“Come along, I’ve finished,” said Vronsky, and getting up he went to\\nthe door. Yashvin got up too, stretching his long legs and his long\\nback.\\n\\n“It’s too early for me to dine, but I must have a drink. I’ll come\\nalong directly. Hi, wine!” he shouted, in his rich voice, that always\\nrang out so loudly at drill, and set the windows shaking now.\\n\\n“No, all right,” he shouted again immediately after. “You’re going\\nhome, so I’ll go with you.”\\n\\nAnd he walked out with Vronsky 20\\n\\nVronsky was staying in a roomy, clean, Finnish hut, divided into two by\\na partition. Petritsky lived with him in camp too. Petritsky was asleep\\nwhen Vronsky and Yashvin came into the hut.\\n\\n“Get up, don’t go on sleeping,” said Yashvin, going behind the\\npartition and giving Petritsky, who was lying with ruffled hair and\\nwith his nose in the pillow, a prod on the shoulder.\\n\\nPetritsky jumped up suddenly onto his knees and looked round.\\n\\n“Your brother’s been here,” he said to Vronsky. “He waked me up, damn\\nhim, and said he’d look in again.” And pulling up the rug he flung\\nhimself back on the pillow. “Oh, do shut up, Yashvin!” he said, getting\\nfurious with Yashvin, who was pulling the rug off him. “Shut up!” He\\nturned over and opened his eyes. “You’d better tell me what to drink;\\nsuch a nasty taste in my mouth, that....”\\n\\n“Brandy’s better than anything,” boomed Yashvin. “Tereshtchenko! brandy\\nfor your master and cucumbers,” he shouted, obviously taking pleasure\\nin the sound of his own voice.\\n\\n“Brandy, do you think? Eh?” queried Petritsky, blinking and rubbing his\\neyes. “And you’ll drink something? All right then, we’ll have a drink\\ntogether! Vronsky, have a drink?” said Petritsky, getting up and\\nwrapping the tiger-skin rug round him. He went to the door of the\\npartition wall, raised his hands, and hummed in French, “There was a\\nking in Thule.” “Vronsky, will you have a drink?”\\n\\n“Go along,” said Vronsky, putting on the coat his valet handed to him.\\n\\n“Where are you off to?” asked Yashvin. “Oh, here are your three\\nhorses,” he added, seeing the carriage drive up.\\n\\n“To the stables, and I’ve got to see Bryansky, too, about the horses,”\\nsaid Vronsky.\\n\\nVronsky had as a fact promised to call at Bryansky’s, some eight miles\\nfrom Peterhof, and to bring him some money owing for some horses; and\\nhe hoped to have time to get that in too. But his comrades were at once\\naware that he was not only going there.\\n\\nPetritsky, still humming, winked and made a pout with his lips, as\\nthough he would say: “Oh, yes, we know your Bryansky.”\\n\\n“Mind you’re not late!” was Yashvin’s only comment; and to change the\\nconversation: “How’s my roan? is he doing all right?” he inquired,\\nlooking out of the window at the middle one of the three horses, which\\nhe had sold Vronsky.\\n\\n“Stop!” cried Petritsky to Vronsky as he was just going out. “Your\\nbrother left a letter and a note for you. Wait a bit; where are they?”\\n\\nVronsky stopped.\\n\\n“Well, where are they?”\\n\\n“Where are they? That’s just the question!” said Petritsky solemnly,\\nmoving his forefinger upwards from his nose.\\n\\n“Come, tell me; this is silly!” said Vronsky smiling.\\n\\n“I have not lighted the fire. Here somewhere about.”\\n\\n“Come, enough fooling! Where is the letter?”\\n\\n“No, I’ve forgotten really. Or was it a dream? Wait a bit, wait a bit!\\nBut what’s the use of getting in a rage. If you’d drunk four bottles\\nyesterday as I did you’d forget where you were lying. Wait a bit, I’ll\\nremember!”\\n\\nPetritsky went behind the partition and lay down on his bed.\\n\\n“Wait a bit! This was how I was lying, and this was how he was\\nstanding. Yes—yes—yes.... Here it is!”—and Petritsky pulled a letter\\nout from under the mattress, where he had hidden it.\\n\\nVronsky took the letter and his brother’s note. It was the letter he\\nwas expecting—from his mother, reproaching him for not having been to\\nsee her—and the note was from his brother to say that he must have a\\nlittle talk with him. Vronsky knew that it was all about the same\\nthing. “What business is it of theirs!” thought Vronsky, and crumpling\\nup the letters he thrust them between the buttons of his coat so as to\\nread them carefully on the road. In the porch of the hut he was met by\\ntwo officers; one of his regiment and one of another.\\n\\nVronsky’s quarters were always a meeting place for all the officers.\\n\\n“Where are you off to?”\\n\\n“I must go to Peterhof.”\\n\\n“Has the mare come from Tsarskoe?”\\n\\n“Yes, but I’ve not seen her yet.”\\n\\n“They say Mahotin’s Gladiator’s lame.”\\n\\n“Nonsense! But however are you going to race in this mud?” said the\\nother.\\n\\n“Here are my saviors!” cried Petritsky, seeing them come in. Before him\\nstood the orderly with a tray of brandy and salted cucumbers. “Here’s\\nYashvin ordering me to drink a pick-me-up.”\\n\\n“Well, you did give it to us yesterday,” said one of those who had come\\nin; “you didn’t let us get a wink of sleep all night.”\\n\\n“Oh, didn’t we make a pretty finish!” said Petritsky. “Volkov climbed\\nonto the roof and began telling us how sad he was. I said: ‘Let’s have\\nmusic, the funeral march!’ He fairly dropped asleep on the roof over\\nthe funeral march.”\\n\\n“Drink it up; you positively must drink the brandy, and then seltzer\\nwater and a lot of lemon,” said Yashvin, standing over Petritsky like a\\nmother making a child take medicine, “and then a little champagne—just\\na small bottle.”\\n\\n“Come, there’s some sense in that. Stop a bit, Vronsky. We’ll all have\\na drink.”\\n\\n“No; good-bye all of you. I’m not going to drink today.”\\n\\n“Why, are you gaining weight? All right, then we must have it alone.\\nGive us the seltzer water and lemon.”\\n\\n“Vronsky!” shouted someone when he was already outside.\\n\\n“Well?”\\n\\n“You’d better get your hair cut, it’ll weigh you down, especially at\\nthe top.”\\n\\nVronsky was in fact beginning, prematurely, to get a little bald. He\\nlaughed gaily, showing his even teeth, and pulling his cap over the\\nthin place, went out and got into his carriage.\\n\\n“To the stables!” he said, and was just pulling out the letters to read\\nthem through, but he thought better of it, and put off reading them so\\nas not to distract his attention before looking at the mare. “Later 21\\n\\nThe temporary stable, a wooden shed, had been put up close to the race\\ncourse, and there his mare was to have been taken the previous day. He\\nhad not yet seen her there.\\n\\nDuring the last few days he had not ridden her out for exercise\\nhimself, but had put her in the charge of the trainer, and so now he\\npositively did not know in what condition his mare had arrived\\nyesterday and was today. He had scarcely got out of his carriage when\\nhis groom, the so-called “stable boy,” recognizing the carriage some\\nway off, called the trainer. A dry-looking Englishman, in high boots\\nand a short jacket, clean-shaven, except for a tuft below his chin,\\ncame to meet him, walking with the uncouth gait of jockey, turning his\\nelbows out and swaying from side to side.\\n\\n“Well, how’s Frou-Frou?” Vronsky asked in English.\\n\\n“All right, sir,” the Englishman’s voice responded somewhere in the\\ninside of his throat. “Better not go in,” he added, touching his hat.\\n“I’ve put a muzzle on her, and the mare’s fidgety. Better not go in,\\nit’ll excite the mare.”\\n\\n“No, I’m going in. I want to look at her.”\\n\\n“Come along, then,” said the Englishman, frowning, and speaking with\\nhis mouth shut, and, with swinging elbows, he went on in front with his\\ndisjointed gait.\\n\\nThey went into the little yard in front of the shed. A stable boy,\\nspruce and smart in his holiday attire, met them with a broom in his\\nhand, and followed them. In the shed there were five horses in their\\nseparate stalls, and Vronsky knew that his chief rival, Gladiator, a\\nvery tall chestnut horse, had been brought there, and must be standing\\namong them. Even more than his mare, Vronsky longed to see Gladiator,\\nwhom he had never seen. But he knew that by the etiquette of the race\\ncourse it was not merely impossible for him to see the horse, but\\nimproper even to ask questions about him. Just as he was passing along\\nthe passage, the boy opened the door into the second horse-box on the\\nleft, and Vronsky caught a glimpse of a big chestnut horse with white\\nlegs. He knew that this was Gladiator, but, with the feeling of a man\\nturning away from the sight of another man’s open letter, he turned\\nround and went into Frou-Frou’s stall.\\n\\n“The horse is here belonging to Mak... Mak... I never can say the\\nname,” said the Englishman, over his shoulder, pointing his big finger\\nand dirty nail towards Gladiator’s stall.\\n\\n“Mahotin? Yes, he’s my most serious rival,” said Vronsky.\\n\\n“If you were riding him,” said the Englishman, “I’d bet on you.”\\n\\n“Frou-Frou’s more nervous; he’s stronger,” said Vronsky, smiling at the\\ncompliment to his riding.\\n\\n“In a steeplechase it all depends on riding and on pluck,” said the\\nEnglishman.\\n\\nOf pluck—that is, energy and courage—Vronsky did not merely feel that\\nhe had enough; what was of far more importance, he was firmly convinced\\nthat no one in the world could have more of this “pluck” than he had.\\n\\n“Don’t you think I want more thinning down?”\\n\\n“Oh, no,” answered the Englishman. “Please, don’t speak loud. The\\nmare’s fidgety,” he added, nodding towards the horse-box, before which\\nthey were standing, and from which came the sound of restless stamping\\nin the straw.\\n\\nHe opened the door, and Vronsky went into the horse-box, dimly lighted\\nby one little window. In the horse-box stood a dark bay mare, with a\\nmuzzle on, picking at the fresh straw with her hoofs. Looking round him\\nin the twilight of the horse-box, Vronsky unconsciously took in once\\nmore in a comprehensive glance all the points of his favorite mare.\\nFrou-Frou was a beast of medium size, not altogether free from\\nreproach, from a breeder’s point of view. She was small-boned all over;\\nthough her chest was extremely prominent in front, it was narrow. Her\\nhind-quarters were a little drooping, and in her fore-legs, and still\\nmore in her hind-legs, there was a noticeable curvature. The muscles of\\nboth hind- and fore-legs were not very thick; but across her shoulders\\nthe mare was exceptionally broad, a peculiarity specially striking now\\nthat she was lean from training. The bones of her legs below the knees\\nlooked no thicker than a finger from in front, but were extraordinarily\\nthick seen from the side. She looked altogether, except across the\\nshoulders, as it were, pinched in at the sides and pressed out in\\ndepth. But she had in the highest degree the quality that makes all\\ndefects forgotten: that quality was _blood_, the blood _that tells_, as\\nthe English expression has it. The muscles stood up sharply under the\\nnetwork of sinews, covered with the delicate, mobile skin, soft as\\nsatin, and they were hard as bone. Her clean-cut head, with prominent,\\nbright, spirited eyes, broadened out at the open nostrils, that showed\\nthe red blood in the cartilage within. About all her figure, and\\nespecially her head, there was a certain expression of energy, and, at\\nthe same time, of softness. She was one of those creatures which seem\\nonly not to speak because the mechanism of their mouth does not allow\\nthem to.\\n\\nTo Vronsky, at any rate, it seemed that she understood all he felt at\\nthat moment, looking at her.\\n\\nDirectly Vronsky went towards her, she drew in a deep breath, and,\\nturning back her prominent eye till the white looked bloodshot, she\\nstarted at the approaching figures from the opposite side, shaking her\\nmuzzle, and shifting lightly from one leg to the other.\\n\\n“There, you see how fidgety she is,” said the Englishman.\\n\\n“There, darling! There!” said Vronsky, going up to the mare and\\nspeaking soothingly to her.\\n\\nBut the nearer he came, the more excited she grew. Only when he stood\\nby her head, she was suddenly quieter, while the muscles quivered under\\nher soft, delicate coat. Vronsky patted her strong neck, straightened\\nover her sharp withers a stray lock of her mane that had fallen on the\\nother side, and moved his face near her dilated nostrils, transparent\\nas a bat’s wing. She drew a loud breath and snorted out through her\\ntense nostrils, started, pricked up her sharp ear, and put out her\\nstrong, black lip towards Vronsky, as though she would nip hold of his\\nsleeve. But remembering the muzzle, she shook it and again began\\nrestlessly stamping one after the other her shapely legs.\\n\\n“Quiet, darling, quiet!” he said, patting her again over her\\nhind-quarters; and with a glad sense that his mare was in the best\\npossible condition, he went out of the horse-box.\\n\\nThe mare’s excitement had infected Vronsky. He felt that his heart was\\nthrobbing, and that he, too, like the mare, longed to move, to bite; it\\nwas both dreadful and delicious.\\n\\n“Well, I rely on you, then,” he said to the Englishman; “half-past six\\non the ground.”\\n\\n“All right,” said the Englishman. “Oh, where are you going, my lord?”\\nhe asked suddenly, using the title “my lord,” which he had scarcely\\never used before.\\n\\nVronsky in amazement raised his head, and stared, as he knew how to\\nstare, not into the Englishman’s eyes, but at his forehead, astounded\\nat the impertinence of his question. But realizing that in asking this\\nthe Englishman had been looking at him not as an employer, but as a\\njockey, he answered:\\n\\n“I’ve got to go to Bryansky’s; I shall be home within an hour.”\\n\\n“How often I’m asked that question today!” he said to himself, and he\\nblushed, a thing which rarely happened to him. The Englishman looked\\ngravely at him; and, as though he, too, knew where Vronsky was going,\\nhe added:\\n\\n“The great thing’s to keep quiet before a race,” said he; “don’t get\\nout of temper or upset about anything.”\\n\\n“All right,” answered Vronsky, smiling; and jumping into his carriage,\\nhe told the man to drive to Peterhof.\\n\\nBefore he had driven many paces away, the dark clouds that had been\\nthreatening rain all day broke, and there was a heavy downpour of rain.\\n\\n“What a pity!” thought Vronsky, putting up the roof of the carriage.\\n“It was muddy before, now it will be a perfect swamp.” As he sat in\\nsolitude in the closed carriage, he took out his mother’s letter and\\nhis brother’s note, and read them through.\\n\\nYes, it was the same thing over and over again. Everyone, his mother,\\nhis brother, everyone thought fit to interfere in the affairs of his\\nheart. This interference aroused in him a feeling of angry hatred—a\\nfeeling he had rarely known before. “What business is it of theirs? Why\\ndoes everybody feel called upon to concern himself about me? And why do\\nthey worry me so? Just because they see that this is something they\\ncan’t understand. If it were a common, vulgar, worldly intrigue, they\\nwould have left me alone. They feel that this is something different,\\nthat this is not a mere pastime, that this woman is dearer to me than\\nlife. And this is incomprehensible, and that’s why it annoys them.\\nWhatever our destiny is or may be, we have made it ourselves, and we do\\nnot complain of it,” he said, in the word _we_ linking himself with\\nAnna. “No, they must needs teach us how to live. They haven’t an idea\\nof what happiness is; they don’t know that without our love, for us\\nthere is neither happiness nor unhappiness—no life at all,” he thought.\\n\\nHe was angry with all of them for their interference just because he\\nfelt in his soul that they, all these people, were right. He felt that\\nthe love that bound him to Anna was not a momentary impulse, which\\nwould pass, as worldly intrigues do pass, leaving no other traces in\\nthe life of either but pleasant or unpleasant memories. He felt all the\\ntorture of his own and her position, all the difficulty there was for\\nthem, conspicuous as they were in the eye of all the world, in\\nconcealing their love, in lying and deceiving; and in lying, deceiving,\\nfeigning, and continually thinking of others, when the passion that\\nunited them was so intense that they were both oblivious of everything\\nelse but their love.\\n\\nHe vividly recalled all the constantly recurring instances of\\ninevitable necessity for lying and deceit, which were so against his\\nnatural bent. He recalled particularly vividly the shame he had more\\nthan once detected in her at this necessity for lying and deceit. And\\nhe experienced the strange feeling that had sometimes come upon him\\nsince his secret love for Anna. This was a feeling of loathing for\\nsomething—whether for Alexey Alexandrovitch, or for himself, or for the\\nwhole world, he could not have said. But he always drove away this\\nstrange feeling. Now, too, he shook it off and continued the thread of\\nhis thoughts.\\n\\n“Yes, she was unhappy before, but proud and at peace; and now she\\ncannot be at peace and feel secure in her dignity, though she does not\\nshow it. Yes, we must put an end to it,” he decided.\\n\\nAnd for the first time the idea clearly presented itself that it was\\nessential to put an end to this false position, and the sooner the\\nbetter. “Throw up everything, she and I, and hide ourselves somewhere\\nalone with our love,” he said to himself 22\\n\\nThe rain did not last long, and by the time Vronsky arrived, his\\nshaft-horse trotting at full speed and dragging the trace-horses\\ngalloping through the mud, with their reins hanging loose, the sun had\\npeeped out again, the roofs of the summer villas and the old limetrees\\nin the gardens on both sides of the principal streets sparkled with wet\\nbrilliance, and from the twigs came a pleasant drip and from the roofs\\nrushing streams of water. He thought no more of the shower spoiling the\\nrace course, but was rejoicing now that—thanks to the rain—he would be\\nsure to find her at home and alone, as he knew that Alexey\\nAlexandrovitch, who had lately returned from a foreign watering place,\\nhad not moved from Petersburg.\\n\\nHoping to find her alone, Vronsky alighted, as he always did, to avoid\\nattracting attention, before crossing the bridge, and walked to the\\nhouse. He did not go up the steps to the street door, but went into the\\ncourt.\\n\\n“Has your master come?” he asked a gardener.\\n\\n“No, sir. The mistress is at home. But will you please go to the front\\ndoor; there are servants there,” the gardener answered. “They’ll open\\nthe door.”\\n\\n“No, I’ll go in from the garden.”\\n\\nAnd feeling satisfied that she was alone, and wanting to take her by\\nsurprise, since he had not promised to be there today, and she would\\ncertainly not expect him to come before the races, he walked, holding\\nhis sword and stepping cautiously over the sandy path, bordered with\\nflowers, to the terrace that looked out upon the garden. Vronsky forgot\\nnow all that he had thought on the way of the hardships and\\ndifficulties of their position. He thought of nothing but that he would\\nsee her directly, not in imagination, but living, all of her, as she\\nwas in reality. He was just going in, stepping on his whole foot so as\\nnot to creak, up the worn steps of the terrace, when he suddenly\\nremembered what he always forgot, and what caused the most torturing\\nside of his relations with her, her son with his questioning—hostile,\\nas he fancied—eyes.\\n\\nThis boy was more often than anyone else a check upon their freedom.\\nWhen he was present, both Vronsky and Anna did not merely avoid\\nspeaking of anything that they could not have repeated before everyone;\\nthey did not even allow themselves to refer by hints to anything the\\nboy did not understand. They had made no agreement about this, it had\\nsettled itself. They would have felt it wounding themselves to deceive\\nthe child. In his presence they talked like acquaintances. But in spite\\nof this caution, Vronsky often saw the child’s intent, bewildered\\nglance fixed upon him, and a strange shyness, uncertainty, at one time\\nfriendliness, at another, coldness and reserve, in the boy’s manner to\\nhim; as though the child felt that between this man and his mother\\nthere existed some important bond, the significance of which he could\\nnot understand.\\n\\nAs a fact, the boy did feel that he could not understand this relation,\\nand he tried painfully, and was not able to make clear to himself what\\nfeeling he ought to have for this man. With a child’s keen instinct for\\nevery manifestation of feeling, he saw distinctly that his father, his\\ngoverness, his nurse,—all did not merely dislike Vronsky, but looked on\\nhim with horror and aversion, though they never said anything about\\nhim, while his mother looked on him as her greatest friend.\\n\\n“What does it mean? Who is he? How ought I to love him? If I don’t\\nknow, it’s my fault; either I’m stupid or a naughty boy,” thought the\\nchild. And this was what caused his dubious, inquiring, sometimes\\nhostile, expression, and the shyness and uncertainty which Vronsky\\nfound so irksome. This child’s presence always and infallibly called up\\nin Vronsky that strange feeling of inexplicable loathing which he had\\nexperienced of late. This child’s presence called up both in Vronsky\\nand in Anna a feeling akin to the feeling of a sailor who sees by the\\ncompass that the direction in which he is swiftly moving is far from\\nthe right one, but that to arrest his motion is not in his power, that\\nevery instant is carrying him further and further away, and that to\\nadmit to himself his deviation from the right direction is the same as\\nadmitting his certain ruin.\\n\\nThis child, with his innocent outlook upon life, was the compass that\\nshowed them the point to which they had departed from what they knew,\\nbut did not want to know.\\n\\nThis time Seryozha was not at home, and she was completely alone. She\\nwas sitting on the terrace waiting for the return of her son, who had\\ngone out for his walk and been caught in the rain. She had sent a\\nmanservant and a maid out to look for him. Dressed in a white gown,\\ndeeply embroidered, she was sitting in a corner of the terrace behind\\nsome flowers, and did not hear him. Bending her curly black head, she\\npressed her forehead against a cool watering pot that stood on the\\nparapet, and both her lovely hands, with the rings he knew so well,\\nclasped the pot. The beauty of her whole figure, her head, her neck,\\nher hands, struck Vronsky every time as something new and unexpected.\\nHe stood still, gazing at her in ecstasy. But, directly he would have\\nmade a step to come nearer to her, she was aware of his presence,\\npushed away the watering pot, and turned her flushed face towards him.\\n\\n“What’s the matter? You are ill?” he said to her in French, going up to\\nher. He would have run to her, but remembering that there might be\\nspectators, he looked round towards the balcony door, and reddened a\\nlittle, as he always reddened, feeling that he had to be afraid and be\\non his guard.\\n\\n“No, I’m quite well,” she said, getting up and pressing his\\noutstretched hand tightly. “I did not expect ... thee.”\\n\\n“Mercy! what cold hands!” he said.\\n\\n“You startled me,” she said. “I’m alone, and expecting Seryozha; he’s\\nout for a walk; they’ll come in from this side.”\\n\\nBut, in spite of her efforts to be calm, her lips were quivering.\\n\\n“Forgive me for coming, but I couldn’t pass the day without seeing\\nyou,” he went on, speaking French, as he always did to avoid using the\\nstiff Russian plural form, so impossibly frigid between them, and the\\ndangerously intimate singular.\\n\\n“Forgive you? I’m so glad!”\\n\\n“But you’re ill or worried,” he went on, not letting go her hands and\\nbending over her. “What were you thinking of?”\\n\\n“Always the same thing,” she said, with a smile.\\n\\nShe spoke the truth. If ever at any moment she had been asked what she\\nwas thinking of, she could have answered truly: of the same thing, of\\nher happiness and her unhappiness. She was thinking, just when he came\\nupon her, of this: why was it, she wondered, that to others, to Betsy\\n(she knew of her secret connection with Tushkevitch) it was all easy,\\nwhile to her it was such torture? Today this thought gained special\\npoignancy from certain other considerations. She asked him about the\\nraces. He answered her questions, and, seeing that she was agitated,\\ntrying to calm her, he began telling her in the simplest tone the\\ndetails of his preparations for the races.\\n\\n“Tell him or not tell him?” she thought, looking into his quiet,\\naffectionate eyes. “He is so happy, so absorbed in his races that he\\nwon’t understand as he ought, he won’t understand all the gravity of\\nthis fact to us.”\\n\\n“But you haven’t told me what you were thinking of when I came in,” he\\nsaid, interrupting his narrative; “please tell me!”\\n\\nShe did not answer, and, bending her head a little, she looked\\ninquiringly at him from under her brows, her eyes shining under their\\nlong lashes. Her hand shook as it played with a leaf she had picked. He\\nsaw it, and his face expressed that utter subjection, that slavish\\ndevotion, which had done so much to win her.\\n\\n“I see something has happened. Do you suppose I can be at peace,\\nknowing you have a trouble I am not sharing? Tell me, for God’s sake,”\\nhe repeated imploringly.\\n\\n“Yes, I shan’t be able to forgive him if he does not realize all the\\ngravity of it. Better not tell; why put him to the proof?” she thought,\\nstill staring at him in the same way, and feeling the hand that held\\nthe leaf was trembling more and more.\\n\\n“For God’s sake!” he repeated, taking her hand.\\n\\n“Shall I tell you?”\\n\\n“Yes, yes, yes....”\\n\\n“I’m with child,” she said, softly and deliberately. The leaf in her\\nhand shook more violently, but she did not take her eyes off him,\\nwatching how he would take it. He turned white, would have said\\nsomething, but stopped; he dropped her hand, and his head sank on his\\nbreast. “Yes, he realizes all the gravity of it,” she thought, and\\ngratefully she pressed his hand.\\n\\nBut she was mistaken in thinking he realized the gravity of the fact as\\nshe, a woman, realized it. On hearing it, he felt come upon him with\\ntenfold intensity that strange feeling of loathing of someone. But at\\nthe same time, he felt that the turning-point he had been longing for\\nhad come now; that it was impossible to go on concealing things from\\nher husband, and it was inevitable in one way or another that they\\nshould soon put an end to their unnatural position. But, besides that,\\nher emotion physically affected him in the same way. He looked at her\\nwith a look of submissive tenderness, kissed her hand, got up, and, in\\nsilence, paced up and down the terrace.\\n\\n“Yes,” he said, going up to her resolutely. “Neither you nor I have\\nlooked on our relations as a passing amusement, and now our fate is\\nsealed. It is absolutely necessary to put an end”—he looked round as he\\nspoke—“to the deception in which we are living.”\\n\\n“Put an end? How put an end, Alexey?” she said softly.\\n\\nShe was calmer now, and her face lighted up with a tender smile.\\n\\n“Leave your husband and make our life one.”\\n\\n“It is one as it is,” she answered, scarcely audibly.\\n\\n“Yes, but altogether; altogether.”\\n\\n“But how, Alexey, tell me how?” she said in melancholy mockery at the\\nhopelessness of her own position. “Is there any way out of such a\\nposition? Am I not the wife of my husband?”\\n\\n“There is a way out of every position. We must take our line,” he said.\\n“Anything’s better than the position in which you’re living. Of course,\\nI see how you torture yourself over everything—the world and your son\\nand your husband.”\\n\\n“Oh, not over my husband,” she said, with a quiet smile. “I don’t know\\nhim, I don’t think of him. He doesn’t exist.”\\n\\n“You’re not speaking sincerely. I know you. You worry about him too.”\\n\\n“Oh, he doesn’t even know,” she said, and suddenly a hot flush came\\nover her face; her cheeks, her brow, her neck crimsoned, and tears of\\nshame came into her eyes. “But we won’t talk of him 23\\n\\nVronsky had several times already, though not so resolutely as now,\\ntried to bring her to consider their position, and every time he had\\nbeen confronted by the same superficiality and triviality with which\\nshe met his appeal now. It was as though there were something in this\\nwhich she could not or would not face, as though directly she began to\\nspeak of this, she, the real Anna, retreated somehow into herself, and\\nanother strange and unaccountable woman came out, whom he did not love,\\nand whom he feared, and who was in opposition to him. But today he was\\nresolved to have it out.\\n\\n“Whether he knows or not,” said Vronsky, in his usual quiet and\\nresolute tone, “that’s nothing to do with us. We cannot ... you cannot\\nstay like this, especially now.”\\n\\n“What’s to be done, according to you?” she asked with the same\\nfrivolous irony. She who had so feared he would take her condition too\\nlightly was now vexed with him for deducing from it the necessity of\\ntaking some step.\\n\\n“Tell him everything, and leave him.”\\n\\n“Very well, let us suppose I do that,” she said. “Do you know what the\\nresult of that would be? I can tell you it all beforehand,” and a\\nwicked light gleamed in her eyes, that had been so soft a minute\\nbefore. “‘Eh, you love another man, and have entered into criminal\\nintrigues with him?’” (Mimicking her husband, she threw an emphasis on\\nthe word “criminal,” as Alexey Alexandrovitch did.) “‘I warned you of\\nthe results in the religious, the civil, and the domestic relation. You\\nhave not listened to me. Now I cannot let you disgrace my name,—’” “and\\nmy son,” she had meant to say, but about her son she could not\\njest,—“‘disgrace my name, and’—and more in the same style,” she added.\\n“In general terms, he’ll say in his official manner, and with all\\ndistinctness and precision, that he cannot let me go, but will take all\\nmeasures in his power to prevent scandal. And he will calmly and\\npunctually act in accordance with his words. That’s what will happen.\\nHe’s not a man, but a machine, and a spiteful machine when he’s angry,”\\nshe added, recalling Alexey Alexandrovitch as she spoke, with all the\\npeculiarities of his figure and manner of speaking, and reckoning\\nagainst him every defect she could find in him, softening nothing for\\nthe great wrong she herself was doing him.\\n\\n“But, Anna,” said Vronsky, in a soft and persuasive voice, trying to\\nsoothe her, “we absolutely must, anyway, tell him, and then be guided\\nby the line he takes.”\\n\\n“What, run away?”\\n\\n“And why not run away? I don’t see how we can keep on like this. And\\nnot for my sake—I see that you suffer.”\\n\\n“Yes, run away, and become your mistress,” she said angrily.\\n\\n“Anna,” he said, with reproachful tenderness.\\n\\n“Yes,” she went on, “become your mistress, and complete the ruin\\nof....”\\n\\nAgain she would have said “my son,” but she could not utter that word.\\n\\nVronsky could not understand how she, with her strong and truthful\\nnature, could endure this state of deceit, and not long to get out of\\nit. But he did not suspect that the chief cause of it was the\\nword—_son_, which she could not bring herself to pronounce. When she\\nthought of her son, and his future attitude to his mother, who had\\nabandoned his father, she felt such terror at what she had done, that\\nshe could not face it; but, like a woman, could only try to comfort\\nherself with lying assurances that everything would remain as it always\\nhad been, and that it was possible to forget the fearful question of\\nhow it would be with her son.\\n\\n“I beg you, I entreat you,” she said suddenly, taking his hand, and\\nspeaking in quite a different tone, sincere and tender, “never speak to\\nme of that!”\\n\\n“But, Anna....”\\n\\n“Never. Leave it to me. I know all the baseness, all the horror of my\\nposition; but it’s not so easy to arrange as you think. And leave it to\\nme, and do what I say. Never speak to me of it. Do you promise me?...\\nNo, no, promise!...”\\n\\n“I promise everything, but I can’t be at peace, especially after what\\nyou have told me. I can’t be at peace, when you can’t be at peace....”\\n\\n“I?” she repeated. “Yes, I am worried sometimes; but that will pass, if\\nyou will never talk about this. When you talk about it—it’s only then\\nit worries me.”\\n\\n“I don’t understand,” he said.\\n\\n“I know,” she interrupted him, “how hard it is for your truthful nature\\nto lie, and I grieve for you. I often think that you have ruined your\\nwhole life for me.”\\n\\n“I was just thinking the very same thing,” he said; “how could you\\nsacrifice everything for my sake? I can’t forgive myself that you’re\\nunhappy!”\\n\\n“I unhappy?” she said, coming closer to him, and looking at him with an\\necstatic smile of love. “I am like a hungry man who has been given\\nfood. He may be cold, and dressed in rags, and ashamed, but he is not\\nunhappy. I unhappy? No, this is my unhappiness....”\\n\\nShe could hear the sound of her son’s voice coming towards them, and\\nglancing swiftly round the terrace, she got up impulsively. Her eyes\\nglowed with the fire he knew so well; with a rapid movement she raised\\nher lovely hands, covered with rings, took his head, looked a long look\\ninto his face, and, putting up her face with smiling, parted lips,\\nswiftly kissed his mouth and both eyes, and pushed him away. She would\\nhave gone, but he held her back.\\n\\n“When?” he murmured in a whisper, gazing in ecstasy at her.\\n\\n“Tonight, at one o’clock,” she whispered, and, with a heavy sigh, she\\nwalked with her light, swift step to meet her son.\\n\\nSeryozha had been caught by the rain in the big garden, and he and his\\nnurse had taken shelter in an arbor.\\n\\n“Well, _au revoir_,” she said to Vronsky. “I must soon be getting ready\\nfor the races. Betsy promised to fetch me.”\\n\\nVronsky, looking at his watch, went away hurriedly 24\\n\\nWhen Vronsky looked at his watch on the Karenins’ balcony, he was so\\ngreatly agitated and lost in his thoughts that he saw the figures on\\nthe watch’s face, but could not take in what time it was. He came out\\non to the highroad and walked, picking his way carefully through the\\nmud, to his carriage. He was so completely absorbed in his feeling for\\nAnna, that he did not even think what o’clock it was, and whether he\\nhad time to go to Bryansky’s. He had left him, as often happens, only\\nthe external faculty of memory, that points out each step one has to\\ntake, one after the other. He went up to his coachman, who was dozing\\non the box in the shadow, already lengthening, of a thick limetree; he\\nadmired the shifting clouds of midges circling over the hot horses,\\nand, waking the coachman, he jumped into the carriage, and told him to\\ndrive to Bryansky’s. It was only after driving nearly five miles that\\nhe had sufficiently recovered himself to look at his watch, and realize\\nthat it was half-past five, and he was late.\\n\\nThere were several races fixed for that day: the Mounted Guards’ race,\\nthen the officers’ mile-and-a-half race, then the three-mile race, and\\nthen the race for which he was entered. He could still be in time for\\nhis race, but if he went to Bryansky’s he could only just be in time,\\nand he would arrive when the whole of the court would be in their\\nplaces. That would be a pity. But he had promised Bryansky to come, and\\nso he decided to drive on, telling the coachman not to spare the\\nhorses.\\n\\nHe reached Bryansky’s, spent five minutes there, and galloped back.\\nThis rapid drive calmed him. All that was painful in his relations with\\nAnna, all the feeling of indefiniteness left by their conversation, had\\nslipped out of his mind. He was thinking now with pleasure and\\nexcitement of the race, of his being anyhow, in time, and now and then\\nthe thought of the blissful interview awaiting him that night flashed\\nacross his imagination like a flaming light.\\n\\nThe excitement of the approaching race gained upon him as he drove\\nfurther and further into the atmosphere of the races, overtaking\\ncarriages driving up from the summer villas or out of Petersburg.\\n\\nAt his quarters no one was left at home; all were at the races, and his\\nvalet was looking out for him at the gate. While he was changing his\\nclothes, his valet told him that the second race had begun already,\\nthat a lot of gentlemen had been to ask for him, and a boy had twice\\nrun up from the stables. Dressing without hurry (he never hurried\\nhimself, and never lost his self-possession), Vronsky drove to the\\nsheds. From the sheds he could see a perfect sea of carriages, and\\npeople on foot, soldiers surrounding the race course, and pavilions\\nswarming with people. The second race was apparently going on, for just\\nas he went into the sheds he heard a bell ringing. Going towards the\\nstable, he met the white-legged chestnut, Mahotin’s Gladiator, being\\nled to the race-course in a blue forage horsecloth, with what looked\\nlike huge ears edged with blue.\\n\\n“Where’s Cord?” he asked the stable-boy.\\n\\n“In the stable, putting on the saddle.”\\n\\nIn the open horse-box stood Frou-Frou, saddled ready. They were just\\ngoing to lead her out.\\n\\n“I’m not too late?”\\n\\n“All right! All right!” said the Englishman; “don’t upset yourself!”\\n\\nVronsky once more took in in one glance the exquisite lines of his\\nfavorite mare; who was quivering all over, and with an effort he tore\\nhimself from the sight of her, and went out of the stable. He went\\ntowards the pavilions at the most favorable moment for escaping\\nattention. The mile-and-a-half race was just finishing, and all eyes\\nwere fixed on the horse-guard in front and the light hussar behind,\\nurging their horses on with a last effort close to the winning post.\\nFrom the center and outside of the ring all were crowding to the\\nwinning post, and a group of soldiers and officers of the horse-guards\\nwere shouting loudly their delight at the expected triumph of their\\nofficer and comrade. Vronsky moved into the middle of the crowd\\nunnoticed, almost at the very moment when the bell rang at the finish\\nof the race, and the tall, mudspattered horse-guard who came in first,\\nbending over the saddle, let go the reins of his panting gray horse\\nthat looked dark with sweat.\\n\\nThe horse, stiffening out its legs, with an effort stopped its rapid\\ncourse, and the officer of the horse-guards looked round him like a man\\nwaking up from a heavy sleep, and just managed to smile. A crowd of\\nfriends and outsiders pressed round him.\\n\\nVronsky intentionally avoided that select crowd of the upper world,\\nwhich was moving and talking with discreet freedom before the\\npavilions. He knew that Madame Karenina was there, and Betsy, and his\\nbrother’s wife, and he purposely did not go near them for fear of\\nsomething distracting his attention. But he was continually met and\\nstopped by acquaintances, who told him about the previous races, and\\nkept asking him why he was so late.\\n\\nAt the time when the racers had to go to the pavilion to receive the\\nprizes, and all attention was directed to that point, Vronsky’s elder\\nbrother, Alexander, a colonel with heavy fringed epaulets, came up to\\nhim. He was not tall, though as broadly built as Alexey, and handsomer\\nand rosier than he; he had a red nose, and an open, drunken-looking\\nface.\\n\\n“Did you get my note?” he said. “There’s never any finding you.”\\n\\nAlexander Vronsky, in spite of the dissolute life, and in especial the\\ndrunken habits, for which he was notorious, was quite one of the court\\ncircle.\\n\\nNow, as he talked to his brother of a matter bound to be exceedingly\\ndisagreeable to him, knowing that the eyes of many people might be\\nfixed upon him, he kept a smiling countenance, as though he were\\njesting with his brother about something of little moment.\\n\\n“I got it, and I really can’t make out what _you_ are worrying yourself\\nabout,” said Alexey.\\n\\n“I’m worrying myself because the remark has just been made to me that\\nyou weren’t here, and that you were seen in Peterhof on Monday.”\\n\\n“There are matters which only concern those directly interested in\\nthem, and the matter you are so worried about is....”\\n\\n“Yes, but if so, you may as well cut the service....”\\n\\n“I beg you not to meddle, and that’s all I have to say.”\\n\\nAlexey Vronsky’s frowning face turned white, and his prominent lower\\njaw quivered, which happened rarely with him. Being a man of very warm\\nheart, he was seldom angry; but when he was angry, and when his chin\\nquivered, then, as Alexander Vronsky knew, he was dangerous. Alexander\\nVronsky smiled gaily.\\n\\n“I only wanted to give you Mother’s letter. Answer it, and don’t worry\\nabout anything just before the race. _Bonne chance,_” he added, smiling\\nand he moved away from him. But after him another friendly greeting\\nbrought Vronsky to a standstill.\\n\\n“So you won’t recognize your friends! How are you, _mon cher?_” said\\nStepan Arkadyevitch, as conspicuously brilliant in the midst of all the\\nPetersburg brilliance as he was in Moscow, his face rosy, and his\\nwhiskers sleek and glossy. “I came up yesterday, and I’m delighted that\\nI shall see your triumph. When shall we meet?”\\n\\n“Come tomorrow to the messroom,” said Vronsky, and squeezing him by the\\nsleeve of his coat, with apologies, he moved away to the center of the\\nrace course, where the horses were being led for the great\\nsteeplechase.\\n\\nThe horses who had run in the last race were being led home, steaming\\nand exhausted, by the stable-boys, and one after another the fresh\\nhorses for the coming race made their appearance, for the most part\\nEnglish racers, wearing horsecloths, and looking with their drawn-up\\nbellies like strange, huge birds. On the right was led in Frou-Frou,\\nlean and beautiful, lifting up her elastic, rather long pasterns, as\\nthough moved by springs. Not far from her they were taking the rug off\\nthe lop-eared Gladiator. The strong, exquisite, perfectly correct lines\\nof the stallion, with his superb hind-quarters and excessively short\\npasterns almost over his hoofs, attracted Vronsky’s attention in spite\\nof himself. He would have gone up to his mare, but he was again\\ndetained by an acquaintance.\\n\\n“Oh, there’s Karenin!” said the acquaintance with whom he was chatting.\\n“He’s looking for his wife, and she’s in the middle of the pavilion.\\nDidn’t you see her?”\\n\\n“No,” answered Vronsky, and without even glancing round towards the\\npavilion where his friend was pointing out Madame Karenina, he went up\\nto his mare.\\n\\nVronsky had not had time to look at the saddle, about which he had to\\ngive some direction, when the competitors were summoned to the pavilion\\nto receive their numbers and places in the row at starting. Seventeen\\nofficers, looking serious and severe, many with pale faces, met\\ntogether in the pavilion and drew the numbers. Vronsky drew the number\\nseven. The cry was heard: “Mount!”\\n\\nFeeling that with the others riding in the race, he was the center upon\\nwhich all eyes were fastened, Vronsky walked up to his mare in that\\nstate of nervous tension in which he usually became deliberate and\\ncomposed in his movements. Cord, in honor of the races, had put on his\\nbest clothes, a black coat buttoned up, a stiffly starched collar,\\nwhich propped up his cheeks, a round black hat, and top boots. He was\\ncalm and dignified as ever, and was with his own hands holding\\nFrou-Frou by both reins, standing straight in front of her. Frou-Frou\\nwas still trembling as though in a fever. Her eye, full of fire,\\nglanced sideways at Vronsky. Vronsky slipped his finger under the\\nsaddle-girth. The mare glanced aslant at him, drew up her lip, and\\ntwitched her ear. The Englishman puckered up his lips, intending to\\nindicate a smile that anyone should verify his saddling.\\n\\n“Get up; you won’t feel so excited.”\\n\\nVronsky looked round for the last time at his rivals. He knew that he\\nwould not see them during the race. Two were already riding forward to\\nthe point from which they were to start. Galtsin, a friend of Vronsky’s\\nand one of his more formidable rivals, was moving round a bay horse\\nthat would not let him mount. A little light hussar in tight riding\\nbreeches rode off at a gallop, crouched up like a cat on the saddle, in\\nimitation of English jockeys. Prince Kuzovlev sat with a white face on\\nhis thoroughbred mare from the Grabovsky stud, while an English groom\\nled her by the bridle. Vronsky and all his comrades knew Kuzovlev and\\nhis peculiarity of “weak nerves” and terrible vanity. They knew that he\\nwas afraid of everything, afraid of riding a spirited horse. But now,\\njust because it was terrible, because people broke their necks, and\\nthere was a doctor standing at each obstacle, and an ambulance with a\\ncross on it, and a sister of mercy, he had made up his mind to take\\npart in the race. Their eyes met, and Vronsky gave him a friendly and\\nencouraging nod. Only one he did not see, his chief rival, Mahotin on\\nGladiator.\\n\\n“Don’t be in a hurry,” said Cord to Vronsky, “and remember one thing:\\ndon’t hold her in at the fences, and don’t urge her on; let her go as\\nshe likes.”\\n\\n“All right, all right,” said Vronsky, taking the reins.\\n\\n“If you can, lead the race; but don’t lose heart till the last minute,\\neven if you’re behind.”\\n\\nBefore the mare had time to move, Vronsky stepped with an agile,\\nvigorous movement into the steel-toothed stirrup, and lightly and\\nfirmly seated himself on the creaking leather of the saddle. Getting\\nhis right foot in the stirrup, he smoothed the double reins, as he\\nalways did, between his fingers, and Cord let go.\\n\\nAs though she did not know which foot to put first, Frou-Frou started,\\ndragging at the reins with her long neck, and as though she were on\\nsprings, shaking her rider from side to side. Cord quickened his step,\\nfollowing him. The excited mare, trying to shake off her rider first on\\none side and then the other, pulled at the reins, and Vronsky tried in\\nvain with voice and hand to soothe her.\\n\\nThey were just reaching the dammed-up stream on their way to the\\nstarting point. Several of the riders were in front and several behind,\\nwhen suddenly Vronsky heard the sound of a horse galloping in the mud\\nbehind him, and he was overtaken by Mahotin on his white-legged,\\nlop-eared Gladiator. Mahotin smiled, showing his long teeth, but\\nVronsky looked angrily at him. He did not like him, and regarded him\\nnow as his most formidable rival. He was angry with him for galloping\\npast and exciting his mare. Frou-Frou started into a gallop, her left\\nfoot forward, made two bounds, and fretting at the tightened reins,\\npassed into a jolting trot, bumping her rider up and down. Cord, too,\\nscowled, and followed Vronsky almost at a trot 25\\n\\nThere were seventeen officers in all riding in this race. The race\\ncourse was a large three-mile ring of the form of an ellipse in front\\nof the pavilion. On this course nine obstacles had been arranged: the\\nstream, a big and solid barrier five feet high, just before the\\npavilion, a dry ditch, a ditch full of water, a precipitous slope, an\\nIrish barricade (one of the most difficult obstacles, consisting of a\\nmound fenced with brushwood, beyond which was a ditch out of sight for\\nthe horses, so that the horse had to clear both obstacles or might be\\nkilled); then two more ditches filled with water, and one dry one; and\\nthe end of the race was just facing the pavilion. But the race began\\nnot in the ring, but two hundred yards away from it, and in that part\\nof the course was the first obstacle, a dammed-up stream, seven feet in\\nbreadth, which the racers could leap or wade through as they preferred.\\n\\nThree times they were ranged ready to start, but each time some horse\\nthrust itself out of line, and they had to begin again. The umpire who\\nwas starting them, Colonel Sestrin, was beginning to lose his temper,\\nwhen at last for the fourth time he shouted “Away!” and the racers\\nstarted.\\n\\nEvery eye, every opera-glass, was turned on the brightly colored group\\nof riders at the moment they were in line to start.\\n\\n“They’re off! They’re starting!” was heard on all sides after the hush\\nof expectation.\\n\\nAnd little groups and solitary figures among the public began running\\nfrom place to place to get a better view. In the very first minute the\\nclose group of horsemen drew out, and it could be seen that they were\\napproaching the stream in twos and threes and one behind another. To\\nthe spectators it seemed as though they had all started simultaneously,\\nbut to the racers there were seconds of difference that had great value\\nto them.\\n\\nFrou-Frou, excited and over-nervous, had lost the first moment, and\\nseveral horses had started before her, but before reaching the stream,\\nVronsky, who was holding in the mare with all his force as she tugged\\nat the bridle, easily overtook three, and there were left in front of\\nhim Mahotin’s chestnut Gladiator, whose hind-quarters were moving\\nlightly and rhythmically up and down exactly in front of Vronsky, and\\nin front of all, the dainty mare Diana bearing Kuzovlev more dead than\\nalive.\\n\\nFor the first instant Vronsky was not master either of himself or his\\nmare. Up to the first obstacle, the stream, he could not guide the\\nmotions of his mare.\\n\\nGladiator and Diana came up to it together and almost at the same\\ninstant; simultaneously they rose above the stream and flew across to\\nthe other side; Frou-Frou darted after them, as if flying; but at the\\nvery moment when Vronsky felt himself in the air, he suddenly saw\\nalmost under his mare’s hoofs Kuzovlev, who was floundering with Diana\\non the further side of the stream. (Kuzovlev had let go the reins as he\\ntook the leap, and the mare had sent him flying over her head.) Those\\ndetails Vronsky learned later; at the moment all he saw was that just\\nunder him, where Frou-Frou must alight, Diana’s legs or head might be\\nin the way. But Frou-Frou drew up her legs and back in the very act of\\nleaping, like a falling cat, and, clearing the other mare, alighted\\nbeyond her.\\n\\n“O the darling!” thought Vronsky.\\n\\nAfter crossing the stream Vronsky had complete control of his mare, and\\nbegan holding her in, intending to cross the great barrier behind\\nMahotin, and to try to overtake him in the clear ground of about five\\nhundred yards that followed it.\\n\\nThe great barrier stood just in front of the imperial pavilion. The\\nTsar and the whole court and crowds of people were all gazing at\\nthem—at him, and Mahotin a length ahead of him, as they drew near the\\n“devil,” as the solid barrier was called. Vronsky was aware of those\\neyes fastened upon him from all sides, but he saw nothing except the\\nears and neck of his own mare, the ground racing to meet him, and the\\nback and white legs of Gladiator beating time swiftly before him, and\\nkeeping always the same distance ahead. Gladiator rose, with no sound\\nof knocking against anything. With a wave of his short tail he\\ndisappeared from Vronsky’s sight.\\n\\n“Bravo!” cried a voice.\\n\\nAt the same instant, under Vronsky’s eyes, right before him flashed the\\npalings of the barrier. Without the slightest change in her action his\\nmare flew over it; the palings vanished, and he heard only a crash\\nbehind him. The mare, excited by Gladiator’s keeping ahead, had risen\\ntoo soon before the barrier, and grazed it with her hind hoofs. But her\\npace never changed, and Vronsky, feeling a spatter of mud in his face,\\nrealized that he was once more the same distance from Gladiator. Once\\nmore he perceived in front of him the same back and short tail, and\\nagain the same swiftly moving white legs that got no further away.\\n\\nAt the very moment when Vronsky thought that now was the time to\\novertake Mahotin, Frou-Frou herself, understanding his thoughts,\\nwithout any incitement on his part, gained ground considerably, and\\nbegan getting alongside of Mahotin on the most favorable side, close to\\nthe inner cord. Mahotin would not let her pass that side. Vronsky had\\nhardly formed the thought that he could perhaps pass on the outer side,\\nwhen Frou-Frou shifted her pace and began overtaking him on the other\\nside. Frou-Frou’s shoulder, beginning by now to be dark with sweat, was\\neven with Gladiator’s back. For a few lengths they moved evenly. But\\nbefore the obstacle they were approaching, Vronsky began working at the\\nreins, anxious to avoid having to take the outer circle, and swiftly\\npassed Mahotin just upon the declivity. He caught a glimpse of his\\nmud-stained face as he flashed by. He even fancied that he smiled.\\nVronsky passed Mahotin, but he was immediately aware of him close upon\\nhim, and he never ceased hearing the even-thudding hoofs and the rapid\\nand still quite fresh breathing of Gladiator.\\n\\nThe next two obstacles, the water course and the barrier, were easily\\ncrossed, but Vronsky began to hear the snorting and thud of Gladiator\\ncloser upon him. He urged on his mare, and to his delight felt that she\\neasily quickened her pace, and the thud of Gladiator’s hoofs was again\\nheard at the same distance away.\\n\\nVronsky was at the head of the race, just as he wanted to be and as\\nCord had advised, and now he felt sure of being the winner. His\\nexcitement, his delight, and his tenderness for Frou-Frou grew keener\\nand keener. He longed to look round again, but he did not dare do this,\\nand tried to be cool and not to urge on his mare so to keep the same\\nreserve of force in her as he felt that Gladiator still kept. There\\nremained only one obstacle, the most difficult; if he could cross it\\nahead of the others he would come in first. He was flying towards the\\nIrish barricade, Frou-Frou and he both together saw the barricade in\\nthe distance, and both the man and the mare had a moment’s hesitation.\\nHe saw the uncertainty in the mare’s ears and lifted the whip, but at\\nthe same time felt that his fears were groundless; the mare knew what\\nwas wanted. She quickened her pace and rose smoothly, just as he had\\nfancied she would, and as she left the ground gave herself up to the\\nforce of her rush, which carried her far beyond the ditch; and with the\\nsame rhythm, without effort, with the same leg forward, Frou-Frou fell\\nback into her pace again.\\n\\n“Bravo, Vronsky!” he heard shouts from a knot of men—he knew they were\\nhis friends in the regiment—who were standing at the obstacle. He could\\nnot fail to recognize Yashvin’s voice though he did not see him.\\n\\n“O my sweet!” he said inwardly to Frou-Frou, as he listened for what\\nwas happening behind. “He’s cleared it!” he thought, catching the thud\\nof Gladiator’s hoofs behind him. There remained only the last ditch,\\nfilled with water and five feet wide. Vronsky did not even look at it,\\nbut anxious to get in a long way first began sawing away at the reins,\\nlifting the mare’s head and letting it go in time with her paces. He\\nfelt that the mare was at her very last reserve of strength; not her\\nneck and shoulders merely were wet, but the sweat was standing in drops\\non her mane, her head, her sharp ears, and her breath came in short,\\nsharp gasps. But he knew that she had strength left more than enough\\nfor the remaining five hundred yards. It was only from feeling himself\\nnearer the ground and from the peculiar smoothness of his motion that\\nVronsky knew how greatly the mare had quickened her pace. She flew over\\nthe ditch as though not noticing it. She flew over it like a bird; but\\nat the same instant Vronsky, to his horror, felt that he had failed to\\nkeep up with the mare’s pace, that he had, he did not know how, made a\\nfearful, unpardonable mistake, in recovering his seat in the saddle.\\nAll at once his position had shifted and he knew that something awful\\nhad happened. He could not yet make out what had happened, when the\\nwhite legs of a chestnut horse flashed by close to him, and Mahotin\\npassed at a swift gallop. Vronsky was touching the ground with one\\nfoot, and his mare was sinking on that foot. He just had time to free\\nhis leg when she fell on one side, gasping painfully, and, making vain\\nefforts to rise with her delicate, soaking neck, she fluttered on the\\nground at his feet like a shot bird. The clumsy movement made by\\nVronsky had broken her back. But that he only knew much later. At that\\nmoment he knew only that Mahotin had flown swiftly by, while he stood\\nstaggering alone on the muddy, motionless ground, and Frou-Frou lay\\ngasping before him, bending her head back and gazing at him with her\\nexquisite eyes. Still unable to realize what had happened, Vronsky\\ntugged at his mare’s reins. Again she struggled all over like a fish,\\nand her shoulders setting the saddle heaving, she rose on her front\\nlegs but unable to lift her back, she quivered all over and again fell\\non her side. With a face hideous with passion, his lower jaw trembling,\\nand his cheeks white, Vronsky kicked her with his heel in the stomach\\nand again fell to tugging at the rein. She did not stir, but thrusting\\nher nose into the ground, she simply gazed at her master with her\\nspeaking eyes.\\n\\n“A—a—a!” groaned Vronsky, clutching at his head. “Ah! what have I\\ndone!” he cried. “The race lost! And my fault! shameful, unpardonable!\\nAnd the poor darling, ruined mare! Ah! what have I done!”\\n\\nA crowd of men, a doctor and his assistant, the officers of his\\nregiment, ran up to him. To his misery he felt that he was whole and\\nunhurt. The mare had broken her back, and it was decided to shoot her.\\nVronsky could not answer questions, could not speak to anyone. He\\nturned, and without picking up his cap that had fallen off, walked away\\nfrom the race course, not knowing where he was going. He felt utterly\\nwretched. For the first time in his life he knew the bitterest sort of\\nmisfortune, misfortune beyond remedy, and caused by his own fault.\\n\\nYashvin overtook him with his cap, and led him home, and half an hour\\nlater Vronsky had regained his self-possession. But the memory of that\\nrace remained for long in his heart, the cruelest and bitterest memory\\nof his life 26\\n\\nThe external relations of Alexey Alexandrovitch and his wife had\\nremained unchanged. The sole difference lay in the fact that he was\\nmore busily occupied than ever. As in former years, at the beginning of\\nthe spring he had gone to a foreign watering-place for the sake of his\\nhealth, deranged by the winter’s work that every year grew heavier. And\\njust as always he returned in July and at once fell to work as usual\\nwith increased energy. As usual, too, his wife had moved for the summer\\nto a villa out of town, while he remained in Petersburg. From the date\\nof their conversation after the party at Princess Tverskaya’s he had\\nnever spoken again to Anna of his suspicions and his jealousies, and\\nthat habitual tone of his bantering mimicry was the most convenient\\ntone possible for his present attitude to his wife. He was a little\\ncolder to his wife. He simply seemed to be slightly displeased with her\\nfor that first midnight conversation, which she had repelled. In his\\nattitude to her there was a shade of vexation, but nothing more. “You\\nwould not be open with me,” he seemed to say, mentally addressing her;\\n“so much the worse for you. Now you may beg as you please, but I won’t\\nbe open with you. So much the worse for you!” he said mentally, like a\\nman who, after vainly attempting to extinguish a fire, should fly in a\\nrage with his vain efforts and say, “Oh, very well then! you shall burn\\nfor this!” This man, so subtle and astute in official life, did not\\nrealize all the senselessness of such an attitude to his wife. He did\\nnot realize it, because it was too terrible to him to realize his\\nactual position, and he shut down and locked and sealed up in his heart\\nthat secret place where lay hid his feelings towards his family, that\\nis, his wife and son. He who had been such a careful father, had from\\nthe end of that winter become peculiarly frigid to his son, and adopted\\nto him just the same bantering tone he used with his wife. “Aha, young\\nman!” was the greeting with which he met him.\\n\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch asserted and believed that he had never in any\\nprevious year had so much official business as that year. But he was\\nnot aware that he sought work for himself that year, that this was one\\nof the means for keeping shut that secret place where lay hid his\\nfeelings towards his wife and son and his thoughts about them, which\\nbecame more terrible the longer they lay there. If anyone had had the\\nright to ask Alexey Alexandrovitch what he thought of his wife’s\\nbehavior, the mild and peaceable Alexey Alexandrovitch would have made\\nno answer, but he would have been greatly angered with any man who\\nshould question him on that subject. For this reason there positively\\ncame into Alexey Alexandrovitch’s face a look of haughtiness and\\nseverity whenever anyone inquired after his wife’s health. Alexey\\nAlexandrovitch did not want to think at all about his wife’s behavior,\\nand he actually succeeded in not thinking about it at all.\\n\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch’s permanent summer villa was in Peterhof, and the\\nCountess Lidia Ivanovna used as a rule to spend the summer there, close\\nto Anna, and constantly seeing her. That year Countess Lidia Ivanovna\\ndeclined to settle in Peterhof, was not once at Anna Arkadyevna’s, and\\nin conversation with Alexey Alexandrovitch hinted at the unsuitability\\nof Anna’s close intimacy with Betsy and Vronsky. Alexey Alexandrovitch\\nsternly cut her short, roundly declaring his wife to be above\\nsuspicion, and from that time began to avoid Countess Lidia Ivanovna.\\nHe did not want to see, and did not see, that many people in society\\ncast dubious glances on his wife; he did not want to understand, and\\ndid not understand, why his wife had so particularly insisted on\\nstaying at Tsarskoe, where Betsy was staying, and not far from the camp\\nof Vronsky’s regiment. He did not allow himself to think about it, and\\nhe did not think about it; but all the same though he never admitted it\\nto himself, and had no proofs, not even suspicious evidence, in the\\nbottom of his heart he knew beyond all doubt that he was a deceived\\nhusband, and he was profoundly miserable about it.\\n\\nHow often during those eight years of happy life with his wife Alexey\\nAlexandrovitch had looked at other men’s faithless wives and other\\ndeceived husbands and asked himself: “How can people descend to that?\\nhow is it they don’t put an end to such a hideous position?” But now,\\nwhen the misfortune had come upon himself, he was so far from thinking\\nof putting an end to the position that he would not recognize it at\\nall, would not recognize it just because it was too awful, too\\nunnatural.\\n\\nSince his return from abroad Alexey Alexandrovitch had twice been at\\ntheir country villa. Once he dined there, another time he spent the\\nevening there with a party of friends, but he had not once stayed the\\nnight there, as it had been his habit to do in previous years.\\n\\nThe day of the races had been a very busy day for Alexey\\nAlexandrovitch; but when mentally sketching out the day in the morning,\\nhe made up his mind to go to their country house to see his wife\\nimmediately after dinner, and from there to the races, which all the\\nCourt were to witness, and at which he was bound to be present. He was\\ngoing to see his wife, because he had determined to see her once a week\\nto keep up appearances. And besides, on that day, as it was the\\nfifteenth, he had to give his wife some money for her expenses,\\naccording to their usual arrangement.\\n\\nWith his habitual control over his thoughts, though he thought all this\\nabout his wife, he did not let his thoughts stray further in regard to\\nher.\\n\\nThat morning was a very full one for Alexey Alexandrovitch. The evening\\nbefore, Countess Lidia Ivanovna had sent him a pamphlet by a celebrated\\ntraveler in China, who was staying in Petersburg, and with it she\\nenclosed a note begging him to see the traveler himself, as he was an\\nextremely interesting person from various points of view, and likely to\\nbe useful. Alexey Alexandrovitch had not had time to read the pamphlet\\nthrough in the evening, and finished it in the morning. Then people\\nbegan arriving with petitions, and there came the reports, interviews,\\nappointments, dismissals, apportionment of rewards, pensions, grants,\\nnotes, the workaday round, as Alexey Alexandrovitch called it, that\\nalways took up so much time. Then there was private business of his\\nown, a visit from the doctor and the steward who managed his property.\\nThe steward did not take up much time. He simply gave Alexey\\nAlexandrovitch the money he needed together with a brief statement of\\nthe position of his affairs, which was not altogether satisfactory, as\\nit had happened that during that year, owing to increased expenses,\\nmore had been paid out than usual, and there was a deficit. But the\\ndoctor, a celebrated Petersburg doctor, who was an intimate\\nacquaintance of Alexey Alexandrovitch, took up a great deal of time.\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch had not expected him that day, and was surprised\\nat his visit, and still more so when the doctor questioned him very\\ncarefully about his health, listened to his breathing, and tapped at\\nhis liver. Alexey Alexandrovitch did not know that his friend Lidia\\nIvanovna, noticing that he was not as well as usual that year, had\\nbegged the doctor to go and examine him. “Do this for my sake,” the\\nCountess Lidia Ivanovna had said to him.\\n\\n“I will do it for the sake of Russia, countess,” replied the doctor.\\n\\n“A priceless man!” said the Countess Lidia Ivanovna.\\n\\nThe doctor was extremely dissatisfied with Alexey Alexandrovitch. He\\nfound the liver considerably enlarged, and the digestive powers\\nweakened, while the course of mineral waters had been quite without\\neffect. He prescribed more physical exercise as far as possible, and as\\nfar as possible less mental strain, and above all no worry—in other\\nwords, just what was as much out of Alexey Alexandrovitch’s power as\\nabstaining from breathing. Then he withdrew, leaving in Alexey\\nAlexandrovitch an unpleasant sense that something was wrong with him,\\nand that there was no chance of curing it.\\n\\nAs he was coming away, the doctor chanced to meet on the staircase an\\nacquaintance of his, Sludin, who was secretary of Alexey\\nAlexandrovitch’s department. They had been comrades at the university,\\nand though they rarely met, they thought highly of each other and were\\nexcellent friends, and so there was no one to whom the doctor would\\nhave given his opinion of a patient so freely as to Sludin.\\n\\n“How glad I am you’ve been seeing him!” said Sludin. “He’s not well,\\nand I fancy.... Well, what do you think of him?”\\n\\n“I’ll tell you,” said the doctor, beckoning over Sludin’s head to his\\ncoachman to bring the carriage round. “It’s just this,” said the\\ndoctor, taking a finger of his kid glove in his white hands and pulling\\nit, “if you don’t strain the strings, and then try to break them,\\nyou’ll find it a difficult job; but strain a string to its very utmost,\\nand the mere weight of one finger on the strained string will snap it.\\nAnd with his close assiduity, his conscientious devotion to his work,\\nhe’s strained to the utmost; and there’s some outside burden weighing\\non him, and not a light one,” concluded the doctor, raising his\\neyebrows significantly. “Will you be at the races?” he added, as he\\nsank into his seat in the carriage.\\n\\n“Yes, yes, to be sure; it does waste a lot of time,” the doctor\\nresponded vaguely to some reply of Sludin’s he had not caught.\\n\\nDirectly after the doctor, who had taken up so much time, came the\\ncelebrated traveler, and Alexey Alexandrovitch, by means of the\\npamphlet he had only just finished reading and his previous\\nacquaintance with the subject, impressed the traveler by the depth of\\nhis knowledge of the subject and the breadth and enlightenment of his\\nview of it.\\n\\nAt the same time as the traveler there was announced a provincial\\nmarshal of nobility on a visit to Petersburg, with whom Alexey\\nAlexandrovitch had to have some conversation. After his departure, he\\nhad to finish the daily routine of business with his secretary, and\\nthen he still had to drive round to call on a certain great personage\\non a matter of grave and serious import. Alexey Alexandrovitch only\\njust managed to be back by five o’clock, his dinner-hour, and after\\ndining with his secretary, he invited him to drive with him to his\\ncountry villa and to the races.\\n\\nThough he did not acknowledge it to himself, Alexey Alexandrovitch\\nalways tried nowadays to secure the presence of a third person in his\\ninterviews with his wife 27\\n\\nAnna was upstairs, standing before the looking-glass, and, with\\nAnnushka’s assistance, pinning the last ribbon on her gown when she\\nheard carriage wheels crunching the gravel at the entrance.\\n\\n“It’s too early for Betsy,” she thought, and glancing out of the window\\nshe caught sight of the carriage and the black hat of Alexey\\nAlexandrovitch, and the ears that she knew so well sticking up each\\nside of it. “How unlucky! Can he be going to stay the night?” she\\nwondered, and the thought of all that might come of such a chance\\nstruck her as so awful and terrible that, without dwelling on it for a\\nmoment, she went down to meet him with a bright and radiant face; and\\nconscious of the presence of that spirit of falsehood and deceit in\\nherself that she had come to know of late, she abandoned herself to\\nthat spirit and began talking, hardly knowing what she was saying.\\n\\n“Ah, how nice of you!” she said, giving her husband her hand, and\\ngreeting Sludin, who was like one of the family, with a smile. “You’re\\nstaying the night, I hope?” was the first word the spirit of falsehood\\nprompted her to utter; “and now we’ll go together. Only it’s a pity\\nI’ve promised Betsy. She’s coming for me.”\\n\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch knit his brows at Betsy’s name.\\n\\n“Oh, I’m not going to separate the inseparables,” he said in his usual\\nbantering tone. “I’m going with Mihail Vassilievitch. I’m ordered\\nexercise by the doctors too. I’ll walk, and fancy myself at the springs\\nagain.”\\n\\n“There’s no hurry,” said Anna. “Would you like tea?”\\n\\nShe rang.\\n\\n“Bring in tea, and tell Seryozha that Alexey Alexandrovitch is here.\\nWell, tell me, how have you been? Mihail Vassilievitch, you’ve not been\\nto see me before. Look how lovely it is out on the terrace,” she said,\\nturning first to one and then to the other.\\n\\nShe spoke very simply and naturally, but too much and too fast. She was\\nthe more aware of this from noticing in the inquisitive look Mihail\\nVassilievitch turned on her that he was, as it were, keeping watch on\\nher.\\n\\nMihail Vassilievitch promptly went out on the terrace.\\n\\nShe sat down beside her husband.\\n\\n“You don’t look quite well,” she said.\\n\\n“Yes,” he said; “the doctor’s been with me today and wasted an hour of\\nmy time. I feel that someone of our friends must have sent him: my\\nhealth’s so precious, it seems.”\\n\\n“No; what did he say?”\\n\\nShe questioned him about his health and what he had been doing, and\\ntried to persuade him to take a rest and come out to her.\\n\\nAll this she said brightly, rapidly, and with a peculiar brilliance in\\nher eyes. But Alexey Alexandrovitch did not now attach any special\\nsignificance to this tone of hers. He heard only her words and gave\\nthem only the direct sense they bore. And he answered simply, though\\njestingly. There was nothing remarkable in all this conversation, but\\nnever after could Anna recall this brief scene without an agonizing\\npang of shame.\\n\\nSeryozha came in preceded by his governess. If Alexey Alexandrovitch\\nhad allowed himself to observe he would have noticed the timid and\\nbewildered eyes with which Seryozha glanced first at his father and\\nthen at his mother. But he would not see anything, and he did not see\\nit.\\n\\n“Ah, the young man! He’s grown. Really, he’s getting quite a man. How\\nare you, young man?”\\n\\nAnd he gave his hand to the scared child. Seryozha had been shy of his\\nfather before, and now, ever since Alexey Alexandrovitch had taken to\\ncalling him young man, and since that insoluble question had occurred\\nto him whether Vronsky were a friend or a foe, he avoided his father.\\nHe looked round towards his mother as though seeking shelter. It was\\nonly with his mother that he was at ease. Meanwhile, Alexey\\nAlexandrovitch was holding his son by the shoulder while he was\\nspeaking to the governess, and Seryozha was so miserably uncomfortable\\nthat Anna saw he was on the point of tears.\\n\\nAnna, who had flushed a little the instant her son came in, noticing\\nthat Seryozha was uncomfortable, got up hurriedly, took Alexey\\nAlexandrovitch’s hand from her son’s shoulder, and kissing the boy, led\\nhim out onto the terrace, and quickly came back.\\n\\n“It’s time to start, though,” said she, glancing at her watch. “How is\\nit Betsy doesn’t come?...”\\n\\n“Yes,” said Alexey Alexandrovitch, and getting up, he folded his hands\\nand cracked his fingers. “I’ve come to bring you some money, too, for\\nnightingales, we know, can’t live on fairy tales,” he said. “You want\\nit, I expect?”\\n\\n“No, I don’t ... yes, I do,” she said, not looking at him, and\\ncrimsoning to the roots of her hair. “But you’ll come back here after\\nthe races, I suppose?”\\n\\n“Oh, yes!” answered Alexey Alexandrovitch. “And here’s the glory of\\nPeterhof, Princess Tverskaya,” he added, looking out of the window at\\nthe elegant English carriage with the tiny seats placed extremely high.\\n“What elegance! Charming! Well, let us be starting too, then.”\\n\\nPrincess Tverskaya did not get out of her carriage, but her groom, in\\nhigh boots, a cape, and black hat, darted out at the entrance.\\n\\n“I’m going; good-bye!” said Anna, and kissing her son, she went up to\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch and held out her hand to him. “It was ever so\\nnice of you to come.”\\n\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch kissed her hand.\\n\\n“Well, _au revoir_, then! You’ll come back for some tea; that’s\\ndelightful!” she said, and went out, gay and radiant. But as soon as\\nshe no longer saw him, she was aware of the spot on her hand that his\\nlips had touched, and she shuddered with repulsion 28\\n\\nWhen Alexey Alexandrovitch reached the race-course, Anna was already\\nsitting in the pavilion beside Betsy, in that pavilion where all the\\nhighest society had gathered. She caught sight of her husband in the\\ndistance. Two men, her husband and her lover, were the two centers of\\nher existence, and unaided by her external senses she was aware of\\ntheir nearness. She was aware of her husband approaching a long way\\noff, and she could not help following him in the surging crowd in the\\nmidst of which he was moving. She watched his progress towards the\\npavilion, saw him now responding condescendingly to an ingratiating\\nbow, now exchanging friendly, nonchalant greetings with his equals, now\\nassiduously trying to catch the eye of some great one of this world,\\nand taking off his big round hat that squeezed the tips of his ears.\\nAll these ways of his she knew, and all were hateful to her. “Nothing\\nbut ambition, nothing but the desire to get on, that’s all there is in\\nhis soul,” she thought; “as for these lofty ideals, love of culture,\\nreligion, they are only so many tools for getting on.”\\n\\nFrom his glances towards the ladies’ pavilion (he was staring straight\\nat her, but did not distinguish his wife in the sea of muslin, ribbons,\\nfeathers, parasols and flowers) she saw that he was looking for her,\\nbut she purposely avoided noticing him.\\n\\n“Alexey Alexandrovitch!” Princess Betsy called to him; “I’m sure you\\ndon’t see your wife: here she is.”\\n\\nHe smiled his chilly smile.\\n\\n“There’s so much splendor here that one’s eyes are dazzled,” he said,\\nand he went into the pavilion. He smiled to his wife as a man should\\nsmile on meeting his wife after only just parting from her, and greeted\\nthe princess and other acquaintances, giving to each what was due—that\\nis to say, jesting with the ladies and dealing out friendly greetings\\namong the men. Below, near the pavilion, was standing an\\nadjutant-general of whom Alexey Alexandrovitch had a high opinion,\\nnoted for his intelligence and culture. Alexey Alexandrovitch entered\\ninto conversation with him.\\n\\nThere was an interval between the races, and so nothing hindered\\nconversation. The adjutant-general expressed his disapproval of races.\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch replied defending them. Anna heard his high,\\nmeasured tones, not losing one word, and every word struck her as\\nfalse, and stabbed her ears with pain.\\n\\nWhen the three-mile steeplechase was beginning, she bent forward and\\ngazed with fixed eyes at Vronsky as he went up to his horse and\\nmounted, and at the same time she heard that loathsome, never-ceasing\\nvoice of her husband. She was in an agony of terror for Vronsky, but a\\nstill greater agony was the never-ceasing, as it seemed to her, stream\\nof her husband’s shrill voice with its familiar intonations.\\n\\n“I’m a wicked woman, a lost woman,” she thought; “but I don’t like\\nlying, I can’t endure falsehood, while as for _him_ (her husband) it’s\\nthe breath of his life—falsehood. He knows all about it, he sees it\\nall; what does he care if he can talk so calmly? If he were to kill me,\\nif he were to kill Vronsky, I might respect him. No, all he wants is\\nfalsehood and propriety,” Anna said to herself, not considering exactly\\nwhat it was she wanted of her husband, and how she would have liked to\\nsee him behave. She did not understand either that Alexey\\nAlexandrovitch’s peculiar loquacity that day, so exasperating to her,\\nwas merely the expression of his inward distress and uneasiness. As a\\nchild that has been hurt skips about, putting all his muscles into\\nmovement to drown the pain, in the same way Alexey Alexandrovitch\\nneeded mental exercise to drown the thoughts of his wife that in her\\npresence and in Vronsky’s, and with the continual iteration of his\\nname, would force themselves on his attention. And it was as natural\\nfor him to talk well and cleverly, as it is natural for a child to skip\\nabout. He was saying:\\n\\n“Danger in the races of officers, of cavalry men, is an essential\\nelement in the race. If England can point to the most brilliant feats\\nof cavalry in military history, it is simply owing to the fact that she\\nhas historically developed this force both in beasts and in men. Sport\\nhas, in my opinion, a great value, and as is always the case, we see\\nnothing but what is most superficial.”\\n\\n“It’s not superficial,” said Princess Tverskaya. “One of the officers,\\nthey say, has broken two ribs.”\\n\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch smiled his smile, which uncovered his teeth, but\\nrevealed nothing more.\\n\\n“We’ll admit, princess, that that’s not superficial,” he said, “but\\ninternal. But that’s not the point,” and he turned again to the general\\nwith whom he was talking seriously; “we mustn’t forget that those who\\nare taking part in the race are military men, who have chosen that\\ncareer, and one must allow that every calling has its disagreeable\\nside. It forms an integral part of the duties of an officer. Low\\nsports, such as prize-fighting or Spanish bull-fights, are a sign of\\nbarbarity. But specialized trials of skill are a sign of development.”\\n\\n“No, I shan’t come another time; it’s too upsetting,” said Princess\\nBetsy. “Isn’t it, Anna?”\\n\\n“It is upsetting, but one can’t tear oneself away,” said another lady.\\n“If I’d been a Roman woman I should never have missed a single circus.”\\n\\nAnna said nothing, and keeping her opera-glass up, gazed always at the\\nsame spot.\\n\\nAt that moment a tall general walked through the pavilion. Breaking off\\nwhat he was saying, Alexey Alexandrovitch got up hurriedly, though with\\ndignity, and bowed low to the general.\\n\\n“You’re not racing?” the officer asked, chaffing him.\\n\\n“My race is a harder one,” Alexey Alexandrovitch responded\\ndeferentially.\\n\\nAnd though the answer meant nothing, the general looked as though he\\nhad heard a witty remark from a witty man, and fully relished _la\\npointe de la sauce_.\\n\\n“There are two aspects,” Alexey Alexandrovitch resumed: “those who take\\npart and those who look on; and love for such spectacles is an\\nunmistakable proof of a low degree of development in the spectator, I\\nadmit, but....”\\n\\n“Princess, bets!” sounded Stepan Arkadyevitch’s voice from below,\\naddressing Betsy. “Who’s your favorite?”\\n\\n“Anna and I are for Kuzovlev,” replied Betsy.\\n\\n“I’m for Vronsky. A pair of gloves?”\\n\\n“Done!”\\n\\n“But it is a pretty sight, isn’t it?”\\n\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch paused while there was talking about him, but he\\nbegan again directly.\\n\\n“I admit that manly sports do not....” he was continuing.\\n\\nBut at that moment the racers started, and all conversation ceased.\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch too was silent, and everyone stood up and turned\\ntowards the stream. Alexey Alexandrovitch took no interest in the race,\\nand so he did not watch the racers, but fell listlessly to scanning the\\nspectators with his weary eyes. His eyes rested upon Anna.\\n\\nHer face was white and set. She was obviously seeing nothing and no one\\nbut one man. Her hand had convulsively clutched her fan, and she held\\nher breath. He looked at her and hastily turned away, scrutinizing\\nother faces.\\n\\n“But here’s this lady too, and others very much moved as well; it’s\\nvery natural,” Alexey Alexandrovitch told himself. He tried not to look\\nat her, but unconsciously his eyes were drawn to her. He examined that\\nface again, trying not to read what was so plainly written on it, and\\nagainst his own will, with horror read on it what he did not want to\\nknow.\\n\\nThe first fall—Kuzovlev’s, at the stream—agitated everyone, but Alexey\\nAlexandrovitch saw distinctly on Anna’s pale, triumphant face that the\\nman she was watching had not fallen. When, after Mahotin and Vronsky\\nhad cleared the worst barrier, the next officer had been thrown\\nstraight on his head at it and fatally injured, and a shudder of horror\\npassed over the whole public, Alexey Alexandrovitch saw that Anna did\\nnot even notice it, and had some difficulty in realizing what they were\\ntalking of about her. But more and more often, and with greater\\npersistence, he watched her. Anna, wholly engrossed as she was with the\\nrace, became aware of her husband’s cold eyes fixed upon her from one\\nside.\\n\\nShe glanced round for an instant, looked inquiringly at him, and with a\\nslight frown turned away again.\\n\\n“Ah, I don’t care!” she seemed to say to him, and she did not once\\nglance at him again.\\n\\nThe race was an unlucky one, and of the seventeen officers who rode in\\nit more than half were thrown and hurt. Towards the end of the race\\neveryone was in a state of agitation, which was intensified by the fact\\nthat the Tsar was displeased 29\\n\\nEveryone was loudly expressing disapprobation, everyone was repeating a\\nphrase someone had uttered—“The lions and gladiators will be the next\\nthing,” and everyone was feeling horrified; so that when Vronsky fell\\nto the ground, and Anna moaned aloud, there was nothing very out of the\\nway in it. But afterwards a change came over Anna’s face which really\\nwas beyond decorum. She utterly lost her head. She began fluttering\\nlike a caged bird, at one moment would have got up and moved away, at\\nthe next turned to Betsy.\\n\\n“Let us go, let us go!” she said.\\n\\nBut Betsy did not hear her. She was bending down, talking to a general\\nwho had come up to her.\\n\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch went up to Anna and courteously offered her his\\narm.\\n\\n“Let us go, if you like,” he said in French, but Anna was listening to\\nthe general and did not notice her husband.\\n\\n“He’s broken his leg too, so they say,” the general was saying. “This\\nis beyond everything.”\\n\\nWithout answering her husband, Anna lifted her opera-glass and gazed\\ntowards the place where Vronsky had fallen; but it was so far off, and\\nthere was such a crowd of people about it, that she could make out\\nnothing. She laid down the opera-glass, and would have moved away, but\\nat that moment an officer galloped up and made some announcement to the\\nTsar. Anna craned forward, listening.\\n\\n“Stiva! Stiva!” she cried to her brother.\\n\\nBut her brother did not hear her. Again she would have moved away.\\n\\n“Once more I offer you my arm if you want to be going,” said Alexey\\nAlexandrovitch, reaching towards her hand.\\n\\nShe drew back from him with aversion, and without looking in his face\\nanswered:\\n\\n“No, no, let me be, I’ll stay.”\\n\\nShe saw now that from the place of Vronsky’s accident an officer was\\nrunning across the course towards the pavilion. Betsy waved her\\nhandkerchief to him. The officer brought the news that the rider was\\nnot killed, but the horse had broken its back.\\n\\nOn hearing this Anna sat down hurriedly, and hid her face in her fan.\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch saw that she was weeping, and could not control\\nher tears, nor even the sobs that were shaking her bosom. Alexey\\nAlexandrovitch stood so as to screen her, giving her time to recover\\nherself.\\n\\n“For the third time I offer you my arm,” he said to her after a little\\ntime, turning to her. Anna gazed at him and did not know what to say.\\nPrincess Betsy came to her rescue.\\n\\n“No, Alexey Alexandrovitch; I brought Anna and I promised to take her\\nhome,” put in Betsy.\\n\\n“Excuse me, princess,” he said, smiling courteously but looking her\\nvery firmly in the face, “but I see that Anna’s not very well, and I\\nwish her to come home with me.”\\n\\nAnna looked about her in a frightened way, got up submissively, and\\nlaid her hand on her husband’s arm.\\n\\n“I’ll send to him and find out, and let you know,” Betsy whispered to\\nher.\\n\\nAs they left the pavilion, Alexey Alexandrovitch, as always, talked to\\nthose he met, and Anna had, as always, to talk and answer; but she was\\nutterly beside herself, and moved hanging on her husband’s arm as\\nthough in a dream.\\n\\n“Is he killed or not? Is it true? Will he come or not? Shall I see him\\ntoday?” she was thinking.\\n\\nShe took her seat in her husband’s carriage in silence, and in silence\\ndrove out of the crowd of carriages. In spite of all he had seen,\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch still did not allow himself to consider his\\nwife’s real condition. He merely saw the outward symptoms. He saw that\\nshe was behaving unbecomingly, and considered it his duty to tell her\\nso. But it was very difficult for him not to say more, to tell her\\nnothing but that. He opened his mouth to tell her she had behaved\\nunbecomingly, but he could not help saying something utterly different.\\n\\n“What an inclination we all have, though, for these cruel spectacles,”\\nhe said. “I observe....”\\n\\n“Eh? I don’t understand,” said Anna contemptuously.\\n\\nHe was offended, and at once began to say what he had meant to say.\\n\\n“I am obliged to tell you,” he began.\\n\\n“So now we are to have it out,” she thought, and she felt frightened.\\n\\n“I am obliged to tell you that your behavior has been unbecoming\\ntoday,” he said to her in French.\\n\\n“In what way has my behavior been unbecoming?” she said aloud, turning\\nher head swiftly and looking him straight in the face, not with the\\nbright expression that seemed covering something, but with a look of\\ndetermination, under which she concealed with difficulty the dismay she\\nwas feeling.\\n\\n“Mind,” he said, pointing to the open window opposite the coachman.\\n\\nHe got up and pulled up the window.\\n\\n“What did you consider unbecoming?” she repeated.\\n\\n“The despair you were unable to conceal at the accident to one of the\\nriders.”\\n\\nHe waited for her to answer, but she was silent, looking straight\\nbefore her.\\n\\n“I have already begged you so to conduct yourself in society that even\\nmalicious tongues can find nothing to say against you. There was a time\\nwhen I spoke of your inward attitude, but I am not speaking of that\\nnow. Now I speak only of your external attitude. You have behaved\\nimproperly, and I would wish it not to occur again.”\\n\\nShe did not hear half of what he was saying; she felt panic-stricken\\nbefore him, and was thinking whether it was true that Vronsky was not\\nkilled. Was it of him they were speaking when they said the rider was\\nunhurt, but the horse had broken its back? She merely smiled with a\\npretense of irony when he finished, and made no reply, because she had\\nnot heard what he said. Alexey Alexandrovitch had begun to speak\\nboldly, but as he realized plainly what he was speaking of, the dismay\\nshe was feeling infected him too. He saw the smile, and a strange\\nmisapprehension came over him.\\n\\n“She is smiling at my suspicions. Yes, she will tell me directly what\\nshe told me before; that there is no foundation for my suspicions, that\\nit’s absurd.”\\n\\nAt that moment, when the revelation of everything was hanging over him,\\nthere was nothing he expected so much as that she would answer\\nmockingly as before that his suspicions were absurd and utterly\\ngroundless. So terrible to him was what he knew that now he was ready\\nto believe anything. But the expression of her face, scared and gloomy,\\ndid not now promise even deception.\\n\\n“Possibly I was mistaken,” said he. “If so, I beg your pardon.”\\n\\n“No, you were not mistaken,” she said deliberately, looking desperately\\ninto his cold face. “You were not mistaken. I was, and I could not help\\nbeing in despair. I hear you, but I am thinking of him. I love him, I\\nam his mistress; I can’t bear you; I’m afraid of you, and I hate\\nyou.... You can do what you like to me.”\\n\\nAnd dropping back into the corner of the carriage, she broke into sobs,\\nhiding her face in her hands. Alexey Alexandrovitch did not stir, and\\nkept looking straight before him. But his whole face suddenly bore the\\nsolemn rigidity of the dead, and his expression did not change during\\nthe whole time of the drive home. On reaching the house he turned his\\nhead to her, still with the same expression.\\n\\n“Very well! But I expect a strict observance of the external forms of\\npropriety till such time”—his voice shook—“as I may take measures to\\nsecure my honor and communicate them to you.”\\n\\nHe got out first and helped her to get out. Before the servants he\\npressed her hand, took his seat in the carriage, and drove back to\\nPetersburg. Immediately afterwards a footman came from Princess Betsy\\nand brought Anna a note.\\n\\n“I sent to Alexey to find out how he is, and he writes me he is quite\\nwell and unhurt, but in despair.”\\n\\n“So _he_ will be here,” she thought. “What a good thing I told him\\nall!”\\n\\nShe glanced at her watch. She had still three hours to wait, and the\\nmemories of their last meeting set her blood in flame.\\n\\n“My God, how light it is! It’s dreadful, but I do love to see his face,\\nand I do love this fantastic light.... My husband! Oh! yes.... Well,\\nthank God! everything’s over with him 30\\n\\nIn the little German watering-place to which the Shtcherbatskys had\\nbetaken themselves, as in all places indeed where people are gathered\\ntogether, the usual process, as it were, of the crystallization of\\nsociety went on, assigning to each member of that society a definite\\nand unalterable place. Just as the particle of water in frost,\\ndefinitely and unalterably, takes the special form of the crystal of\\nsnow, so each new person that arrived at the springs was at once placed\\nin his special place.\\n\\n_Fürst_ Shtcherbatsky, _sammt Gemahlin und Tochter_, by the apartments\\nthey took, and from their name and from the friends they made, were\\nimmediately crystallized into a definite place marked out for them.\\n\\nThere was visiting the watering-place that year a real German Fürstin,\\nin consequence of which the crystallizing process went on more\\nvigorously than ever. Princess Shtcherbatskaya wished, above\\neverything, to present her daughter to this German princess, and the\\nday after their arrival she duly performed this rite. Kitty made a low\\nand graceful curtsey in the _very simple_, that is to say, very elegant\\nfrock that had been ordered her from Paris. The German princess said,\\n“I hope the roses will soon come back to this pretty little face,” and\\nfor the Shtcherbatskys certain definite lines of existence were at once\\nlaid down from which there was no departing. The Shtcherbatskys made\\nthe acquaintance too of the family of an English Lady Somebody, and of\\na German countess and her son, wounded in the last war, and of a\\nlearned Swede, and of M. Canut and his sister. But yet inevitably the\\nShtcherbatskys were thrown most into the society of a Moscow lady,\\nMarya Yevgenyevna Rtishtcheva and her daughter, whom Kitty disliked,\\nbecause she had fallen ill, like herself, over a love affair, and a\\nMoscow colonel, whom Kitty had known from childhood, and always seen in\\nuniform and epaulets, and who now, with his little eyes and his open\\nneck and flowered cravat, was uncommonly ridiculous and tedious,\\nbecause there was no getting rid of him. When all this was so firmly\\nestablished, Kitty began to be very much bored, especially as the\\nprince went away to Carlsbad and she was left alone with her mother.\\nShe took no interest in the people she knew, feeling that nothing fresh\\nwould come of them. Her chief mental interest in the watering-place\\nconsisted in watching and making theories about the people she did not\\nknow. It was characteristic of Kitty that she always imagined\\neverything in people in the most favorable light possible, especially\\nso in those she did not know. And now as she made surmises as to who\\npeople were, what were their relations to one another, and what they\\nwere like, Kitty endowed them with the most marvelous and noble\\ncharacters, and found confirmation of her idea in her observations.\\n\\nOf these people the one that attracted her most was a Russian girl who\\nhad come to the watering-place with an invalid Russian lady, Madame\\nStahl, as everyone called her. Madame Stahl belonged to the highest\\nsociety, but she was so ill that she could not walk, and only on\\nexceptionally fine days made her appearance at the springs in an\\ninvalid carriage. But it was not so much from ill-health as from\\npride—so Princess Shtcherbatskaya interpreted it—that Madame Stahl had\\nnot made the acquaintance of anyone among the Russians there. The\\nRussian girl looked after Madame Stahl, and besides that, she was, as\\nKitty observed, on friendly terms with all the invalids who were\\nseriously ill, and there were many of them at the springs, and looked\\nafter them in the most natural way. This Russian girl was not, as Kitty\\ngathered, related to Madame Stahl, nor was she a paid attendant. Madame\\nStahl called her Varenka, and other people called her “Mademoiselle\\nVarenka.” Apart from the interest Kitty took in this girl’s relations\\nwith Madame Stahl and with other unknown persons, Kitty, as often\\nhappened, felt an inexplicable attraction to Mademoiselle Varenka, and\\nwas aware when their eyes met that she too liked her.\\n\\nOf Mademoiselle Varenka one would not say that she had passed her first\\nyouth, but she was, as it were, a creature without youth; she might\\nhave been taken for nineteen or for thirty. If her features were\\ncriticized separately, she was handsome rather than plain, in spite of\\nthe sickly hue of her face. She would have been a good figure, too, if\\nit had not been for her extreme thinness and the size of her head,\\nwhich was too large for her medium height. But she was not likely to be\\nattractive to men. She was like a fine flower, already past its bloom\\nand without fragrance, though the petals were still unwithered.\\nMoreover, she would have been unattractive to men also from the lack of\\njust what Kitty had too much of—of the suppressed fire of vitality, and\\nthe consciousness of her own attractiveness.\\n\\nShe always seemed absorbed in work about which there could be no doubt,\\nand so it seemed she could not take interest in anything outside it. It\\nwas just this contrast with her own position that was for Kitty the\\ngreat attraction of Mademoiselle Varenka. Kitty felt that in her, in\\nher manner of life, she would find an example of what she was now so\\npainfully seeking: interest in life, a dignity in life—apart from the\\nworldly relations of girls with men, which so revolted Kitty, and\\nappeared to her now as a shameful hawking about of goods in search of a\\npurchaser. The more attentively Kitty watched her unknown friend, the\\nmore convinced she was this girl was the perfect creature she fancied\\nher, and the more eagerly she wished to make her acquaintance.\\n\\nThe two girls used to meet several times a day, and every time they\\nmet, Kitty’s eyes said: “Who are you? What are you? Are you really the\\nexquisite creature I imagine you to be? But for goodness’ sake don’t\\nsuppose,” her eyes added, “that I would force my acquaintance on you, I\\nsimply admire you and like you.” “I like you too, and you’re very, very\\nsweet. And I should like you better still, if I had time,” answered the\\neyes of the unknown girl. Kitty saw indeed, that she was always busy.\\nEither she was taking the children of a Russian family home from the\\nsprings, or fetching a shawl for a sick lady, and wrapping her up in\\nit, or trying to interest an irritable invalid, or selecting and buying\\ncakes for tea for someone.\\n\\nSoon after the arrival of the Shtcherbatskys there appeared in the\\nmorning crowd at the springs two persons who attracted universal and\\nunfavorable attention. These were a tall man with a stooping figure,\\nand huge hands, in an old coat too short for him, with black, simple,\\nand yet terrible eyes, and a pockmarked, kind-looking woman, very badly\\nand tastelessly dressed. Recognizing these persons as Russians, Kitty\\nhad already in her imagination begun constructing a delightful and\\ntouching romance about them. But the princess, having ascertained from\\nthe visitors’ list that this was Nikolay Levin and Marya Nikolaevna,\\nexplained to Kitty what a bad man this Levin was, and all her fancies\\nabout these two people vanished. Not so much from what her mother told\\nher, as from the fact that it was Konstantin’s brother, this pair\\nsuddenly seemed to Kitty intensely unpleasant. This Levin, with his\\ncontinual twitching of his head, aroused in her now an irrepressible\\nfeeling of disgust.\\n\\nIt seemed to her that his big, terrible eyes, which persistently\\npursued her, expressed a feeling of hatred and contempt, and she tried\\nto avoid meeting him 31\\n\\nIt was a wet day; it had been raining all the morning, and the\\ninvalids, with their parasols, had flocked into the arcades.\\n\\nKitty was walking there with her mother and the Moscow colonel, smart\\nand jaunty in his European coat, bought ready-made at Frankfort. They\\nwere walking on one side of the arcade, trying to avoid Levin, who was\\nwalking on the other side. Varenka, in her dark dress, in a black hat\\nwith a turn-down brim, was walking up and down the whole length of the\\narcade with a blind Frenchwoman, and, every time she met Kitty, they\\nexchanged friendly glances.\\n\\n“Mamma, couldn’t I speak to her?” said Kitty, watching her unknown\\nfriend, and noticing that she was going up to the spring, and that they\\nmight come there together.\\n\\n“Oh, if you want to so much, I’ll find out about her first and make her\\nacquaintance myself,” answered her mother. “What do you see in her out\\nof the way? A companion, she must be. If you like, I’ll make\\nacquaintance with Madame Stahl; I used to know her _belle-sœur_,” added\\nthe princess, lifting her head haughtily.\\n\\nKitty knew that the princess was offended that Madame Stahl had seemed\\nto avoid making her acquaintance. Kitty did not insist.\\n\\n“How wonderfully sweet she is!” she said, gazing at Varenka just as she\\nhanded a glass to the Frenchwoman. “Look how natural and sweet it all\\nis.”\\n\\n“It’s so funny to see your _engouements_,” said the princess. “No, we’d\\nbetter go back,” she added, noticing Levin coming towards them with his\\ncompanion and a German doctor, to whom he was talking very noisily and\\nangrily.\\n\\nThey turned to go back, when suddenly they heard, not noisy talk, but\\nshouting. Levin, stopping short, was shouting at the doctor, and the\\ndoctor, too, was excited. A crowd gathered about them. The princess and\\nKitty beat a hasty retreat, while the colonel joined the crowd to find\\nout what was the matter.\\n\\nA few minutes later the colonel overtook them.\\n\\n“What was it?” inquired the princess.\\n\\n“Scandalous and disgraceful!” answered the colonel. “The one thing to\\nbe dreaded is meeting Russians abroad. That tall gentleman was abusing\\nthe doctor, flinging all sorts of insults at him because he wasn’t\\ntreating him quite as he liked, and he began waving his stick at him.\\nIt’s simply a scandal!”\\n\\n“Oh, how unpleasant!” said the princess. “Well, and how did it end?”\\n\\n“Luckily at that point that ... the one in the mushroom hat ...\\nintervened. A Russian lady, I think she is,” said the colonel.\\n\\n“Mademoiselle Varenka?” asked Kitty.\\n\\n“Yes, yes. She came to the rescue before anyone; she took the man by\\nthe arm and led him away.”\\n\\n“There, mamma,” said Kitty; “you wonder that I’m enthusiastic about\\nher.”\\n\\nThe next day, as she watched her unknown friend, Kitty noticed that\\nMademoiselle Varenka was already on the same terms with Levin and his\\ncompanion as with her other _protégés_. She went up to them, entered\\ninto conversation with them, and served as interpreter for the woman,\\nwho could not speak any foreign language.\\n\\nKitty began to entreat her mother still more urgently to let her make\\nfriends with Varenka. And, disagreeable as it was to the princess to\\nseem to take the first step in wishing to make the acquaintance of\\nMadame Stahl, who thought fit to give herself airs, she made inquiries\\nabout Varenka, and, having ascertained particulars about her tending to\\nprove that there could be no harm though little good in the\\nacquaintance, she herself approached Varenka and made acquaintance with\\nher.\\n\\nChoosing a time when her daughter had gone to the spring, while Varenka\\nhad stopped outside the baker’s, the princess went up to her.\\n\\n“Allow me to make your acquaintance,” she said, with her dignified\\nsmile. “My daughter has lost her heart to you,” she said. “Possibly you\\ndo not know me. I am....”\\n\\n“That feeling is more than reciprocal, princess,” Varenka answered\\nhurriedly.\\n\\n“What a good deed you did yesterday to our poor compatriot!” said the\\nprincess.\\n\\nVarenka flushed a little. “I don’t remember. I don’t think I did\\nanything,” she said.\\n\\n“Why, you saved that Levin from disagreeable consequences.”\\n\\n“Yes, _sa compagne_ called me, and I tried to pacify him, he’s very\\nill, and was dissatisfied with the doctor. I’m used to looking after\\nsuch invalids.”\\n\\n“Yes, I’ve heard you live at Mentone with your aunt—I think—Madame\\nStahl: I used to know her _belle-sœur_.”\\n\\n“No, she’s not my aunt. I call her mamma, but I am not related to her;\\nI was brought up by her,” answered Varenka, flushing a little again.\\n\\nThis was so simply said, and so sweet was the truthful and candid\\nexpression of her face, that the princess saw why Kitty had taken such\\na fancy to Varenka.\\n\\n“Well, and what’s this Levin going to do?” asked the princess.\\n\\n“He’s going away,” answered Varenka.\\n\\nAt that instant Kitty came up from the spring beaming with delight that\\nher mother had become acquainted with her unknown friend.\\n\\n“Well, see, Kitty, your intense desire to make friends with\\nMademoiselle....”\\n\\n“Varenka,” Varenka put in smiling, “that’s what everyone calls me.”\\n\\nKitty blushed with pleasure, and slowly, without speaking, pressed her\\nnew friend’s hand, which did not respond to her pressure, but lay\\nmotionless in her hand. The hand did not respond to her pressure, but\\nthe face of Mademoiselle Varenka glowed with a soft, glad, though\\nrather mournful smile, that showed large but handsome teeth.\\n\\n“I have long wished for this too,” she said.\\n\\n“But you are so busy.”\\n\\n“Oh, no, I’m not at all busy,” answered Varenka, but at that moment she\\nhad to leave her new friends because two little Russian girls, children\\nof an invalid, ran up to her.\\n\\n“Varenka, mamma’s calling!” they cried.\\n\\nAnd Varenka went after them 32\\n\\nThe particulars which the princess had learned in regard to Varenka’s\\npast and her relations with Madame Stahl were as follows:\\n\\nMadame Stahl, of whom some people said that she had worried her husband\\nout of his life, while others said it was he who had made her wretched\\nby his immoral behavior, had always been a woman of weak health and\\nenthusiastic temperament. When, after her separation from her husband,\\nshe gave birth to her only child, the child had died almost\\nimmediately, and the family of Madame Stahl, knowing her sensibility,\\nand fearing the news would kill her, had substituted another child, a\\nbaby born the same night and in the same house in Petersburg, the\\ndaughter of the chief cook of the Imperial Household. This was Varenka.\\nMadame Stahl learned later on that Varenka was not her own child, but\\nshe went on bringing her up, especially as very soon afterwards Varenka\\nhad not a relation of her own living. Madame Stahl had now been living\\nmore than ten years continuously abroad, in the south, never leaving\\nher couch. And some people said that Madame Stahl had made her social\\nposition as a philanthropic, highly religious woman; other people said\\nshe really was at heart the highly ethical being, living for nothing\\nbut the good of her fellow creatures, which she represented herself to\\nbe. No one knew what her faith was—Catholic, Protestant, or Orthodox.\\nBut one fact was indubitable—she was in amicable relations with the\\nhighest dignitaries of all the churches and sects.\\n\\nVarenka lived with her all the while abroad, and everyone who knew\\nMadame Stahl knew and liked Mademoiselle Varenka, as everyone called\\nher.\\n\\nHaving learned all these facts, the princess found nothing to object to\\nin her daughter’s intimacy with Varenka, more especially as Varenka’s\\nbreeding and education were of the best—she spoke French and English\\nextremely well—and what was of the most weight, brought a message from\\nMadame Stahl expressing her regret that she was prevented by her ill\\nhealth from making the acquaintance of the princess.\\n\\nAfter getting to know Varenka, Kitty became more and more fascinated by\\nher friend, and every day she discovered new virtues in her.\\n\\nThe princess, hearing that Varenka had a good voice, asked her to come\\nand sing to them in the evening.\\n\\n“Kitty plays, and we have a piano; not a good one, it’s true, but you\\nwill give us so much pleasure,” said the princess with her affected\\nsmile, which Kitty disliked particularly just then, because she noticed\\nthat Varenka had no inclination to sing. Varenka came, however, in the\\nevening and brought a roll of music with her. The princess had invited\\nMarya Yevgenyevna and her daughter and the colonel.\\n\\nVarenka seemed quite unaffected by there being persons present she did\\nnot know, and she went directly to the piano. She could not accompany\\nherself, but she could sing music at sight very well. Kitty, who played\\nwell, accompanied her.\\n\\n“You have an extraordinary talent,” the princess said to her after\\nVarenka had sung the first song extremely well.\\n\\nMarya Yevgenyevna and her daughter expressed their thanks and\\nadmiration.\\n\\n“Look,” said the colonel, looking out of the window, “what an audience\\nhas collected to listen to you.” There actually was quite a\\nconsiderable crowd under the windows.\\n\\n“I am very glad it gives you pleasure,” Varenka answered simply.\\n\\nKitty looked with pride at her friend. She was enchanted by her talent,\\nand her voice, and her face, but most of all by her manner, by the way\\nVarenka obviously thought nothing of her singing and was quite unmoved\\nby their praises. She seemed only to be asking: “Am I to sing again, or\\nis that enough?”\\n\\n“If it had been I,” thought Kitty, “how proud I should have been! How\\ndelighted I should have been to see that crowd under the windows! But\\nshe’s utterly unmoved by it. Her only motive is to avoid refusing and\\nto please mamma. What is there in her? What is it gives her the power\\nto look down on everything, to be calm independently of everything? How\\nI should like to know it and to learn it of her!” thought Kitty, gazing\\ninto her serene face. The princess asked Varenka to sing again, and\\nVarenka sang another song, also smoothly, distinctly, and well,\\nstanding erect at the piano and beating time on it with her thin,\\ndark-skinned hand.\\n\\nThe next song in the book was an Italian one. Kitty played the opening\\nbars, and looked round at Varenka.\\n\\n“Let’s skip that,” said Varenka, flushing a little. Kitty let her eyes\\nrest on Varenka’s face, with a look of dismay and inquiry.\\n\\n“Very well, the next one,” she said hurriedly, turning over the pages,\\nand at once feeling that there was something connected with the song.\\n\\n“No,” answered Varenka with a smile, laying her hand on the music, “no,\\nlet’s have that one.” And she sang it just as quietly, as coolly, and\\nas well as the others.\\n\\nWhen she had finished, they all thanked her again, and went off to tea.\\nKitty and Varenka went out into the little garden that adjoined the\\nhouse.\\n\\n“Am I right, that you have some reminiscences connected with that\\nsong?” said Kitty. “Don’t tell me,” she added hastily, “only say if I’m\\nright.”\\n\\n“No, why not? I’ll tell you simply,” said Varenka, and, without waiting\\nfor a reply, she went on: “Yes, it brings up memories, once painful\\nones. I cared for someone once, and I used to sing him that song.”\\n\\nKitty with big, wide-open eyes gazed silently, sympathetically at\\nVarenka.\\n\\n“I cared for him, and he cared for me; but his mother did not wish it,\\nand he married another girl. He’s living now not far from us, and I see\\nhim sometimes. You didn’t think I had a love story too,” she said, and\\nthere was a faint gleam in her handsome face of that fire which Kitty\\nfelt must once have glowed all over her.\\n\\n“I didn’t think so? Why, if I were a man, I could never care for anyone\\nelse after knowing you. Only I can’t understand how he could, to please\\nhis mother, forget you and make you unhappy; he had no heart.”\\n\\n“Oh, no, he’s a very good man, and I’m not unhappy; quite the contrary,\\nI’m very happy. Well, so we shan’t be singing any more now,” she added,\\nturning towards the house.\\n\\n“How good you are! how good you are!” cried Kitty, and stopping her,\\nshe kissed her. “If I could only be even a little like you!”\\n\\n“Why should you be like anyone? You’re nice as you are,” said Varenka,\\nsmiling her gentle, weary smile.\\n\\n“No, I’m not nice at all. Come, tell me.... Stop a minute, let’s sit\\ndown,” said Kitty, making her sit down again beside her. “Tell me,\\nisn’t it humiliating to think that a man has disdained your love, that\\nhe hasn’t cared for it?...”\\n\\n“But he didn’t disdain it; I believe he cared for me, but he was a\\ndutiful son....”\\n\\n“Yes, but if it hadn’t been on account of his mother, if it had been\\nhis own doing?...” said Kitty, feeling she was giving away her secret,\\nand that her face, burning with the flush of shame, had betrayed her\\nalready.\\n\\n“In that case he would have done wrong, and I should not have regretted\\nhim,” answered Varenka, evidently realizing that they were now talking\\nnot of her, but of Kitty.\\n\\n“But the humiliation,” said Kitty, “the humiliation one can never\\nforget, can never forget,” she said, remembering her look at the last\\nball during the pause in the music.\\n\\n“Where is the humiliation? Why, you did nothing wrong?”\\n\\n“Worse than wrong—shameful.”\\n\\nVarenka shook her head and laid her hand on Kitty’s hand.\\n\\n“Why, what is there shameful?” she said. “You didn’t tell a man, who\\ndidn’t care for you, that you loved him, did you?”\\n\\n“Of course not; I never said a word, but he knew it. No, no, there are\\nlooks, there are ways; I can’t forget it, if I live a hundred years.”\\n\\n“Why so? I don’t understand. The whole point is whether you love him\\nnow or not,” said Varenka, who called everything by its name.\\n\\n“I hate him; I can’t forgive myself.”\\n\\n“Why, what for?”\\n\\n“The shame, the humiliation!”\\n\\n“Oh! if everyone were as sensitive as you are!” said Varenka. “There\\nisn’t a girl who hasn’t been through the same. And it’s all so\\nunimportant.”\\n\\n“Why, what is important?” said Kitty, looking into her face with\\ninquisitive wonder.\\n\\n“Oh, there’s so much that’s important,” said Varenka, smiling.\\n\\n“Why, what?”\\n\\n“Oh, so much that’s more important,” answered Varenka, not knowing what\\nto say. But at that instant they heard the princess’s voice from the\\nwindow. “Kitty, it’s cold! Either get a shawl, or come indoors.”\\n\\n“It really is time to go in!” said Varenka, getting up. “I have to go\\non to Madame Berthe’s; she asked me to.”\\n\\nKitty held her by the hand, and with passionate curiosity and entreaty\\nher eyes asked her: “What is it, what is this of such importance that\\ngives you such tranquillity? You know, tell me!” But Varenka did not\\neven know what Kitty’s eyes were asking her. She merely thought that\\nshe had to go to see Madame Berthe too that evening, and to make haste\\nhome in time for _maman’s_ tea at twelve o’clock. She went indoors,\\ncollected her music, and saying good-bye to everyone, was about to go.\\n\\n“Allow me to see you home,” said the colonel.\\n\\n“Yes, how can you go alone at night like this?” chimed in the princess.\\n“Anyway, I’ll send Parasha.”\\n\\nKitty saw that Varenka could hardly restrain a smile at the idea that\\nshe needed an escort.\\n\\n“No, I always go about alone and nothing ever happens to me,” she said,\\ntaking her hat. And kissing Kitty once more, without saying what was\\nimportant, she stepped out courageously with the music under her arm\\nand vanished into the twilight of the summer night, bearing away with\\nher her secret of what was important and what gave her the calm and\\ndignity so much to be envied 33\\n\\nKitty made the acquaintance of Madame Stahl too, and this acquaintance,\\ntogether with her friendship with Varenka, did not merely exercise a\\ngreat influence on her, it also comforted her in her mental distress.\\nShe found this comfort through a completely new world being opened to\\nher by means of this acquaintance, a world having nothing in common\\nwith her past, an exalted, noble world, from the height of which she\\ncould contemplate her past calmly. It was revealed to her that besides\\nthe instinctive life to which Kitty had given herself up hitherto there\\nwas a spiritual life. This life was disclosed in religion, but a\\nreligion having nothing in common with that one which Kitty had known\\nfrom childhood, and which found expression in litanies and all-night\\nservices at the Widow’s Home, where one might meet one’s friends, and\\nin learning by heart Slavonic texts with the priest. This was a lofty,\\nmysterious religion connected with a whole series of noble thoughts and\\nfeelings, which one could do more than merely believe because one was\\ntold to, which one could love.\\n\\nKitty found all this out not from words. Madame Stahl talked to Kitty\\nas to a charming child that one looks on with pleasure as on the memory\\nof one’s youth, and only once she said in passing that in all human\\nsorrows nothing gives comfort but love and faith, and that in the sight\\nof Christ’s compassion for us no sorrow is trifling—and immediately\\ntalked of other things. But in every gesture of Madame Stahl, in every\\nword, in every heavenly—as Kitty called it—look, and above all in the\\nwhole story of her life, which she heard from Varenka, Kitty recognized\\nthat something “that was important,” of which, till then, she had known\\nnothing.\\n\\nYet, elevated as Madame Stahl’s character was, touching as was her\\nstory, and exalted and moving as was her speech, Kitty could not help\\ndetecting in her some traits which perplexed her. She noticed that when\\nquestioning her about her family, Madame Stahl had smiled\\ncontemptuously, which was not in accord with Christian meekness. She\\nnoticed, too, that when she had found a Catholic priest with her,\\nMadame Stahl had studiously kept her face in the shadow of the\\nlamp-shade and had smiled in a peculiar way. Trivial as these two\\nobservations were, they perplexed her, and she had her doubts as to\\nMadame Stahl. But on the other hand Varenka, alone in the world,\\nwithout friends or relations, with a melancholy disappointment in the\\npast, desiring nothing, regretting nothing, was just that perfection of\\nwhich Kitty dared hardly dream. In Varenka she realized that one has\\nbut to forget oneself and love others, and one will be calm, happy, and\\nnoble. And that was what Kitty longed to be. Seeing now clearly what\\nwas _the most important_, Kitty was not satisfied with being\\nenthusiastic over it; she at once gave herself up with her whole soul\\nto the new life that was opening to her. From Varenka’s accounts of the\\ndoings of Madame Stahl and other people whom she mentioned, Kitty had\\nalready constructed the plan of her own future life. She would, like\\nMadame Stahl’s niece, Aline, of whom Varenka had talked to her a great\\ndeal, seek out those who were in trouble, wherever she might be living,\\nhelp them as far as she could, give them the Gospel, read the Gospel to\\nthe sick, to criminals, to the dying. The idea of reading the Gospel to\\ncriminals, as Aline did, particularly fascinated Kitty. But all these\\nwere secret dreams, of which Kitty did not talk either to her mother or\\nto Varenka.\\n\\nWhile awaiting the time for carrying out her plans on a large scale,\\nhowever, Kitty, even then at the springs, where there were so many\\npeople ill and unhappy, readily found a chance for practicing her new\\nprinciples in imitation of Varenka.\\n\\nAt first the princess noticed nothing but that Kitty was much under the\\ninfluence of her _engouement_, as she called it, for Madame Stahl, and\\nstill more for Varenka. She saw that Kitty did not merely imitate\\nVarenka in her conduct, but unconsciously imitated her in her manner of\\nwalking, of talking, of blinking her eyes. But later on the princess\\nnoticed that, apart from this adoration, some kind of serious spiritual\\nchange was taking place in her daughter.\\n\\nThe princess saw that in the evenings Kitty read a French testament\\nthat Madame Stahl had given her—a thing she had never done before; that\\nshe avoided society acquaintances and associated with the sick people\\nwho were under Varenka’s protection, and especially one poor family,\\nthat of a sick painter, Petrov. Kitty was unmistakably proud of playing\\nthe part of a sister of mercy in that family. All this was well enough,\\nand the princess had nothing to say against it, especially as Petrov’s\\nwife was a perfectly nice sort of woman, and that the German princess,\\nnoticing Kitty’s devotion, praised her, calling her an angel of\\nconsolation. All this would have been very well, if there had been no\\nexaggeration. But the princess saw that her daughter was rushing into\\nextremes, and so indeed she told her.\\n\\n“_Il ne faut jamais rien outrer_,” she said to her.\\n\\nHer daughter made her no reply, only in her heart she thought that one\\ncould not talk about exaggeration where Christianity was concerned.\\nWhat exaggeration could there be in the practice of a doctrine wherein\\none was bidden to turn the other cheek when one was smitten, and give\\none’s cloak if one’s coat were taken? But the princess disliked this\\nexaggeration, and disliked even more the fact that she felt her\\ndaughter did not care to show her all her heart. Kitty did in fact\\nconceal her new views and feelings from her mother. She concealed them\\nnot because she did not respect or did not love her mother, but simply\\nbecause she was her mother. She would have revealed them to anyone\\nsooner than to her mother.\\n\\n“How is it Anna Pavlovna’s not been to see us for so long?” the\\nprincess said one day of Madame Petrova. “I’ve asked her, but she seems\\nput out about something.”\\n\\n“No, I’ve not noticed it, maman,” said Kitty, flushing hotly.\\n\\n“Is it long since you went to see them?”\\n\\n“We’re meaning to make an expedition to the mountains tomorrow,”\\nanswered Kitty.\\n\\n“Well, you can go,” answered the princess, gazing at her daughter’s\\nembarrassed face and trying to guess the cause of her embarrassment.\\n\\nThat day Varenka came to dinner and told them that Anna Pavlovna had\\nchanged her mind and given up the expedition for the morrow. And the\\nprincess noticed again that Kitty reddened.\\n\\n“Kitty, haven’t you had some misunderstanding with the Petrovs?” said\\nthe princess, when they were left alone. “Why has she given up sending\\nthe children and coming to see us?”\\n\\nKitty answered that nothing had happened between them, and that she\\ncould not tell why Anna Pavlovna seemed displeased with her. Kitty\\nanswered perfectly truly. She did not know the reason Anna Pavlovna had\\nchanged to her, but she guessed it. She guessed at something which she\\ncould not tell her mother, which she did not put into words to herself.\\nIt was one of those things which one knows but which one can never\\nspeak of even to oneself, so terrible and shameful would it be to be\\nmistaken.\\n\\nAgain and again she went over in her memory all her relations with the\\nfamily. She remembered the simple delight expressed on the round,\\ngood-humored face of Anna Pavlovna at their meetings; she remembered\\ntheir secret confabulations about the invalid, their plots to draw him\\naway from the work which was forbidden him, and to get him\\nout-of-doors; the devotion of the youngest boy, who used to call her\\n“my Kitty,” and would not go to bed without her. How nice it all was!\\nThen she recalled the thin, terribly thin figure of Petrov, with his\\nlong neck, in his brown coat, his scant, curly hair, his questioning\\nblue eyes that were so terrible to Kitty at first, and his painful\\nattempts to seem hearty and lively in her presence. She recalled the\\nefforts she had made at first to overcome the repugnance she felt for\\nhim, as for all consumptive people, and the pains it had cost her to\\nthink of things to say to him. She recalled the timid, softened look\\nwith which he gazed at her, and the strange feeling of compassion and\\nawkwardness, and later of a sense of her own goodness, which she had\\nfelt at it. How nice it all was! But all that was at first. Now, a few\\ndays ago, everything was suddenly spoiled. Anna Pavlovna had met Kitty\\nwith affected cordiality, and had kept continual watch on her and on\\nher husband.\\n\\nCould that touching pleasure he showed when she came near be the cause\\nof Anna Pavlovna’s coolness?\\n\\n“Yes,” she mused, “there was something unnatural about Anna Pavlovna,\\nand utterly unlike her good nature, when she said angrily the day\\nbefore yesterday: ‘There, he will keep waiting for you; he wouldn’t\\ndrink his coffee without you, though he’s grown so dreadfully weak.’”\\n\\n“Yes, perhaps, too, she didn’t like it when I gave him the rug. It was\\nall so simple, but he took it so awkwardly, and was so long thanking\\nme, that I felt awkward too. And then that portrait of me he did so\\nwell. And most of all that look of confusion and tenderness! Yes, yes,\\nthat’s it!” Kitty repeated to herself with horror. “No, it can’t be, it\\noughtn’t to be! He’s so much to be pitied!” she said to herself\\ndirectly after.\\n\\nThis doubt poisoned the charm of her new life 34\\n\\nBefore the end of the course of drinking the waters, Prince\\nShtcherbatsky, who had gone on from Carlsbad to Baden and Kissingen to\\nRussian friends—to get a breath of Russian air, as he said—came back to\\nhis wife and daughter.\\n\\nThe views of the prince and of the princess on life abroad were\\ncompletely opposed. The princess thought everything delightful, and in\\nspite of her established position in Russian society, she tried abroad\\nto be like a European fashionable lady, which she was not—for the\\nsimple reason that she was a typical Russian gentlewoman; and so she\\nwas affected, which did not altogether suit her. The prince, on the\\ncontrary, thought everything foreign detestable, got sick of European\\nlife, kept to his Russian habits, and purposely tried to show himself\\nabroad less European than he was in reality.\\n\\nThe prince returned thinner, with the skin hanging in loose bags on his\\ncheeks, but in the most cheerful frame of mind. His good humor was even\\ngreater when he saw Kitty completely recovered. The news of Kitty’s\\nfriendship with Madame Stahl and Varenka, and the reports the princess\\ngave him of some kind of change she had noticed in Kitty, troubled the\\nprince and aroused his habitual feeling of jealousy of everything that\\ndrew his daughter away from him, and a dread that his daughter might\\nhave got out of the reach of his influence into regions inaccessible to\\nhim. But these unpleasant matters were all drowned in the sea of\\nkindliness and good humor which was always within him, and more so than\\never since his course of Carlsbad waters.\\n\\nThe day after his arrival the prince, in his long overcoat, with his\\nRussian wrinkles and baggy cheeks propped up by a starched collar, set\\noff with his daughter to the spring in the greatest good humor.\\n\\nIt was a lovely morning: the bright, cheerful houses with their little\\ngardens, the sight of the red-faced, red-armed, beer-drinking German\\nwaitresses, working away merrily, did the heart good. But the nearer\\nthey got to the springs the oftener they met sick people; and their\\nappearance seemed more pitiable than ever among the everyday conditions\\nof prosperous German life. Kitty was no longer struck by this contrast.\\nThe bright sun, the brilliant green of the foliage, the strains of the\\nmusic were for her the natural setting of all these familiar faces,\\nwith their changes to greater emaciation or to convalescence, for which\\nshe watched. But to the prince the brightness and gaiety of the June\\nmorning, and the sound of the orchestra playing a gay waltz then in\\nfashion, and above all, the appearance of the healthy attendants,\\nseemed something unseemly and monstrous, in conjunction with these\\nslowly moving, dying figures gathered together from all parts of\\nEurope. In spite of his feeling of pride and, as it were, of the return\\nof youth, with his favorite daughter on his arm, he felt awkward, and\\nalmost ashamed of his vigorous step and his sturdy, stout limbs. He\\nfelt almost like a man not dressed in a crowd.\\n\\n“Present me to your new friends,” he said to his daughter, squeezing\\nher hand with his elbow. “I like even your horrid Soden for making you\\nso well again. Only it’s melancholy, very melancholy here. Who’s that?”\\n\\nKitty mentioned the names of all the people they met, with some of whom\\nshe was acquainted and some not. At the entrance of the garden they met\\nthe blind lady, Madame Berthe, with her guide, and the prince was\\ndelighted to see the old Frenchwoman’s face light up when she heard\\nKitty’s voice. She at once began talking to him with French exaggerated\\npoliteness, applauding him for having such a delightful daughter,\\nextolling Kitty to the skies before her face, and calling her a\\ntreasure, a pearl, and a consoling angel.\\n\\n“Well, she’s the second angel, then,” said the prince, smiling. “she\\ncalls Mademoiselle Varenka angel number one.”\\n\\n“Oh! Mademoiselle Varenka, she’s a real angel, allez,” Madame Berthe\\nassented.\\n\\nIn the arcade they met Varenka herself. She was walking rapidly towards\\nthem carrying an elegant red bag.\\n\\n“Here is papa come,” Kitty said to her.\\n\\nVarenka made—simply and naturally as she did everything—a movement\\nbetween a bow and a curtsey, and immediately began talking to the\\nprince, without shyness, naturally, as she talked to everyone.\\n\\n“Of course I know you; I know you very well,” the prince said to her\\nwith a smile, in which Kitty detected with joy that her father liked\\nher friend. “Where are you off to in such haste?”\\n\\n“Maman’s here,” she said, turning to Kitty. “She has not slept all\\nnight, and the doctor advised her to go out. I’m taking her her work.”\\n\\n“So that’s angel number one?” said the prince when Varenka had gone on.\\n\\nKitty saw that her father had meant to make fun of Varenka, but that he\\ncould not do it because he liked her.\\n\\n“Come, so we shall see all your friends,” he went on, “even Madame\\nStahl, if she deigns to recognize me.”\\n\\n“Why, did you know her, papa?” Kitty asked apprehensively, catching the\\ngleam of irony that kindled in the prince’s eyes at the mention of\\nMadame Stahl.\\n\\n“I used to know her husband, and her too a little, before she’d joined\\nthe Pietists.”\\n\\n“What is a Pietist, papa?” asked Kitty, dismayed to find that what she\\nprized so highly in Madame Stahl had a name.\\n\\n“I don’t quite know myself. I only know that she thanks God for\\neverything, for every misfortune, and thanks God too that her husband\\ndied. And that’s rather droll, as they didn’t get on together.”\\n\\n“Who’s that? What a piteous face!” he asked, noticing a sick man of\\nmedium height sitting on a bench, wearing a brown overcoat and white\\ntrousers that fell in strange folds about his long, fleshless legs.\\nThis man lifted his straw hat, showed his scanty curly hair and high\\nforehead, painfully reddened by the pressure of the hat.\\n\\n“That’s Petrov, an artist,” answered Kitty, blushing. “And that’s his\\nwife,” she added, indicating Anna Pavlovna, who, as though on purpose,\\nat the very instant they approached walked away after a child that had\\nrun off along a path.\\n\\n“Poor fellow! and what a nice face he has!” said the prince. “Why don’t\\nyou go up to him? He wanted to speak to you.”\\n\\n“Well, let us go, then,” said Kitty, turning round resolutely. “How are\\nyou feeling today?” she asked Petrov.\\n\\nPetrov got up, leaning on his stick, and looked shyly at the prince.\\n\\n“This is my daughter,” said the prince. “Let me introduce myself.”\\n\\nThe painter bowed and smiled, showing his strangely dazzling white\\nteeth.\\n\\n“We expected you yesterday, princess,” he said to Kitty. He staggered\\nas he said this, and then repeated the motion, trying to make it seem\\nas if it had been intentional.\\n\\n“I meant to come, but Varenka said that Anna Pavlovna sent word you\\nwere not going.”\\n\\n“Not going!” said Petrov, blushing, and immediately beginning to cough,\\nand his eyes sought his wife. “Anita! Anita!” he said loudly, and the\\nswollen veins stood out like cords on his thin white neck.\\n\\nAnna Pavlovna came up.\\n\\n“So you sent word to the princess that we weren’t going!” he whispered\\nto her angrily, losing his voice.\\n\\n“Good morning, princess,” said Anna Pavlovna, with an assumed smile\\nutterly unlike her former manner. “Very glad to make your\\nacquaintance,” she said to the prince. “You’ve long been expected,\\nprince.”\\n\\n“What did you send word to the princess that we weren’t going for?” the\\nartist whispered hoarsely once more, still more angrily, obviously\\nexasperated that his voice failed him so that he could not give his\\nwords the expression he would have liked to.\\n\\n“Oh, mercy on us! I thought we weren’t going,” his wife answered\\ncrossly.\\n\\n“What, when....” He coughed and waved his hand. The prince took off his\\nhat and moved away with his daughter.\\n\\n“Ah! ah!” he sighed deeply. “Oh, poor things!”\\n\\n“Yes, papa,” answered Kitty. “And you must know they’ve three children,\\nno servant, and scarcely any means. He gets something from the\\nAcademy,” she went on briskly, trying to drown the distress that the\\nqueer change in Anna Pavlovna’s manner to her had aroused in her.\\n\\n“Oh, here’s Madame Stahl,” said Kitty, indicating an invalid carriage,\\nwhere, propped on pillows, something in gray and blue was lying under a\\nsunshade. This was Madame Stahl. Behind her stood the gloomy,\\nhealthy-looking German workman who pushed the carriage. Close by was\\nstanding a flaxen-headed Swedish count, whom Kitty knew by name.\\nSeveral invalids were lingering near the low carriage, staring at the\\nlady as though she were some curiosity.\\n\\nThe prince went up to her, and Kitty detected that disconcerting gleam\\nof irony in his eyes. He went up to Madame Stahl, and addressed her\\nwith extreme courtesy and affability in that excellent French that so\\nfew speak nowadays.\\n\\n“I don’t know if you remember me, but I must recall myself to thank you\\nfor your kindness to my daughter,” he said, taking off his hat and not\\nputting it on again.\\n\\n“Prince Alexander Shtcherbatsky,” said Madame Stahl, lifting upon him\\nher heavenly eyes, in which Kitty discerned a look of annoyance.\\n“Delighted! I have taken a great fancy to your daughter.”\\n\\n“You are still in weak health?”\\n\\n“Yes; I’m used to it,” said Madame Stahl, and she introduced the prince\\nto the Swedish count.\\n\\n“You are scarcely changed at all,” the prince said to her. “It’s ten or\\neleven years since I had the honor of seeing you.”\\n\\n“Yes; God sends the cross and sends the strength to bear it. Often one\\nwonders what is the goal of this life?... The other side!” she said\\nangrily to Varenka, who had rearranged the rug over her feet not to her\\nsatisfaction.\\n\\n“To do good, probably,” said the prince with a twinkle in his eye.\\n\\n“That is not for us to judge,” said Madame Stahl, perceiving the shade\\nof expression on the prince’s face. “So you will send me that book,\\ndear count? I’m very grateful to you,” she said to the young Swede.\\n\\n“Ah!” cried the prince, catching sight of the Moscow colonel standing\\nnear, and with a bow to Madame Stahl he walked away with his daughter\\nand the Moscow colonel, who joined them.\\n\\n“That’s our aristocracy, prince!” the Moscow colonel said with ironical\\nintention. He cherished a grudge against Madame Stahl for not making\\nhis acquaintance.\\n\\n“She’s just the same,” replied the prince.\\n\\n“Did you know her before her illness, prince—that’s to say before she\\ntook to her bed?”\\n\\n“Yes. She took to her bed before my eyes,” said the prince.\\n\\n“They say it’s ten years since she has stood on her feet.”\\n\\n“She doesn’t stand up because her legs are too short. She’s a very bad\\nfigure.”\\n\\n“Papa, it’s not possible!” cried Kitty.\\n\\n“That’s what wicked tongues say, my darling. And your Varenka catches\\nit too,” he added. “Oh, these invalid ladies!”\\n\\n“Oh, no, papa!” Kitty objected warmly. “Varenka worships her. And then\\nshe does so much good! Ask anyone! Everyone knows her and Aline Stahl.”\\n\\n“Perhaps so,” said the prince, squeezing her hand with his elbow; “but\\nit’s better when one does good so that you may ask everyone and no one\\nknows.”\\n\\nKitty did not answer, not because she had nothing to say, but because\\nshe did not care to reveal her secret thoughts even to her father. But,\\nstrange to say, although she had so made up her mind not to be\\ninfluenced by her father’s views, not to let him into her inmost\\nsanctuary, she felt that the heavenly image of Madame Stahl, which she\\nhad carried for a whole month in her heart, had vanished, never to\\nreturn, just as the fantastic figure made up of some clothes thrown\\ndown at random vanishes when one sees that it is only some garment\\nlying there. All that was left was a woman with short legs, who lay\\ndown because she had a bad figure, and worried patient Varenka for not\\narranging her rug to her liking. And by no effort of the imagination\\ncould Kitty bring back the former Madame Stahl 35\\n\\nThe prince communicated his good humor to his own family and his\\nfriends, and even to the German landlord in whose rooms the\\nShtcherbatskys were staying.\\n\\nOn coming back with Kitty from the springs, the prince, who had asked\\nthe colonel, and Marya Yevgenyevna, and Varenka all to come and have\\ncoffee with them, gave orders for a table and chairs to be taken into\\nthe garden under the chestnut tree, and lunch to be laid there. The\\nlandlord and the servants, too, grew brisker under the influence of his\\ngood spirits. They knew his open-handedness; and half an hour later the\\ninvalid doctor from Hamburg, who lived on the top floor, looked\\nenviously out of the window at the merry party of healthy Russians\\nassembled under the chestnut tree. In the trembling circles of shadow\\ncast by the leaves, at a table, covered with a white cloth, and set\\nwith coffeepot, bread-and-butter, cheese, and cold game, sat the\\nprincess in a high cap with lilac ribbons, distributing cups and\\nbread-and-butter. At the other end sat the prince, eating heartily, and\\ntalking loudly and merrily. The prince had spread out near him his\\npurchases, carved boxes, and knick-knacks, paper-knives of all sorts,\\nof which he bought a heap at every watering-place, and bestowed them\\nupon everyone, including Lieschen, the servant girl, and the landlord,\\nwith whom he jested in his comically bad German, assuring him that it\\nwas not the water had cured Kitty, but his splendid cookery, especially\\nhis plum soup. The princess laughed at her husband for his Russian\\nways, but she was more lively and good-humored than she had been all\\nthe while she had been at the waters. The colonel smiled, as he always\\ndid, at the prince’s jokes, but as far as regards Europe, of which he\\nbelieved himself to be making a careful study, he took the princess’s\\nside. The simple-hearted Marya Yevgenyevna simply roared with laughter\\nat everything absurd the prince said, and his jokes made Varenka\\nhelpless with feeble but infectious laughter, which was something Kitty\\nhad never seen before.\\n\\nKitty was glad of all this, but she could not be light-hearted. She\\ncould not solve the problem her father had unconsciously set her by his\\ngood-humored view of her friends, and of the life that had so attracted\\nher. To this doubt there was joined the change in her relations with\\nthe Petrovs, which had been so conspicuously and unpleasantly marked\\nthat morning. Everyone was good-humored, but Kitty could not feel\\ngood-humored, and this increased her distress. She felt a feeling such\\nas she had known in childhood, when she had been shut in her room as a\\npunishment, and had heard her sisters’ merry laughter outside.\\n\\n“Well, but what did you buy this mass of things for?” said the\\nprincess, smiling, and handing her husband a cup of coffee.\\n\\n“One goes for a walk, one looks in a shop, and they ask you to buy.\\n‘_Erlaucht, Durchlaucht?_’ Directly they say ‘_Durchlaucht_,’ I can’t\\nhold out. I lose ten thalers.”\\n\\n“It’s simply from boredom,” said the princess.\\n\\n“Of course it is. Such boredom, my dear, that one doesn’t know what to\\ndo with oneself.”\\n\\n“How can you be bored, prince? There’s so much that’s interesting now\\nin Germany,” said Marya Yevgenyevna.\\n\\n“But I know everything that’s interesting: the plum soup I know, and\\nthe pea sausages I know. I know everything.”\\n\\n“No, you may say what you like, prince, there’s the interest of their\\ninstitutions,” said the colonel.\\n\\n“But what is there interesting about it? They’re all as pleased as\\nbrass halfpence. They’ve conquered everybody, and why am I to be\\npleased at that? I haven’t conquered anyone; and I’m obliged to take\\noff my own boots, yes, and put them away too; in the morning, get up\\nand dress at once, and go to the dining-room to drink bad tea! How\\ndifferent it is at home! You get up in no haste, you get cross, grumble\\na little, and come round again. You’ve time to think things over, and\\nno hurry.”\\n\\n“But time’s money, you forget that,” said the colonel.\\n\\n“Time, indeed, that depends! Why, there’s time one would give a month\\nof for sixpence, and time you wouldn’t give half an hour of for any\\nmoney. Isn’t that so, Katinka? What is it? why are you so depressed?”\\n\\n“I’m not depressed.”\\n\\n“Where are you off to? Stay a little longer,” he said to Varenka.\\n\\n“I must be going home,” said Varenka, getting up, and again she went\\noff into a giggle. When she had recovered, she said good-bye, and went\\ninto the house to get her hat.\\n\\nKitty followed her. Even Varenka struck her as different. She was not\\nworse, but different from what she had fancied her before.\\n\\n“Oh, dear! it’s a long while since I’ve laughed so much!” said Varenka,\\ngathering up her parasol and her bag. “How nice he is, your father!”\\n\\nKitty did not speak.\\n\\n“When shall I see you again?” asked Varenka.\\n\\n“Mamma meant to go and see the Petrovs. Won’t you be there?” said\\nKitty, to try Varenka.\\n\\n“Yes,” answered Varenka. “They’re getting ready to go away, so I\\npromised to help them pack.”\\n\\n“Well, I’ll come too, then.”\\n\\n“No, why should you?”\\n\\n“Why not? why not? why not?” said Kitty, opening her eyes wide, and\\nclutching at Varenka’s parasol, so as not to let her go. “No, wait a\\nminute; why not?”\\n\\n“Oh, nothing; your father has come, and besides, they will feel awkward\\nat your helping.”\\n\\n“No, tell me why you don’t want me to be often at the Petrovs’. You\\ndon’t want me to—why not?”\\n\\n“I didn’t say that,” said Varenka quietly.\\n\\n“No, please tell me!”\\n\\n“Tell you everything?” asked Varenka.\\n\\n“Everything, everything!” Kitty assented.\\n\\n“Well, there’s really nothing of any consequence; only that Mihail\\nAlexeyevitch” (that was the artist’s name) “had meant to leave earlier,\\nand now he doesn’t want to go away,” said Varenka, smiling.\\n\\n“Well, well!” Kitty urged impatiently, looking darkly at Varenka.\\n\\n“Well, and for some reason Anna Pavlovna told him that he didn’t want\\nto go because you are here. Of course, that was nonsense; but there was\\na dispute over it—over you. You know how irritable these sick people\\nare.”\\n\\nKitty, scowling more than ever, kept silent, and Varenka went on\\nspeaking alone, trying to soften or soothe her, and seeing a storm\\ncoming—she did not know whether of tears or of words.\\n\\n“So you’d better not go.... You understand; you won’t be offended?...”\\n\\n“And it serves me right! And it serves me right!” Kitty cried quickly,\\nsnatching the parasol out of Varenka’s hand, and looking past her\\nfriend’s face.\\n\\nVarenka felt inclined to smile, looking at her childish fury, but she\\nwas afraid of wounding her.\\n\\n“How does it serve you right? I don’t understand,” she said.\\n\\n“It serves me right, because it was all sham; because it was all done\\non purpose, and not from the heart. What business had I to interfere\\nwith outsiders? And so it’s come about that I’m a cause of quarrel, and\\nthat I’ve done what nobody asked me to do. Because it was all a sham! a\\nsham! a sham!...”\\n\\n“A sham! with what object?” said Varenka gently.\\n\\n“Oh, it’s so idiotic! so hateful! There was no need whatever for me....\\nNothing but sham!” she said, opening and shutting the parasol.\\n\\n“But with what object?”\\n\\n“To seem better to people, to myself, to God; to deceive everyone. No!\\nnow I won’t descend to that. I’ll be bad; but anyway not a liar, a\\ncheat.”\\n\\n“But who is a cheat?” said Varenka reproachfully. “You speak as if....”\\n\\nBut Kitty was in one of her gusts of fury, and she would not let her\\nfinish.\\n\\n“I don’t talk about you, not about you at all. You’re perfection. Yes,\\nyes, I know you’re all perfection; but what am I to do if I’m bad? This\\nwould never have been if I weren’t bad. So let me be what I am. I won’t\\nbe a sham. What have I to do with Anna Pavlovna? Let them go their way,\\nand me go mine. I can’t be different.... And yet it’s not that, it’s\\nnot that.”\\n\\n“What is not that?” asked Varenka in bewilderment.\\n\\n“Everything. I can’t act except from the heart, and you act from\\nprinciple. I liked you simply, but you most likely only wanted to save\\nme, to improve me.”\\n\\n“You are unjust,” said Varenka.\\n\\n“But I’m not speaking of other people, I’m speaking of myself.”\\n\\n“Kitty,” they heard her mother’s voice, “come here, show papa your\\nnecklace.”\\n\\nKitty, with a haughty air, without making peace with her friend, took\\nthe necklace in a little box from the table and went to her mother.\\n\\n“What’s the matter? Why are you so red?” her mother and father said to\\nher with one voice.\\n\\n“Nothing,” she answered. “I’ll be back directly,” and she ran back.\\n\\n“She’s still here,” she thought. “What am I to say to her? Oh, dear!\\nwhat have I done, what have I said? Why was I rude to her? What am I to\\ndo? What am I to say to her?” thought Kitty, and she stopped in the\\ndoorway.\\n\\nVarenka in her hat and with the parasol in her hands was sitting at the\\ntable examining the spring which Kitty had broken. She lifted her head.\\n\\n“Varenka, forgive me, do forgive me,” whispered Kitty, going up to her.\\n“I don’t remember what I said. I....”\\n\\n“I really didn’t mean to hurt you,” said Varenka, smiling.\\n\\nPeace was made. But with her father’s coming all the world in which she\\nhad been living was transformed for Kitty. She did not give up\\neverything she had learned, but she became aware that she had deceived\\nherself in supposing she could be what she wanted to be. Her eyes were,\\nit seemed, opened; she felt all the difficulty of maintaining herself\\nwithout hypocrisy and self-conceit on the pinnacle to which she had\\nwished to mount. Moreover, she became aware of all the dreariness of\\nthe world of sorrow, of sick and dying people, in which she had been\\nliving. The efforts she had made to like it seemed to her intolerable,\\nand she felt a longing to get back quickly into the fresh air, to\\nRussia, to Ergushovo, where, as she knew from letters, her sister Dolly\\nhad already gone with her children.\\n\\nBut her affection for Varenka did not wane. As she said good-bye, Kitty\\nbegged her to come to them in Russia.\\n\\n“I’ll come when you get married,” said Varenka.\\n\\n“I shall never marry.”\\n\\n“Well, then, I shall never come.”\\n\\n“Well, then, I shall be married simply for that. Mind now, remember\\nyour promise,” said Kitty.\\n\\nThe doctor’s prediction was fulfilled. Kitty returned home to Russia\\ncured. She was not so gay and thoughtless as before, but she was\\nserene. Her Moscow troubles had become a memory to her.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPART THREE 1\\n\\n\\nSergey Ivanovitch Koznishev wanted a rest from mental work, and instead\\nof going abroad as he usually did, he came towards the end of May to\\nstay in the country with his brother. In his judgment the best sort of\\nlife was a country life. He had come now to enjoy such a life at his\\nbrother’s. Konstantin Levin was very glad to have him, especially as he\\ndid not expect his brother Nikolay that summer. But in spite of his\\naffection and respect for Sergey Ivanovitch, Konstantin Levin was\\nuncomfortable with his brother in the country. It made him\\nuncomfortable, and it positively annoyed him to see his brother’s\\nattitude to the country. To Konstantin Levin the country was the\\nbackground of life, that is of pleasures, endeavors, labor. To Sergey\\nIvanovitch the country meant on one hand rest from work, on the other a\\nvaluable antidote to the corrupt influences of town, which he took with\\nsatisfaction and a sense of its utility. To Konstantin Levin the\\ncountry was good first because it afforded a field for labor, of the\\nusefulness of which there could be no doubt. To Sergey Ivanovitch the\\ncountry was particularly good, because there it was possible and\\nfitting to do nothing. Moreover, Sergey Ivanovitch’s attitude to the\\npeasants rather piqued Konstantin. Sergey Ivanovitch used to say that\\nhe knew and liked the peasantry, and he often talked to the peasants,\\nwhich he knew how to do without affectation or condescension, and from\\nevery such conversation he would deduce general conclusions in favor of\\nthe peasantry and in confirmation of his knowing them. Konstantin Levin\\ndid not like such an attitude to the peasants. To Konstantin the\\npeasant was simply the chief partner in their common labor, and in\\nspite of all the respect and the love, almost like that of kinship, he\\nhad for the peasant—sucked in probably, as he said himself, with the\\nmilk of his peasant nurse—still as a fellow-worker with him, while\\nsometimes enthusiastic over the vigor, gentleness, and justice of these\\nmen, he was very often, when their common labors called for other\\nqualities, exasperated with the peasant for his carelessness, lack of\\nmethod, drunkenness, and lying. If he had been asked whether he liked\\nor didn’t like the peasants, Konstantin Levin would have been\\nabsolutely at a loss what to reply. He liked and did not like the\\npeasants, just as he liked and did not like men in general. Of course,\\nbeing a good-hearted man, he liked men rather than he disliked them,\\nand so too with the peasants. But like or dislike “the people” as\\nsomething apart he could not, not only because he lived with “the\\npeople,” and all his interests were bound up with theirs, but also\\nbecause he regarded himself as a part of “the people,” did not see any\\nspecial qualities or failings distinguishing himself and “the people,”\\nand could not contrast himself with them. Moreover, although he had\\nlived so long in the closest relations with the peasants, as farmer and\\narbitrator, and what was more, as adviser (the peasants trusted him,\\nand for thirty miles round they would come to ask his advice), he had\\nno definite views of “the people,” and would have been as much at a\\nloss to answer the question whether he knew “the people” as the\\nquestion whether he liked them. For him to say he knew the peasantry\\nwould have been the same as to say he knew men. He was continually\\nwatching and getting to know people of all sorts, and among them\\npeasants, whom he regarded as good and interesting people, and he was\\ncontinually observing new points in them, altering his former views of\\nthem and forming new ones. With Sergey Ivanovitch it was quite the\\ncontrary. Just as he liked and praised a country life in comparison\\nwith the life he did not like, so too he liked the peasantry in\\ncontradistinction to the class of men he did not like, and so too he\\nknew the peasantry as something distinct from and opposed to men\\ngenerally. In his methodical brain there were distinctly formulated\\ncertain aspects of peasant life, deduced partly from that life itself,\\nbut chiefly from contrast with other modes of life. He never changed\\nhis opinion of the peasantry and his sympathetic attitude towards them.\\n\\nIn the discussions that arose between the brothers on their views of\\nthe peasantry, Sergey Ivanovitch always got the better of his brother,\\nprecisely because Sergey Ivanovitch had definite ideas about the\\npeasant—his character, his qualities, and his tastes. Konstantin Levin\\nhad no definite and unalterable idea on the subject, and so in their\\narguments Konstantin was readily convicted of contradicting himself.\\n\\nIn Sergey Ivanovitch’s eyes his younger brother was a capital fellow,\\n_with his heart in the right place_ (as he expressed it in French), but\\nwith a mind which, though fairly quick, was too much influenced by the\\nimpressions of the moment, and consequently filled with contradictions.\\nWith all the condescension of an elder brother he sometimes explained\\nto him the true import of things, but he derived little satisfaction\\nfrom arguing with him because he got the better of him too easily.\\n\\nKonstantin Levin regarded his brother as a man of immense intellect and\\nculture, as generous in the highest sense of the word, and possessed of\\na special faculty for working for the public good. But in the depths of\\nhis heart, the older he became, and the more intimately he knew his\\nbrother, the more and more frequently the thought struck him that this\\nfaculty of working for the public good, of which he felt himself\\nutterly devoid, was possibly not so much a quality as a lack of\\nsomething—not a lack of good, honest, noble desires and tastes, but a\\nlack of vital force, of what is called heart, of that impulse which\\ndrives a man to choose someone out of the innumerable paths of life,\\nand to care only for that one. The better he knew his brother, the more\\nhe noticed that Sergey Ivanovitch, and many other people who worked for\\nthe public welfare, were not led by an impulse of the heart to care for\\nthe public good, but reasoned from intellectual considerations that it\\nwas a right thing to take interest in public affairs, and consequently\\ntook interest in them. Levin was confirmed in this generalization by\\nobserving that his brother did not take questions affecting the public\\nwelfare or the question of the immortality of the soul a bit more to\\nheart than he did chess problems, or the ingenious construction of a\\nnew machine.\\n\\nBesides this, Konstantin Levin was not at his ease with his brother,\\nbecause in summer in the country Levin was continually busy with work\\non the land, and the long summer day was not long enough for him to get\\nthrough all he had to do, while Sergey Ivanovitch was taking a holiday.\\nBut though he was taking a holiday now, that is to say, he was doing no\\nwriting, he was so used to intellectual activity that he liked to put\\ninto concise and eloquent shape the ideas that occurred to him, and\\nliked to have someone to listen to him. His most usual and natural\\nlistener was his brother. And so in spite of the friendliness and\\ndirectness of their relations, Konstantin felt an awkwardness in\\nleaving him alone. Sergey Ivanovitch liked to stretch himself on the\\ngrass in the sun, and to lie so, basking and chatting lazily.\\n\\n“You wouldn’t believe,” he would say to his brother, “what a pleasure\\nthis rural laziness is to me. Not an idea in one’s brain, as empty as a\\ndrum!”\\n\\nBut Konstantin Levin found it dull sitting and listening to him,\\nespecially when he knew that while he was away they would be carting\\ndung onto the fields not ploughed ready for it, and heaping it all up\\nanyhow; and would not screw the shares in the ploughs, but would let\\nthem come off and then say that the new ploughs were a silly invention,\\nand there was nothing like the old Andreevna plough, and so on.\\n\\n“Come, you’ve done enough trudging about in the heat,” Sergey\\nIvanovitch would say to him.\\n\\n“No, I must just run round to the counting-house for a minute,” Levin\\nwould answer, and he would run off to the fields 2\\n\\nEarly in June it happened that Agafea Mihalovna, the old nurse and\\nhousekeeper, in carrying to the cellar a jar of mushrooms she had just\\npickled, slipped, fell, and sprained her wrist. The district doctor, a\\ntalkative young medical student, who had just finished his studies,\\ncame to see her. He examined the wrist, said it was not broken, was\\ndelighted at a chance of talking to the celebrated Sergey Ivanovitch\\nKoznishev, and to show his advanced views of things told him all the\\nscandal of the district, complaining of the poor state into which the\\ndistrict council had fallen. Sergey Ivanovitch listened attentively,\\nasked him questions, and, roused by a new listener, he talked fluently,\\nuttered a few keen and weighty observations, respectfully appreciated\\nby the young doctor, and was soon in that eager frame of mind his\\nbrother knew so well, which always, with him, followed a brilliant and\\neager conversation. After the departure of the doctor, he wanted to go\\nwith a fishing rod to the river. Sergey Ivanovitch was fond of angling,\\nand was, it seemed, proud of being able to care for such a stupid\\noccupation.\\n\\nKonstantin Levin, whose presence was needed in the plough land and\\nmeadows, had come to take his brother in the trap.\\n\\nIt was that time of the year, the turning-point of summer, when the\\ncrops of the present year are a certainty, when one begins to think of\\nthe sowing for next year, and the mowing is at hand; when the rye is\\nall in ear, though its ears are still light, not yet full, and it waves\\nin gray-green billows in the wind; when the green oats, with tufts of\\nyellow grass scattered here and there among it, droop irregularly over\\nthe late-sown fields; when the early buckwheat is already out and\\nhiding the ground; when the fallow lands, trodden hard as stone by the\\ncattle, are half ploughed over, with paths left untouched by the\\nplough; when from the dry dung-heaps carted onto the fields there comes\\nat sunset a smell of manure mixed with meadow-sweet, and on the\\nlow-lying lands the riverside meadows are a thick sea of grass waiting\\nfor the mowing, with blackened heaps of the stalks of sorrel among it.\\n\\nIt was the time when there comes a brief pause in the toil of the\\nfields before the beginning of the labors of harvest—every year\\nrecurring, every year straining every nerve of the peasants. The crop\\nwas a splendid one, and bright, hot summer days had set in with short,\\ndewy nights.\\n\\nThe brothers had to drive through the woods to reach the meadows.\\nSergey Ivanovitch was all the while admiring the beauty of the woods,\\nwhich were a tangled mass of leaves, pointing out to his brother now an\\nold lime tree on the point of flowering, dark on the shady side, and\\nbrightly spotted with yellow stipules, now the young shoots of this\\nyear’s saplings brilliant with emerald. Konstantin Levin did not like\\ntalking and hearing about the beauty of nature. Words for him took away\\nthe beauty of what he saw. He assented to what his brother said, but he\\ncould not help beginning to think of other things. When they came out\\nof the woods, all his attention was engrossed by the view of the fallow\\nland on the upland, in parts yellow with grass, in parts trampled and\\ncheckered with furrows, in parts dotted with ridges of dung, and in\\nparts even ploughed. A string of carts was moving across it. Levin\\ncounted the carts, and was pleased that all that were wanted had been\\nbrought, and at the sight of the meadows his thoughts passed to the\\nmowing. He always felt something special moving him to the quick at the\\nhay-making. On reaching the meadow Levin stopped the horse.\\n\\nThe morning dew was still lying on the thick undergrowth of the grass,\\nand that he might not get his feet wet, Sergey Ivanovitch asked his\\nbrother to drive him in the trap up to the willow tree from which the\\ncarp was caught. Sorry as Konstantin Levin was to crush down his mowing\\ngrass, he drove him into the meadow. The high grass softly turned about\\nthe wheels and the horse’s legs, leaving its seeds clinging to the wet\\naxles and spokes of the wheels. His brother seated himself under a\\nbush, arranging his tackle, while Levin led the horse away, fastened\\nhim up, and walked into the vast gray-green sea of grass unstirred by\\nthe wind. The silky grass with its ripe seeds came almost to his waist\\nin the dampest spots.\\n\\nCrossing the meadow, Konstantin Levin came out onto the road, and met\\nan old man with a swollen eye, carrying a skep on his shoulder.\\n\\n“What? taken a stray swarm, Fomitch?” he asked.\\n\\n“No, indeed, Konstantin Dmitrich! All we can do to keep our own! This\\nis the second swarm that has flown away.... Luckily the lads caught\\nthem. They were ploughing your field. They unyoked the horses and\\ngalloped after them.”\\n\\n“Well, what do you say, Fomitch—start mowing or wait a bit?”\\n\\n“Eh, well. Our way’s to wait till St. Peter’s Day. But you always mow\\nsooner. Well, to be sure, please God, the hay’s good. There’ll be\\nplenty for the beasts.”\\n\\n“What do you think about the weather?”\\n\\n“That’s in God’s hands. Maybe it will be fine.”\\n\\nLevin went up to his brother.\\n\\nSergey Ivanovitch had caught nothing, but he was not bored, and seemed\\nin the most cheerful frame of mind. Levin saw that, stimulated by his\\nconversation with the doctor, he wanted to talk. Levin, on the other\\nhand, would have liked to get home as soon as possible to give orders\\nabout getting together the mowers for next day, and to set at rest his\\ndoubts about the mowing, which greatly absorbed him.\\n\\n“Well, let’s be going,” he said.\\n\\n“Why be in such a hurry? Let’s stay a little. But how wet you are! Even\\nthough one catches nothing, it’s nice. That’s the best thing about\\nevery part of sport, that one has to do with nature. How exquisite this\\nsteely water is!” said Sergey Ivanovitch. “These riverside banks always\\nremind me of the riddle—do you know it? ‘The grass says to the water:\\nwe quiver and we quiver.’”\\n\\n“I don’t know the riddle,” answered Levin wearily 3\\n\\n“Do you know, I’ve been thinking about you,” said Sergey Ivanovitch.\\n“It’s beyond everything what’s being done in the district, according to\\nwhat this doctor tells me. He’s a very intelligent fellow. And as I’ve\\ntold you before, I tell you again: it’s not right for you not to go to\\nthe meetings, and altogether to keep out of the district business. If\\ndecent people won’t go into it, of course it’s bound to go all wrong.\\nWe pay the money, and it all goes in salaries, and there are no\\nschools, nor district nurses, nor midwives, nor drugstores—nothing.”\\n\\n“Well, I did try, you know,” Levin said slowly and unwillingly. “I\\ncan’t! and so there’s no help for it.”\\n\\n“But why can’t you? I must own I can’t make it out. Indifference,\\nincapacity—I won’t admit; surely it’s not simply laziness?”\\n\\n“None of those things. I’ve tried, and I see I can do nothing,” said\\nLevin.\\n\\nHe had hardly grasped what his brother was saying. Looking towards the\\nplough land across the river, he made out something black, but he could\\nnot distinguish whether it was a horse or the bailiff on horseback.\\n\\n“Why is it you can do nothing? You made an attempt and didn’t succeed,\\nas you think, and you give in. How can you have so little\\nself-respect?”\\n\\n“Self-respect!” said Levin, stung to the quick by his brother’s words;\\n“I don’t understand. If they’d told me at college that other people\\nunderstood the integral calculus, and I didn’t, then pride would have\\ncome in. But in this case one wants first to be convinced that one has\\ncertain qualifications for this sort of business, and especially that\\nall this business is of great importance.”\\n\\n“What! do you mean to say it’s not of importance?” said Sergey\\nIvanovitch, stung to the quick too at his brother’s considering\\nanything of no importance that interested him, and still more at his\\nobviously paying little attention to what he was saying.\\n\\n“I don’t think it important; it does not take hold of me, I can’t help\\nit,” answered Levin, making out that what he saw was the bailiff, and\\nthat the bailiff seemed to be letting the peasants go off the ploughed\\nland. They were turning the plough over. “Can they have finished\\nploughing?” he wondered.\\n\\n“Come, really though,” said the elder brother, with a frown on his\\nhandsome, clever face, “there’s a limit to everything. It’s very well\\nto be original and genuine, and to dislike everything conventional—I\\nknow all about that; but really, what you’re saying either has no\\nmeaning, or it has a very wrong meaning. How can you think it a matter\\nof no importance whether the peasant, whom you love as you assert....”\\n\\n“I never did assert it,” thought Konstantin Levin.\\n\\n“...dies without help? The ignorant peasant-women starve the children,\\nand the people stagnate in darkness, and are helpless in the hands of\\nevery village clerk, while you have at your disposal a means of helping\\nthem, and don’t help them because to your mind it’s of no importance.”\\n\\nAnd Sergey Ivanovitch put before him the alternative: either you are so\\nundeveloped that you can’t see all that you can do, or you won’t\\nsacrifice your ease, your vanity, or whatever it is, to do it.\\n\\nKonstantin Levin felt that there was no course open to him but to\\nsubmit, or to confess to a lack of zeal for the public good. And this\\nmortified him and hurt his feelings.\\n\\n“It’s both,” he said resolutely: “I don’t see that it was possible....”\\n\\n“What! was it impossible, if the money were properly laid out, to\\nprovide medical aid?”\\n\\n“Impossible, as it seems to me.... For the three thousand square miles\\nof our district, what with our thaws, and the storms, and the work in\\nthe fields, I don’t see how it is possible to provide medical aid all\\nover. And besides, I don’t believe in medicine.”\\n\\n“Oh, well, that’s unfair ... I can quote to you thousands of\\ninstances.... But the schools, anyway.”\\n\\n“Why have schools?”\\n\\n“What do you mean? Can there be two opinions of the advantage of\\neducation? If it’s a good thing for you, it’s a good thing for\\neveryone.”\\n\\nKonstantin Levin felt himself morally pinned against a wall, and so he\\ngot hot, and unconsciously blurted out the chief cause of his\\nindifference to public business.\\n\\n“Perhaps it may all be very good; but why should I worry myself about\\nestablishing dispensaries which I shall never make use of, and schools\\nto which I shall never send my children, to which even the peasants\\ndon’t want to send their children, and to which I’ve no very firm faith\\nthat they ought to send them?” said he.\\n\\nSergey Ivanovitch was for a minute surprised at this unexpected view of\\nthe subject; but he promptly made a new plan of attack. He was silent\\nfor a little, drew out a hook, threw it in again, and turned to his\\nbrother smiling.\\n\\n“Come, now.... In the first place, the dispensary is needed. We\\nourselves sent for the district doctor for Agafea Mihalovna.”\\n\\n“Oh, well, but I fancy her wrist will never be straight again.”\\n\\n“That remains to be proved.... Next, the peasant who can read and write\\nis as a workman of more use and value to you.”\\n\\n“No, you can ask anyone you like,” Konstantin Levin answered with\\ndecision, “the man that can read and write is much inferior as a\\nworkman. And mending the highroads is an impossibility; and as soon as\\nthey put up bridges they’re stolen.”\\n\\n“Still, that’s not the point,” said Sergey Ivanovitch, frowning. He\\ndisliked contradiction, and still more, arguments that were continually\\nskipping from one thing to another, introducing new and disconnected\\npoints, so that there was no knowing to which to reply. “Do you admit\\nthat education is a benefit for the people?”\\n\\n“Yes, I admit it,” said Levin without thinking, and he was conscious\\nimmediately that he had said what he did not think. He felt that if he\\nadmitted that, it would be proved that he had been talking meaningless\\nrubbish. How it would be proved he could not tell, but he knew that\\nthis would inevitably be logically proved to him, and he awaited the\\nproofs.\\n\\nThe argument turned out to be far simpler than he had expected.\\n\\n“If you admit that it is a benefit,” said Sergey Ivanovitch, “then, as\\nan honest man, you cannot help caring about it and sympathizing with\\nthe movement, and so wishing to work for it.”\\n\\n“But I still do not admit this movement to be just,” said Konstantin\\nLevin, reddening a little.\\n\\n“What! But you said just now....”\\n\\n“That’s to say, I don’t admit it’s being either good or possible.”\\n\\n“That you can’t tell without making the trial.”\\n\\n“Well, supposing that’s so,” said Levin, though he did not suppose so\\nat all, “supposing that is so, still I don’t see, all the same, what\\nI’m to worry myself about it for.”\\n\\n“How so?”\\n\\n“No; since we are talking, explain it to me from the philosophical\\npoint of view,” said Levin.\\n\\n“I can’t see where philosophy comes in,” said Sergey Ivanovitch, in a\\ntone, Levin fancied, as though he did not admit his brother’s right to\\ntalk about philosophy. And that irritated Levin.\\n\\n“I’ll tell you, then,” he said with heat, “I imagine the mainspring of\\nall our actions is, after all, self-interest. Now in the local\\ninstitutions I, as a nobleman, see nothing that could conduce to my\\nprosperity, and the roads are not better and could not be better; my\\nhorses carry me well enough over bad ones. Doctors and dispensaries are\\nno use to me. An arbitrator of disputes is no use to me. I never appeal\\nto him, and never shall appeal to him. The schools are no good to me,\\nbut positively harmful, as I told you. For me the district institutions\\nsimply mean the liability to pay fourpence halfpenny for every three\\nacres, to drive into the town, sleep with bugs, and listen to all sorts\\nof idiocy and loathsomeness, and self-interest offers me no\\ninducement.”\\n\\n“Excuse me,” Sergey Ivanovitch interposed with a smile, “self-interest\\ndid not induce us to work for the emancipation of the serfs, but we did\\nwork for it.”\\n\\n“No!” Konstantin Levin broke in with still greater heat; “the\\nemancipation of the serfs was a different matter. There self-interest\\ndid come in. One longed to throw off that yoke that crushed us, all\\ndecent people among us. But to be a town councilor and discuss how many\\ndustmen are needed, and how chimneys shall be constructed in the town\\nin which I don’t live—to serve on a jury and try a peasant who’s stolen\\na flitch of bacon, and listen for six hours at a stretch to all sorts\\nof jabber from the counsel for the defense and the prosecution, and the\\npresident cross-examining my old half-witted Alioshka, ‘Do you admit,\\nprisoner in the dock, the fact of the removal of the bacon?’ ‘Eh?’”\\n\\nKonstantin Levin had warmed to his subject, and began mimicking the\\npresident and the half-witted Alioshka: it seemed to him that it was\\nall to the point.\\n\\nBut Sergey Ivanovitch shrugged his shoulders.\\n\\n“Well, what do you mean to say, then?”\\n\\n“I simply mean to say that those rights that touch me ... my interest,\\nI shall always defend to the best of my ability; that when they made\\nraids on us students, and the police read our letters, I was ready to\\ndefend those rights to the utmost, to defend my rights to education and\\nfreedom. I can understand compulsory military service, which affects my\\nchildren, my brothers, and myself, I am ready to deliberate on what\\nconcerns me; but deliberating on how to spend forty thousand roubles of\\ndistrict council money, or judging the half-witted Alioshka—I don’t\\nunderstand, and I can’t do it.”\\n\\nKonstantin Levin spoke as though the floodgates of his speech had burst\\nopen. Sergey Ivanovitch smiled.\\n\\n“But tomorrow it’ll be your turn to be tried; would it have suited your\\ntastes better to be tried in the old criminal tribunal?”\\n\\n“I’m not going to be tried. I shan’t murder anybody, and I’ve no need\\nof it. Well, I tell you what,” he went on, flying off again to a\\nsubject quite beside the point, “our district self-government and all\\nthe rest of it—it’s just like the birch branches we stick in the ground\\non Trinity Day, for instance, to look like a copse which has grown up\\nof itself in Europe, and I can’t gush over these birch branches and\\nbelieve in them.”\\n\\nSergey Ivanovitch merely shrugged his shoulders, as though to express\\nhis wonder how the birch branches had come into their argument at that\\npoint, though he did really understand at once what his brother meant.\\n\\n“Excuse me, but you know one really can’t argue in that way,” he\\nobserved.\\n\\nBut Konstantin Levin wanted to justify himself for the failing, of\\nwhich he was conscious, of lack of zeal for the public welfare, and he\\nwent on.\\n\\n“I imagine,” he said, “that no sort of activity is likely to be lasting\\nif it is not founded on self-interest, that’s a universal principle, a\\nphilosophical principle,” he said, repeating the word “philosophical”\\nwith determination, as though wishing to show that he had as much right\\nas anyone else to talk of philosophy.\\n\\nSergey Ivanovitch smiled. “He too has a philosophy of his own at the\\nservice of his natural tendencies,” he thought.\\n\\n“Come, you’d better let philosophy alone,” he said. “The chief problem\\nof the philosophy of all ages consists just in finding the\\nindispensable connection which exists between individual and social\\ninterests. But that’s not to the point; what is to the point is a\\ncorrection I must make in your comparison. The birches are not simply\\nstuck in, but some are sown and some are planted, and one must deal\\ncarefully with them. It’s only those peoples that have an intuitive\\nsense of what’s of importance and significance in their institutions,\\nand know how to value them, that have a future before them—it’s only\\nthose peoples that one can truly call historical.”\\n\\nAnd Sergey Ivanovitch carried the subject into the regions of\\nphilosophical history where Konstantin Levin could not follow him, and\\nshowed him all the incorrectness of his view.\\n\\n“As for your dislike of it, excuse my saying so, that’s simply our\\nRussian sloth and old serf-owner’s ways, and I’m convinced that in you\\nit’s a temporary error and will pass.”\\n\\nKonstantin was silent. He felt himself vanquished on all sides, but he\\nfelt at the same time that what he wanted to say was unintelligible to\\nhis brother. Only he could not make up his mind whether it was\\nunintelligible because he was not capable of expressing his meaning\\nclearly, or because his brother would not or could not understand him.\\nBut he did not pursue the speculation, and without replying, he fell to\\nmusing on a quite different and personal matter.\\n\\nSergey Ivanovitch wound up the last line, untied the horse, and they\\ndrove off 4\\n\\nThe personal matter that absorbed Levin during his conversation with\\nhis brother was this. Once in a previous year he had gone to look at\\nthe mowing, and being made very angry by the bailiff he had recourse to\\nhis favorite means for regaining his temper,—he took a scythe from a\\npeasant and began mowing.\\n\\nHe liked the work so much that he had several times tried his hand at\\nmowing since. He had cut the whole of the meadow in front of his house,\\nand this year ever since the early spring he had cherished a plan for\\nmowing for whole days together with the peasants. Ever since his\\nbrother’s arrival, he had been in doubt whether to mow or not. He was\\nloath to leave his brother alone all day long, and he was afraid his\\nbrother would laugh at him about it. But as he drove into the meadow,\\nand recalled the sensations of mowing, he came near deciding that he\\nwould go mowing. After the irritating discussion with his brother, he\\npondered over this intention again.\\n\\n“I must have physical exercise, or my temper’ll certainly be ruined,”\\nhe thought, and he determined he would go mowing, however awkward he\\nmight feel about it with his brother or the peasants.\\n\\nTowards evening Konstantin Levin went to his counting house, gave\\ndirections as to the work to be done, and sent about the village to\\nsummon the mowers for the morrow, to cut the hay in Kalinov meadow, the\\nlargest and best of his grass lands.\\n\\n“And send my scythe, please, to Tit, for him to set it, and bring it\\nround tomorrow. I shall maybe do some mowing myself too,” he said,\\ntrying not to be embarrassed.\\n\\nThe bailiff smiled and said: “Yes, sir.”\\n\\nAt tea the same evening Levin said to his brother:\\n\\n“I fancy the fine weather will last. Tomorrow I shall start mowing.”\\n\\n“I’m so fond of that form of field labor,” said Sergey Ivanovitch.\\n\\n“I’m awfully fond of it. I sometimes mow myself with the peasants, and\\ntomorrow I want to try mowing the whole day.”\\n\\nSergey Ivanovitch lifted his head, and looked with interest at his\\nbrother.\\n\\n“How do you mean? Just like one of the peasants, all day long?”\\n\\n“Yes, it’s very pleasant,” said Levin.\\n\\n“It’s splendid as exercise, only you’ll hardly be able to stand it,”\\nsaid Sergey Ivanovitch, without a shade of irony.\\n\\n“I’ve tried it. It’s hard work at first, but you get into it. I dare\\nsay I shall manage to keep it up....”\\n\\n“Really! what an idea! But tell me, how do the peasants look at it? I\\nsuppose they laugh in their sleeves at their master’s being such a\\nqueer fish?”\\n\\n“No, I don’t think so; but it’s so delightful, and at the same time\\nsuch hard work, that one has no time to think about it.”\\n\\n“But how will you do about dining with them? To send you a bottle of\\nLafitte and roast turkey out there would be a little awkward.”\\n\\n“No, I’ll simply come home at the time of their noonday rest.”\\n\\nNext morning Konstantin Levin got up earlier than usual, but he was\\ndetained giving directions on the farm, and when he reached the mowing\\ngrass the mowers were already at their second row.\\n\\nFrom the uplands he could get a view of the shaded cut part of the\\nmeadow below, with its grayish ridges of cut grass, and the black heaps\\nof coats, taken off by the mowers at the place from which they had\\nstarted cutting.\\n\\nGradually, as he rode towards the meadow, the peasants came into sight,\\nsome in coats, some in their shirts mowing, one behind another in a\\nlong string, swinging their scythes differently. He counted forty-two\\nof them.\\n\\nThey were mowing slowly over the uneven, low-lying parts of the meadow,\\nwhere there had been an old dam. Levin recognized some of his own men.\\nHere was old Yermil in a very long white smock, bending forward to\\nswing a scythe; there was a young fellow, Vaska, who had been a\\ncoachman of Levin’s, taking every row with a wide sweep. Here, too, was\\nTit, Levin’s preceptor in the art of mowing, a thin little peasant. He\\nwas in front of all, and cut his wide row without bending, as though\\nplaying with the scythe.\\n\\nLevin got off his mare, and fastening her up by the roadside went to\\nmeet Tit, who took a second scythe out of a bush and gave it to him.\\n\\n“It’s ready, sir; it’s like a razor, cuts of itself,” said Tit, taking\\noff his cap with a smile and giving him the scythe.\\n\\nLevin took the scythe, and began trying it. As they finished their\\nrows, the mowers, hot and good-humored, came out into the road one\\nafter another, and, laughing a little, greeted the master. They all\\nstared at him, but no one made any remark, till a tall old man, with a\\nwrinkled, beardless face, wearing a short sheepskin jacket, came out\\ninto the road and accosted him.\\n\\n“Look’ee now, master, once take hold of the rope there’s no letting it\\ngo!” he said, and Levin heard smothered laughter among the mowers.\\n\\n“I’ll try not to let it go,” he said, taking his stand behind Tit, and\\nwaiting for the time to begin.\\n\\n“Mind’ee,” repeated the old man.\\n\\nTit made room, and Levin started behind him. The grass was short close\\nto the road, and Levin, who had not done any mowing for a long while,\\nand was disconcerted by the eyes fastened upon him, cut badly for the\\nfirst moments, though he swung his scythe vigorously. Behind him he\\nheard voices:\\n\\n“It’s not set right; handle’s too high; see how he has to stoop to it,”\\nsaid one.\\n\\n“Press more on the heel,” said another.\\n\\n“Never mind, he’ll get on all right,” the old man resumed.\\n\\n“He’s made a start.... You swing it too wide, you’ll tire yourself\\nout.... The master, sure, does his best for himself! But see the grass\\nmissed out! For such work us fellows would catch it!”\\n\\nThe grass became softer, and Levin, listening without answering,\\nfollowed Tit, trying to do the best he could. They moved a hundred\\npaces. Tit kept moving on, without stopping, not showing the slightest\\nweariness, but Levin was already beginning to be afraid he would not be\\nable to keep it up: he was so tired.\\n\\nHe felt as he swung his scythe that he was at the very end of his\\nstrength, and was making up his mind to ask Tit to stop. But at that\\nvery moment Tit stopped of his own accord, and stooping down picked up\\nsome grass, rubbed his scythe, and began whetting it. Levin\\nstraightened himself, and drawing a deep breath looked round. Behind\\nhim came a peasant, and he too was evidently tired, for he stopped at\\nonce without waiting to mow up to Levin, and began whetting his scythe.\\nTit sharpened his scythe and Levin’s, and they went on. The next time\\nit was just the same. Tit moved on with sweep after sweep of his\\nscythe, not stopping nor showing signs of weariness. Levin followed\\nhim, trying not to get left behind, and he found it harder and harder:\\nthe moment came when he felt he had no strength left, but at that very\\nmoment Tit stopped and whetted the scythes.\\n\\nSo they mowed the first row. And this long row seemed particularly hard\\nwork to Levin; but when the end was reached and Tit, shouldering his\\nscythe, began with deliberate stride returning on the tracks left by\\nhis heels in the cut grass, and Levin walked back in the same way over\\nthe space he had cut, in spite of the sweat that ran in streams over\\nhis face and fell in drops down his nose, and drenched his back as\\nthough he had been soaked in water, he felt very happy. What delighted\\nhim particularly was that now he knew he would be able to hold out.\\n\\nHis pleasure was only disturbed by his row not being well cut. “I will\\nswing less with my arm and more with my whole body,” he thought,\\ncomparing Tit’s row, which looked as if it had been cut with a line,\\nwith his own unevenly and irregularly lying grass.\\n\\nThe first row, as Levin noticed, Tit had mowed specially quickly,\\nprobably wishing to put his master to the test, and the row happened to\\nbe a long one. The next rows were easier, but still Levin had to strain\\nevery nerve not to drop behind the peasants.\\n\\nHe thought of nothing, wished for nothing, but not to be left behind\\nthe peasants, and to do his work as well as possible. He heard nothing\\nbut the swish of scythes, and saw before him Tit’s upright figure\\nmowing away, the crescent-shaped curve of the cut grass, the grass and\\nflower heads slowly and rhythmically falling before the blade of his\\nscythe, and ahead of him the end of the row, where would come the rest.\\n\\nSuddenly, in the midst of his toil, without understanding what it was\\nor whence it came, he felt a pleasant sensation of chill on his hot,\\nmoist shoulders. He glanced at the sky in the interval for whetting the\\nscythes. A heavy, lowering storm cloud had blown up, and big raindrops\\nwere falling. Some of the peasants went to their coats and put them on;\\nothers—just like Levin himself—merely shrugged their shoulders,\\nenjoying the pleasant coolness of it.\\n\\nAnother row, and yet another row, followed—long rows and short rows,\\nwith good grass and with poor grass. Levin lost all sense of time, and\\ncould not have told whether it was late or early now. A change began to\\ncome over his work, which gave him immense satisfaction. In the midst\\nof his toil there were moments during which he forgot what he was\\ndoing, and it came all easy to him, and at those same moments his row\\nwas almost as smooth and well cut as Tit’s. But so soon as he\\nrecollected what he was doing, and began trying to do better, he was at\\nonce conscious of all the difficulty of his task, and the row was badly\\nmown.\\n\\nOn finishing yet another row he would have gone back to the top of the\\nmeadow again to begin the next, but Tit stopped, and going up to the\\nold man said something in a low voice to him. They both looked at the\\nsun. “What are they talking about, and why doesn’t he go back?” thought\\nLevin, not guessing that the peasants had been mowing no less than four\\nhours without stopping, and it was time for their lunch.\\n\\n“Lunch, sir,” said the old man.\\n\\n“Is it really time? That’s right; lunch, then.”\\n\\nLevin gave his scythe to Tit, and together with the peasants, who were\\ncrossing the long stretch of mown grass, slightly sprinkled with rain,\\nto get their bread from the heap of coats, he went towards his house.\\nOnly then he suddenly awoke to the fact that he had been wrong about\\nthe weather and the rain was drenching his hay.\\n\\n“The hay will be spoiled,” he said.\\n\\n“Not a bit of it, sir; mow in the rain, and you’ll rake in fine\\nweather!” said the old man.\\n\\nLevin untied his horse and rode home to his coffee. Sergey Ivanovitch\\nwas only just getting up. When he had drunk his coffee, Levin rode back\\nagain to the mowing before Sergey Ivanovitch had had time to dress and\\ncome down to the dining-room 5\\n\\nAfter lunch Levin was not in the same place in the string of mowers as\\nbefore, but stood between the old man who had accosted him jocosely,\\nand now invited him to be his neighbor, and a young peasant, who had\\nonly been married in the autumn, and who was mowing this summer for the\\nfirst time.\\n\\nThe old man, holding himself erect, moved in front, with his feet\\nturned out, taking long, regular strides, and with a precise and\\nregular action which seemed to cost him no more effort than swinging\\none’s arms in walking, as though it were in play, he laid down the\\nhigh, even row of grass. It was as though it were not he but the sharp\\nscythe of itself swishing through the juicy grass.\\n\\nBehind Levin came the lad Mishka. His pretty, boyish face, with a twist\\nof fresh grass bound round his hair, was all working with effort; but\\nwhenever anyone looked at him he smiled. He would clearly have died\\nsooner than own it was hard work for him.\\n\\nLevin kept between them. In the very heat of the day the mowing did not\\nseem such hard work to him. The perspiration with which he was drenched\\ncooled him, while the sun, that burned his back, his head, and his\\narms, bare to the elbow, gave a vigor and dogged energy to his labor;\\nand more and more often now came those moments of unconsciousness, when\\nit was possible not to think what one was doing. The scythe cut of\\nitself. These were happy moments. Still more delightful were the\\nmoments when they reached the stream where the rows ended, and the old\\nman rubbed his scythe with the wet, thick grass, rinsed its blade in\\nthe fresh water of the stream, ladled out a little in a tin dipper, and\\noffered Levin a drink.\\n\\n“What do you say to my home-brew, eh? Good, eh?” said he, winking.\\n\\nAnd truly Levin had never drunk any liquor so good as this warm water\\nwith green bits floating in it, and a taste of rust from the tin\\ndipper. And immediately after this came the delicious, slow saunter,\\nwith his hand on the scythe, during which he could wipe away the\\nstreaming sweat, take deep breaths of air, and look about at the long\\nstring of mowers and at what was happening around in the forest and the\\ncountry.\\n\\nThe longer Levin mowed, the oftener he felt the moments of\\nunconsciousness in which it seemed not his hands that swung the scythe,\\nbut the scythe mowing of itself, a body full of life and consciousness\\nof its own, and as though by magic, without thinking of it, the work\\nturned out regular and well-finished of itself. These were the most\\nblissful moments.\\n\\nIt was only hard work when he had to break off the motion, which had\\nbecome unconscious, and to think; when he had to mow round a hillock or\\na tuft of sorrel. The old man did this easily. When a hillock came he\\nchanged his action, and at one time with the heel, and at another with\\nthe tip of his scythe, clipped the hillock round both sides with short\\nstrokes. And while he did this he kept looking about and watching what\\ncame into his view: at one moment he picked a wild berry and ate it or\\noffered it to Levin, then he flung away a twig with the blade of the\\nscythe, then he looked at a quail’s nest, from which the bird flew just\\nunder the scythe, or caught a snake that crossed his path, and lifting\\nit on the scythe as though on a fork showed it to Levin and threw it\\naway.\\n\\nFor both Levin and the young peasant behind him, such changes of\\nposition were difficult. Both of them, repeating over and over again\\nthe same strained movement, were in a perfect frenzy of toil, and were\\nincapable of shifting their position and at the same time watching what\\nwas before them.\\n\\nLevin did not notice how time was passing. If he had been asked how\\nlong he had been working he would have said half an hour—and it was\\ngetting on for dinner time. As they were walking back over the cut\\ngrass, the old man called Levin’s attention to the little girls and\\nboys who were coming from different directions, hardly visible through\\nthe long grass, and along the road towards the mowers, carrying sacks\\nof bread dragging at their little hands and pitchers of the sour\\nrye-beer, with cloths wrapped round them.\\n\\n“Look’ee, the little emmets crawling!” he said, pointing to them, and\\nhe shaded his eyes with his hand to look at the sun. They mowed two\\nmore rows; the old man stopped.\\n\\n“Come, master, dinner time!” he said briskly. And on reaching the\\nstream the mowers moved off across the lines of cut grass towards their\\npile of coats, where the children who had brought their dinners were\\nsitting waiting for them. The peasants gathered into groups—those\\nfurther away under a cart, those nearer under a willow bush.\\n\\nLevin sat down by them; he felt disinclined to go away.\\n\\nAll constraint with the master had disappeared long ago. The peasants\\ngot ready for dinner. Some washed, the young lads bathed in the stream,\\nothers made a place comfortable for a rest, untied their sacks of\\nbread, and uncovered the pitchers of rye-beer. The old man crumbled up\\nsome bread in a cup, stirred it with the handle of a spoon, poured\\nwater on it from the dipper, broke up some more bread, and having\\nseasoned it with salt, he turned to the east to say his prayer.\\n\\n“Come, master, taste my sop,” said he, kneeling down before the cup.\\n\\nThe sop was so good that Levin gave up the idea of going home. He dined\\nwith the old man, and talked to him about his family affairs, taking\\nthe keenest interest in them, and told him about his own affairs and\\nall the circumstances that could be of interest to the old man. He felt\\nmuch nearer to him than to his brother, and could not help smiling at\\nthe affection he felt for this man. When the old man got up again, said\\nhis prayer, and lay down under a bush, putting some grass under his\\nhead for a pillow, Levin did the same, and in spite of the clinging\\nflies that were so persistent in the sunshine, and the midges that\\ntickled his hot face and body, he fell asleep at once and only waked\\nwhen the sun had passed to the other side of the bush and reached him.\\nThe old man had been awake a long while, and was sitting up whetting\\nthe scythes of the younger lads.\\n\\nLevin looked about him and hardly recognized the place, everything was\\nso changed. The immense stretch of meadow had been mown and was\\nsparkling with a peculiar fresh brilliance, with its lines of already\\nsweet-smelling grass in the slanting rays of the evening sun. And the\\nbushes about the river had been cut down, and the river itself, not\\nvisible before, now gleaming like steel in its bends, and the moving,\\nascending, peasants, and the sharp wall of grass of the unmown part of\\nthe meadow, and the hawks hovering over the stripped meadow—all was\\nperfectly new. Raising himself, Levin began considering how much had\\nbeen cut and how much more could still be done that day.\\n\\nThe work done was exceptionally much for forty-two men. They had cut\\nthe whole of the big meadow, which had, in the years of serf labor,\\ntaken thirty scythes two days to mow. Only the corners remained to do,\\nwhere the rows were short. But Levin felt a longing to get as much\\nmowing done that day as possible, and was vexed with the sun sinking so\\nquickly in the sky. He felt no weariness; all he wanted was to get his\\nwork done more and more quickly and as much done as possible.\\n\\n“Could you cut Mashkin Upland too?—what do you think?” he said to the\\nold man.\\n\\n“As God wills, the sun’s not high. A little vodka for the lads?”\\n\\nAt the afternoon rest, when they were sitting down again, and those who\\nsmoked had lighted their pipes, the old man told the men that “Mashkin\\nUpland’s to be cut—there’ll be some vodka.”\\n\\n“Why not cut it? Come on, Tit! We’ll look sharp! We can eat at night.\\nCome on!” cried voices, and eating up their bread, the mowers went back\\nto work.\\n\\n“Come, lads, keep it up!” said Tit, and ran on ahead almost at a trot.\\n\\n“Get along, get along!” said the old man, hurrying after him and easily\\novertaking him, “I’ll mow you down, look out!”\\n\\nAnd young and old mowed away, as though they were racing with one\\nanother. But however fast they worked, they did not spoil the grass,\\nand the rows were laid just as neatly and exactly. The little piece\\nleft uncut in the corner was mown in five minutes. The last of the\\nmowers were just ending their rows while the foremost snatched up their\\ncoats onto their shoulders, and crossed the road towards Mashkin\\nUpland.\\n\\nThe sun was already sinking into the trees when they went with their\\njingling dippers into the wooded ravine of Mashkin Upland. The grass\\nwas up to their waists in the middle of the hollow, soft, tender, and\\nfeathery, spotted here and there among the trees with wild\\nheart’s-ease.\\n\\nAfter a brief consultation—whether to take the rows lengthwise or\\ndiagonally—Prohor Yermilin, also a renowned mower, a huge, black-haired\\npeasant, went on ahead. He went up to the top, turned back again and\\nstarted mowing, and they all proceeded to form in line behind him,\\ngoing downhill through the hollow and uphill right up to the edge of\\nthe forest. The sun sank behind the forest. The dew was falling by now;\\nthe mowers were in the sun only on the hillside, but below, where a\\nmist was rising, and on the opposite side, they mowed into the fresh,\\ndewy shade. The work went rapidly. The grass cut with a juicy sound,\\nand was at once laid in high, fragrant rows. The mowers from all sides,\\nbrought closer together in the short row, kept urging one another on to\\nthe sound of jingling dippers and clanging scythes, and the hiss of the\\nwhetstones sharpening them, and good-humored shouts.\\n\\nLevin still kept between the young peasant and the old man. The old\\nman, who had put on his short sheepskin jacket, was just as\\ngood-humored, jocose, and free in his movements. Among the trees they\\nwere continually cutting with their scythes the so-called “birch\\nmushrooms,” swollen fat in the succulent grass. But the old man bent\\ndown every time he came across a mushroom, picked it up and put it in\\nhis bosom. “Another present for my old woman,” he said as he did so.\\n\\nEasy as it was to mow the wet, soft grass, it was hard work going up\\nand down the steep sides of the ravine. But this did not trouble the\\nold man. Swinging his scythe just as ever, and moving his feet in their\\nbig, plaited shoes with firm, little steps, he climbed slowly up the\\nsteep place, and though his breeches hanging out below his smock, and\\nhis whole frame trembled with effort, he did not miss one blade of\\ngrass or one mushroom on his way, and kept making jokes with the\\npeasants and Levin. Levin walked after him and often thought he must\\nfall, as he climbed with a scythe up a steep cliff where it would have\\nbeen hard work to clamber without anything. But he climbed up and did\\nwhat he had to do. He felt as though some external force were moving\\nhim 6\\n\\nMashkin Upland was mown, the last row finished, the peasants had put on\\ntheir coats and were gaily trudging home. Levin got on his horse and,\\nparting regretfully from the peasants, rode homewards. On the hillside\\nhe looked back; he could not see them in the mist that had risen from\\nthe valley; he could only hear rough, good-humored voices, laughter,\\nand the sound of clanking scythes.\\n\\nSergey Ivanovitch had long ago finished dinner, and was drinking iced\\nlemon and water in his own room, looking through the reviews and papers\\nwhich he had only just received by post, when Levin rushed into the\\nroom, talking merrily, with his wet and matted hair sticking to his\\nforehead, and his back and chest grimed and moist.\\n\\n“We mowed the whole meadow! Oh, it is nice, delicious! And how have you\\nbeen getting on?” said Levin, completely forgetting the disagreeable\\nconversation of the previous day.\\n\\n“Mercy! what do you look like!” said Sergey Ivanovitch, for the first\\nmoment looking round with some dissatisfaction. “And the door, do shut\\nthe door!” he cried. “You must have let in a dozen at least.”\\n\\nSergey Ivanovitch could not endure flies, and in his own room he never\\nopened the window except at night, and carefully kept the door shut.\\n\\n“Not one, on my honor. But if I have, I’ll catch them. You wouldn’t\\nbelieve what a pleasure it is! How have you spent the day?”\\n\\n“Very well. But have you really been mowing the whole day? I expect\\nyou’re as hungry as a wolf. Kouzma has got everything ready for you.”\\n\\n“No, I don’t feel hungry even. I had something to eat there. But I’ll\\ngo and wash.”\\n\\n“Yes, go along, go along, and I’ll come to you directly,” said Sergey\\nIvanovitch, shaking his head as he looked at his brother. “Go along,\\nmake haste,” he added smiling, and gathering up his books, he prepared\\nto go too. He, too, felt suddenly good-humored and disinclined to leave\\nhis brother’s side. “But what did you do while it was raining?”\\n\\n“Rain? Why, there was scarcely a drop. I’ll come directly. So you had a\\nnice day too? That’s first-rate.” And Levin went off to change his\\nclothes.\\n\\nFive minutes later the brothers met in the dining-room. Although it\\nseemed to Levin that he was not hungry, and he sat down to dinner\\nsimply so as not to hurt Kouzma’s feelings, yet when he began to eat\\nthe dinner struck him as extraordinarily good. Sergey Ivanovitch\\nwatched him with a smile.\\n\\n“Oh, by the way, there’s a letter for you,” said he. “Kouzma, bring it\\ndown, please. And mind you shut the doors.”\\n\\nThe letter was from Oblonsky. Levin read it aloud. Oblonsky wrote to\\nhim from Petersburg: “I have had a letter from Dolly; she’s at\\nErgushovo, and everything seems going wrong there. Do ride over and see\\nher, please; help her with advice; you know all about it. She will be\\nso glad to see you. She’s quite alone, poor thing. My mother-in-law and\\nall of them are still abroad.”\\n\\n“That’s capital! I will certainly ride over to her,” said Levin. “Or\\nwe’ll go together. She’s such a splendid woman, isn’t she?”\\n\\n“They’re not far from here, then?”\\n\\n“Twenty-five miles. Or perhaps it is thirty. But a capital road.\\nCapital, we’ll drive over.”\\n\\n“I shall be delighted,” said Sergey Ivanovitch, still smiling. The\\nsight of his younger brother’s appearance had immediately put him in a\\ngood humor.\\n\\n“Well, you have an appetite!” he said, looking at his dark-red,\\nsunburnt face and neck bent over the plate.\\n\\n“Splendid! You can’t imagine what an effectual remedy it is for every\\nsort of foolishness. I want to enrich medicine with a new word:\\n_Arbeitskur_.”\\n\\n“Well, but you don’t need it, I should fancy.”\\n\\n“No, but for all sorts of nervous invalids.”\\n\\n“Yes, it ought to be tried. I had meant to come to the mowing to look\\nat you, but it was so unbearably hot that I got no further than the\\nforest. I sat there a little, and went on by the forest to the village,\\nmet your old nurse, and sounded her as to the peasants’ view of you. As\\nfar as I can make out, they don’t approve of this. She said: ‘It’s not\\na gentleman’s work.’ Altogether, I fancy that in the people’s ideas\\nthere are very clear and definite notions of certain, as they call it,\\n‘gentlemanly’ lines of action. And they don’t sanction the gentry’s\\nmoving outside bounds clearly laid down in their ideas.”\\n\\n“Maybe so; but anyway it’s a pleasure such as I have never known in my\\nlife. And there’s no harm in it, you know. Is there?” answered Levin.\\n“I can’t help it if they don’t like it. Though I do believe it’s all\\nright. Eh?”\\n\\n“Altogether,” pursued Sergey Ivanovitch, “you’re satisfied with your\\nday?”\\n\\n“Quite satisfied. We cut the whole meadow. And such a splendid old man\\nI made friends with there! You can’t fancy how delightful he was!”\\n\\n“Well, so you’re content with your day. And so am I. First, I solved\\ntwo chess problems, and one a very pretty one—a pawn opening. I’ll show\\nit you. And then—I thought over our conversation yesterday.”\\n\\n“Eh! our conversation yesterday?” said Levin, blissfully dropping his\\neyelids and drawing deep breaths after finishing his dinner, and\\nabsolutely incapable of recalling what their conversation yesterday was\\nabout.\\n\\n“I think you are partly right. Our difference of opinion amounts to\\nthis, that you make the mainspring self-interest, while I suppose that\\ninterest in the common weal is bound to exist in every man of a certain\\ndegree of advancement. Possibly you are right too, that action founded\\non material interest would be more desirable. You are altogether, as\\nthe French say, too _primesautière_ a nature; you must have intense,\\nenergetic action, or nothing.”\\n\\nLevin listened to his brother and did not understand a single word, and\\ndid not want to understand. He was only afraid his brother might ask\\nhim some question which would make it evident he had not heard.\\n\\n“So that’s what I think it is, my dear boy,” said Sergey Ivanovitch,\\ntouching him on the shoulder.\\n\\n“Yes, of course. But, do you know? I won’t stand up for my view,”\\nanswered Levin, with a guilty, childlike smile. “Whatever was it I was\\ndisputing about?” he wondered. “Of course, I’m right, and he’s right,\\nand it’s all first-rate. Only I must go round to the counting house and\\nsee to things.” He got up, stretching and smiling. Sergey Ivanovitch\\nsmiled too.\\n\\n“If you want to go out, let’s go together,” he said, disinclined to be\\nparted from his brother, who seemed positively breathing out freshness\\nand energy. “Come, we’ll go to the counting house, if you have to go\\nthere.”\\n\\n“Oh, heavens!” shouted Levin, so loudly that Sergey Ivanovitch was\\nquite frightened.\\n\\n“What, what is the matter?”\\n\\n“How’s Agafea Mihalovna’s hand?” said Levin, slapping himself on the\\nhead. “I’d positively forgotten her even.”\\n\\n“It’s much better.”\\n\\n“Well, anyway I’ll run down to her. Before you’ve time to get your hat\\non, I’ll be back.”\\n\\nAnd he ran downstairs, clattering with his heels like a spring-rattle 7\\n\\nStephan Arkadyevitch had gone to Petersburg to perform the most natural\\nand essential official duty—so familiar to everyone in the government\\nservice, though incomprehensible to outsiders—that duty, but for which\\none could hardly be in government service, of reminding the ministry of\\nhis existence—and having, for the due performance of this rite, taken\\nall the available cash from home, was gaily and agreeably spending his\\ndays at the races and in the summer villas. Meanwhile Dolly and the\\nchildren had moved into the country, to cut down expenses as much as\\npossible. She had gone to Ergushovo, the estate that had been her\\ndowry, and the one where in spring the forest had been sold. It was\\nnearly forty miles from Levin’s Pokrovskoe. The big, old house at\\nErgushovo had been pulled down long ago, and the old prince had had the\\nlodge done up and built on to. Twenty years before, when Dolly was a\\nchild, the lodge had been roomy and comfortable, though, like all\\nlodges, it stood sideways to the entrance avenue, and faced the south.\\nBut by now this lodge was old and dilapidated. When Stepan Arkadyevitch\\nhad gone down in the spring to sell the forest, Dolly had begged him to\\nlook over the house and order what repairs might be needed. Stepan\\nArkadyevitch, like all unfaithful husbands indeed, was very solicitous\\nfor his wife’s comfort, and he had himself looked over the house, and\\ngiven instructions about everything that he considered necessary. What\\nhe considered necessary was to cover all the furniture with cretonne,\\nto put up curtains, to weed the garden, to make a little bridge on the\\npond, and to plant flowers. But he forgot many other essential matters,\\nthe want of which greatly distressed Darya Alexandrovna later on.\\n\\nIn spite of Stepan Arkadyevitch’s efforts to be an attentive father and\\nhusband, he never could keep in his mind that he had a wife and\\nchildren. He had bachelor tastes, and it was in accordance with them\\nthat he shaped his life. On his return to Moscow he informed his wife\\nwith pride that everything was ready, that the house would be a little\\nparadise, and that he advised her most certainly to go. His wife’s\\nstaying away in the country was very agreeable to Stepan Arkadyevitch\\nfrom every point of view: it did the children good, it decreased\\nexpenses, and it left him more at liberty. Darya Alexandrovna regarded\\nstaying in the country for the summer as essential for the children,\\nespecially for the little girl, who had not succeeded in regaining her\\nstrength after the scarlatina, and also as a means of escaping the\\npetty humiliations, the little bills owing to the wood-merchant, the\\nfishmonger, the shoemaker, which made her miserable. Besides this, she\\nwas pleased to go away to the country because she was dreaming of\\ngetting her sister Kitty to stay with her there. Kitty was to be back\\nfrom abroad in the middle of the summer, and bathing had been\\nprescribed for her. Kitty wrote that no prospect was so alluring as to\\nspend the summer with Dolly at Ergushovo, full of childish associations\\nfor both of them.\\n\\nThe first days of her existence in the country were very hard for\\nDolly. She used to stay in the country as a child, and the impression\\nshe had retained of it was that the country was a refuge from all the\\nunpleasantness of the town, that life there, though not luxurious—Dolly\\ncould easily make up her mind to that—was cheap and comfortable; that\\nthere was plenty of everything, everything was cheap, everything could\\nbe got, and children were happy. But now coming to the country as the\\nhead of a family, she perceived that it was all utterly unlike what she\\nhad fancied.\\n\\nThe day after their arrival there was a heavy fall of rain, and in the\\nnight the water came through in the corridor and in the nursery, so\\nthat the beds had to be carried into the drawing-room. There was no\\nkitchen maid to be found; of the nine cows, it appeared from the words\\nof the cowherd-woman that some were about to calve, others had just\\ncalved, others were old, and others again hard-uddered; there was not\\nbutter nor milk enough even for the children. There were no eggs. They\\ncould get no fowls; old, purplish, stringy cocks were all they had for\\nroasting and boiling. Impossible to get women to scrub the floors—all\\nwere potato-hoeing. Driving was out of the question, because one of the\\nhorses was restive, and bolted in the shafts. There was no place where\\nthey could bathe; the whole of the river-bank was trampled by the\\ncattle and open to the road; even walks were impossible, for the cattle\\nstrayed into the garden through a gap in the hedge, and there was one\\nterrible bull, who bellowed, and therefore might be expected to gore\\nsomebody. There were no proper cupboards for their clothes; what\\ncupboards there were either would not close at all, or burst open\\nwhenever anyone passed by them. There were no pots and pans; there was\\nno copper in the washhouse, nor even an ironing-board in the maids’\\nroom.\\n\\nFinding instead of peace and rest all these, from her point of view,\\nfearful calamities, Darya Alexandrovna was at first in despair. She\\nexerted herself to the utmost, felt the hopelessness of the position,\\nand was every instant suppressing the tears that started into her eyes.\\nThe bailiff, a retired quartermaster, whom Stepan Arkadyevitch had\\ntaken a fancy to and had appointed bailiff on account of his handsome\\nand respectful appearance as a hall-porter, showed no sympathy for\\nDarya Alexandrovna’s woes. He said respectfully, “nothing can be done,\\nthe peasants are such a wretched lot,” and did nothing to help her.\\n\\nThe position seemed hopeless. But in the Oblonskys’ household, as in\\nall families indeed, there was one inconspicuous but most valuable and\\nuseful person, Marya Philimonovna. She soothed her mistress, assured\\nher that everything would _come round_ (it was her expression, and\\nMatvey had borrowed it from her), and without fuss or hurry proceeded\\nto set to work herself. She had immediately made friends with the\\nbailiff’s wife, and on the very first day she drank tea with her and\\nthe bailiff under the acacias, and reviewed all the circumstances of\\nthe position. Very soon Marya Philimonovna had established her club, so\\nto say, under the acacias, and there it was, in this club, consisting\\nof the bailiff’s wife, the village elder, and the counting-house clerk,\\nthat the difficulties of existence were gradually smoothed away, and in\\na week’s time everything actually had come round. The roof was mended,\\na kitchen maid was found—a crony of the village elder’s—hens were\\nbought, the cows began giving milk, the garden hedge was stopped up\\nwith stakes, the carpenter made a mangle, hooks were put in the\\ncupboards, and they ceased to burst open spontaneously, and an\\nironing-board covered with army cloth was placed across from the arm of\\na chair to the chest of drawers, and there was a smell of flatirons in\\nthe maids’ room.\\n\\n“Just see, now, and you were quite in despair,” said Marya\\nPhilimonovna, pointing to the ironing-board. They even rigged up a\\nbathing-shed of straw hurdles. Lily began to bathe, and Darya\\nAlexandrovna began to realize, if only in part, her expectations, if\\nnot of a peaceful, at least of a comfortable, life in the country.\\nPeaceful with six children Darya Alexandrovna could not be. One would\\nfall ill, another might easily become so, a third would be without\\nsomething necessary, a fourth would show symptoms of a bad disposition,\\nand so on. Rare indeed were the brief periods of peace. But these cares\\nand anxieties were for Darya Alexandrovna the sole happiness possible.\\nHad it not been for them, she would have been left alone to brood over\\nher husband who did not love her. And besides, hard though it was for\\nthe mother to bear the dread of illness, the illnesses themselves, and\\nthe grief of seeing signs of evil propensities in her children—the\\nchildren themselves were even now repaying her in small joys for her\\nsufferings. Those joys were so small that they passed unnoticed, like\\ngold in sand, and at bad moments she could see nothing but the pain,\\nnothing but sand; but there were good moments too when she saw nothing\\nbut the joy, nothing but gold.\\n\\nNow in the solitude of the country, she began to be more and more\\nfrequently aware of those joys. Often, looking at them, she would make\\nevery possible effort to persuade herself that she was mistaken, that\\nshe as a mother was partial to her children. All the same, she could\\nnot help saying to herself that she had charming children, all six of\\nthem in different ways, but a set of children such as is not often to\\nbe met with, and she was happy in them, and proud of them 8\\n\\nTowards the end of May, when everything had been more or less\\nsatisfactorily arranged, she received her husband’s answer to her\\ncomplaints of the disorganized state of things in the country. He wrote\\nbegging her forgiveness for not having thought of everything before,\\nand promised to come down at the first chance. This chance did not\\npresent itself, and till the beginning of June Darya Alexandrovna\\nstayed alone in the country.\\n\\nOn the Sunday in St. Peter’s week Darya Alexandrovna drove to mass for\\nall her children to take the sacrament. Darya Alexandrovna in her\\nintimate, philosophical talks with her sister, her mother, and her\\nfriends very often astonished them by the freedom of her views in\\nregard to religion. She had a strange religion of transmigration of\\nsouls all her own, in which she had firm faith, troubling herself\\nlittle about the dogmas of the Church. But in her family she was strict\\nin carrying out all that was required by the Church—and not merely in\\norder to set an example, but with all her heart in it. The fact that\\nthe children had not been at the sacrament for nearly a year worried\\nher extremely, and with the full approval and sympathy of Marya\\nPhilimonovna she decided that this should take place now in the summer.\\n\\nFor several days before, Darya Alexandrovna was busily deliberating on\\nhow to dress all the children. Frocks were made or altered and washed,\\nseams and flounces were let out, buttons were sewn on, and ribbons got\\nready. One dress, Tanya’s, which the English governess had undertaken,\\ncost Darya Alexandrovna much loss of temper. The English governess in\\naltering it had made the seams in the wrong place, had taken up the\\nsleeves too much, and altogether spoilt the dress. It was so narrow on\\nTanya’s shoulders that it was quite painful to look at her. But Marya\\nPhilimonovna had the happy thought of putting in gussets, and adding a\\nlittle shoulder-cape. The dress was set right, but there was nearly a\\nquarrel with the English governess. On the morning, however, all was\\nhappily arranged, and towards ten o’clock—the time at which they had\\nasked the priest to wait for them for the mass—the children in their\\nnew dresses, with beaming faces, stood on the step before the carriage\\nwaiting for their mother.\\n\\nTo the carriage, instead of the restive Raven, they had harnessed,\\nthanks to the representations of Marya Philimonovna, the bailiff’s\\nhorse, Brownie, and Darya Alexandrovna, delayed by anxiety over her own\\nattire, came out and got in, dressed in a white muslin gown.\\n\\nDarya Alexandrovna had done her hair, and dressed with care and\\nexcitement. In the old days she had dressed for her own sake to look\\npretty and be admired. Later on, as she got older, dress became more\\nand more distasteful to her. She saw that she was losing her good\\nlooks. But now she began to feel pleasure and interest in dress again.\\nNow she did not dress for her own sake, not for the sake of her own\\nbeauty, but simply that as the mother of those exquisite creatures she\\nmight not spoil the general effect. And looking at herself for the last\\ntime in the looking-glass she was satisfied with herself. She looked\\nnice. Not nice as she would have wished to look nice in old days at a\\nball, but nice for the object which she now had in view.\\n\\nIn the church there was no one but the peasants, the servants and their\\nwomen-folk. But Darya Alexandrovna saw, or fancied she saw, the\\nsensation produced by her children and her. The children were not only\\nbeautiful to look at in their smart little dresses, but they were\\ncharming in the way they behaved. Aliosha, it is true, did not stand\\nquite correctly; he kept turning round, trying to look at his little\\njacket from behind; but all the same he was wonderfully sweet. Tanya\\nbehaved like a grown-up person, and looked after the little ones. And\\nthe smallest, Lily, was bewitching in her naïve astonishment at\\neverything, and it was difficult not to smile when, after taking the\\nsacrament, she said in English, “Please, some more.”\\n\\nOn the way home the children felt that something solemn had happened,\\nand were very sedate.\\n\\nEverything went happily at home too; but at lunch Grisha began\\nwhistling, and, what was worse, was disobedient to the English\\ngoverness, and was forbidden to have any tart. Darya Alexandrovna would\\nnot have let things go so far on such a day had she been present; but\\nshe had to support the English governess’s authority, and she upheld\\nher decision that Grisha should have no tart. This rather spoiled the\\ngeneral good humor. Grisha cried, declaring that Nikolinka had whistled\\ntoo, and he was not punished, and that he wasn’t crying for the tart—he\\ndidn’t care—but at being unjustly treated. This was really too tragic,\\nand Darya Alexandrovna made up her mind to persuade the English\\ngoverness to forgive Grisha, and she went to speak to her. But on the\\nway, as she passed the drawing-room, she beheld a scene, filling her\\nheart with such pleasure that the tears came into her eyes, and she\\nforgave the delinquent herself.\\n\\nThe culprit was sitting at the window in the corner of the\\ndrawing-room; beside him was standing Tanya with a plate. On the\\npretext of wanting to give some dinner to her dolls, she had asked the\\ngoverness’s permission to take her share of tart to the nursery, and\\nhad taken it instead to her brother. While still weeping over the\\ninjustice of his punishment, he was eating the tart, and kept saying\\nthrough his sobs, “Eat yourself; let’s eat it together ... together.”\\n\\nTanya had at first been under the influence of her pity for Grisha,\\nthen of a sense of her noble action, and tears were standing in her\\neyes too; but she did not refuse, and ate her share.\\n\\nOn catching sight of their mother they were dismayed, but, looking into\\nher face, they saw they were not doing wrong. They burst out laughing,\\nand, with their mouths full of tart, they began wiping their smiling\\nlips with their hands, and smearing their radiant faces all over with\\ntears and jam.\\n\\n“Mercy! Your new white frock! Tanya! Grisha!” said their mother, trying\\nto save the frock, but with tears in her eyes, smiling a blissful,\\nrapturous smile.\\n\\nThe new frocks were taken off, and orders were given for the little\\ngirls to have their blouses put on, and the boys their old jackets, and\\nthe wagonette to be harnessed; with Brownie, to the bailiff’s\\nannoyance, again in the shafts, to drive out for mushroom picking and\\nbathing. A roar of delighted shrieks arose in the nursery, and never\\nceased till they had set off for the bathing-place.\\n\\nThey gathered a whole basketful of mushrooms; even Lily found a birch\\nmushroom. It had always happened before that Miss Hoole found them and\\npointed them out to her; but this time she found a big one quite of\\nherself, and there was a general scream of delight, “Lily has found a\\nmushroom!”\\n\\nThen they reached the river, put the horses under the birch trees, and\\nwent to the bathing-place. The coachman, Terenty, fastened the horses,\\nwho kept whisking away the flies, to a tree, and, treading down the\\ngrass, lay down in the shade of a birch and smoked his shag, while the\\nnever-ceasing shrieks of delight of the children floated across to him\\nfrom the bathing-place.\\n\\nThough it was hard work to look after all the children and restrain\\ntheir wild pranks, though it was difficult too to keep in one’s head\\nand not mix up all the stockings, little breeches, and shoes for the\\ndifferent legs, and to undo and to do up again all the tapes and\\nbuttons, Darya Alexandrovna, who had always liked bathing herself, and\\nbelieved it to be very good for the children, enjoyed nothing so much\\nas bathing with all the children. To go over all those fat little legs,\\npulling on their stockings, to take in her arms and dip those little\\nnaked bodies, and to hear their screams of delight and alarm, to see\\nthe breathless faces with wide-open, scared, and happy eyes of all her\\nsplashing cherubs, was a great pleasure to her.\\n\\nWhen half the children had been dressed, some peasant women in holiday\\ndress, out picking herbs, came up to the bathing-shed and stopped\\nshyly. Marya Philimonovna called one of them and handed her a sheet and\\na shirt that had dropped into the water for her to dry them, and Darya\\nAlexandrovna began to talk to the women. At first they laughed behind\\ntheir hands and did not understand her questions, but soon they grew\\nbolder and began to talk, winning Darya Alexandrovna’s heart at once by\\nthe genuine admiration of the children that they showed.\\n\\n“My, what a beauty! as white as sugar,” said one, admiring Tanitchka,\\nand shaking her head; “but thin....”\\n\\n“Yes, she has been ill.”\\n\\n“And so they’ve been bathing you too,” said another to the baby.\\n\\n“No; he’s only three months old,” answered Darya Alexandrovna with\\npride.\\n\\n“You don’t say so!”\\n\\n“And have you any children?”\\n\\n“I’ve had four; I’ve two living—a boy and a girl. I weaned her last\\ncarnival.”\\n\\n“How old is she?”\\n\\n“Why, two years old.”\\n\\n“Why did you nurse her so long?”\\n\\n“It’s our custom; for three fasts....”\\n\\nAnd the conversation became most interesting to Darya Alexandrovna.\\nWhat sort of time did she have? What was the matter with the boy? Where\\nwas her husband? Did it often happen?\\n\\nDarya Alexandrovna felt disinclined to leave the peasant women, so\\ninteresting to her was their conversation, so completely identical were\\nall their interests. What pleased her most of all was that she saw\\nclearly what all the women admired more than anything was her having so\\nmany children, and such fine ones. The peasant women even made Darya\\nAlexandrovna laugh, and offended the English governess, because she was\\nthe cause of the laughter she did not understand. One of the younger\\nwomen kept staring at the Englishwoman, who was dressing after all the\\nrest, and when she put on her third petticoat she could not refrain\\nfrom the remark, “My, she keeps putting on and putting on, and she’ll\\nnever have done!” she said, and they all went off into roars 9\\n\\nOn the drive home, as Darya Alexandrovna, with all her children round\\nher, their heads still wet from their bath, and a kerchief tied over\\nher own head, was getting near the house, the coachman said, “There’s\\nsome gentleman coming: the master of Pokrovskoe, I do believe.”\\n\\nDarya Alexandrovna peeped out in front, and was delighted when she\\nrecognized in the gray hat and gray coat the familiar figure of Levin\\nwalking to meet them. She was glad to see him at any time, but at this\\nmoment she was specially glad he should see her in all her glory. No\\none was better able to appreciate her grandeur than Levin.\\n\\nSeeing her, he found himself face to face with one of the pictures of\\nhis daydream of family life.\\n\\n“You’re like a hen with your chickens, Darya Alexandrovna.”\\n\\n“Ah, how glad I am to see you!” she said, holding out her hand to him.\\n\\n“Glad to see me, but you didn’t let me know. My brother’s staying with\\nme. I got a note from Stiva that you were here.”\\n\\n“From Stiva?” Darya Alexandrovna asked with surprise.\\n\\n“Yes; he writes that you are here, and that he thinks you might allow\\nme to be of use to you,” said Levin, and as he said it he became\\nsuddenly embarrassed, and, stopping abruptly, he walked on in silence\\nby the wagonette, snapping off the buds of the lime trees and nibbling\\nthem. He was embarrassed through a sense that Darya Alexandrovna would\\nbe annoyed by receiving from an outsider help that should by rights\\nhave come from her own husband. Darya Alexandrovna certainly did not\\nlike this little way of Stepan Arkadyevitch’s of foisting his domestic\\nduties on others. And she was at once aware that Levin was aware of\\nthis. It was just for this fineness of perception, for this delicacy,\\nthat Darya Alexandrovna liked Levin.\\n\\n“I know, of course,” said Levin, “that that simply means that you would\\nlike to see me, and I’m exceedingly glad. Though I can fancy that, used\\nto town housekeeping as you are, you must feel in the wilds here, and\\nif there’s anything wanted, I’m altogether at your disposal.”\\n\\n“Oh, no!” said Dolly. “At first things were rather uncomfortable, but\\nnow we’ve settled everything capitally—thanks to my old nurse,” she\\nsaid, indicating Marya Philimonovna, who, seeing that they were\\nspeaking of her, smiled brightly and cordially to Levin. She knew him,\\nand knew that he would be a good match for her young lady, and was very\\nkeen to see the matter settled.\\n\\n“Won’t you get in, sir, we’ll make room this side!” she said to him.\\n\\n“No, I’ll walk. Children, who’d like to race the horses with me?” The\\nchildren knew Levin very little, and could not remember when they had\\nseen him, but they experienced in regard to him none of that strange\\nfeeling of shyness and hostility which children so often experience\\ntowards hypocritical, grown-up people, and for which they are so often\\nand miserably punished. Hypocrisy in anything whatever may deceive the\\ncleverest and most penetrating man, but the least wide-awake of\\nchildren recognizes it, and is revolted by it, however ingeniously it\\nmay be disguised. Whatever faults Levin had, there was not a trace of\\nhypocrisy in him, and so the children showed him the same friendliness\\nthat they saw in their mother’s face. On his invitation, the two elder\\nones at once jumped out to him and ran with him as simply as they would\\nhave done with their nurse or Miss Hoole or their mother. Lily, too,\\nbegan begging to go to him, and her mother handed her to him; he sat\\nher on his shoulder and ran along with her.\\n\\n“Don’t be afraid, don’t be afraid, Darya Alexandrovna!” he said,\\nsmiling good-humoredly to the mother; “there’s no chance of my hurting\\nor dropping her.”\\n\\nAnd, looking at his strong, agile, assiduously careful and needlessly\\nwary movements, the mother felt her mind at rest, and smiled gaily and\\napprovingly as she watched him.\\n\\nHere, in the country, with children, and with Darya Alexandrovna, with\\nwhom he was in sympathy, Levin was in a mood not infrequent with him,\\nof childlike light-heartedness that she particularly liked in him. As\\nhe ran with the children, he taught them gymnastic feats, set Miss\\nHoole laughing with his queer English accent, and talked to Darya\\nAlexandrovna of his pursuits in the country.\\n\\nAfter dinner, Darya Alexandrovna, sitting alone with him on the\\nbalcony, began to speak of Kitty.\\n\\n“You know, Kitty’s coming here, and is going to spend the summer with\\nme.”\\n\\n“Really,” he said, flushing, and at once, to change the conversation,\\nhe said: “Then I’ll send you two cows, shall I? If you insist on a bill\\nyou shall pay me five roubles a month; but it’s really too bad of you.”\\n\\n“No, thank you. We can manage very well now.”\\n\\n“Oh, well, then, I’ll have a look at your cows, and if you’ll allow me,\\nI’ll give directions about their food. Everything depends on their\\nfood.”\\n\\nAnd Levin, to turn the conversation, explained to Darya Alexandrovna\\nthe theory of cow-keeping, based on the principle that the cow is\\nsimply a machine for the transformation of food into milk, and so on.\\n\\nHe talked of this, and passionately longed to hear more of Kitty, and,\\nat the same time, was afraid of hearing it. He dreaded the breaking up\\nof the inward peace he had gained with such effort.\\n\\n“Yes, but still all this has to be looked after, and who is there to\\nlook after it?” Darya Alexandrovna responded, without interest.\\n\\nShe had by now got her household matters so satisfactorily arranged,\\nthanks to Marya Philimonovna, that she was disinclined to make any\\nchange in them; besides, she had no faith in Levin’s knowledge of\\nfarming. General principles, as to the cow being a machine for the\\nproduction of milk, she looked on with suspicion. It seemed to her that\\nsuch principles could only be a hindrance in farm management. It all\\nseemed to her a far simpler matter: all that was needed, as Marya\\nPhilimonovna had explained, was to give Brindle and Whitebreast more\\nfood and drink, and not to let the cook carry all the kitchen slops to\\nthe laundry maid’s cow. That was clear. But general propositions as to\\nfeeding on meal and on grass were doubtful and obscure. And, what was\\nmost important, she wanted to talk about Kitty 10\\n\\n“Kitty writes to me that there’s nothing she longs for so much as quiet\\nand solitude,” Dolly said after the silence that had followed.\\n\\n“And how is she—better?” Levin asked in agitation.\\n\\n“Thank God, she’s quite well again. I never believed her lungs were\\naffected.”\\n\\n“Oh, I’m very glad!” said Levin, and Dolly fancied she saw something\\ntouching, helpless, in his face as he said this and looked silently\\ninto her face.\\n\\n“Let me ask you, Konstantin Dmitrievitch,” said Darya Alexandrovna,\\nsmiling her kindly and rather mocking smile, “why is it you are angry\\nwith Kitty?”\\n\\n“I? I’m not angry with her,” said Levin.\\n\\n“Yes, you are angry. Why was it you did not come to see us nor them\\nwhen you were in Moscow?”\\n\\n“Darya Alexandrovna,” he said, blushing up to the roots of his hair, “I\\nwonder really that with your kind heart you don’t feel this. How it is\\nyou feel no pity for me, if nothing else, when you know....”\\n\\n“What do I know?”\\n\\n“You know I made an offer and that I was refused,” said Levin, and all\\nthe tenderness he had been feeling for Kitty a minute before was\\nreplaced by a feeling of anger for the slight he had suffered.\\n\\n“What makes you suppose I know?”\\n\\n“Because everybody knows it....”\\n\\n“That’s just where you are mistaken; I did not know it, though I had\\nguessed it was so.”\\n\\n“Well, now you know it.”\\n\\n“All I knew was that something had happened that made her dreadfully\\nmiserable, and that she begged me never to speak of it. And if she\\nwould not tell me, she would certainly not speak of it to anyone else.\\nBut what did pass between you? Tell me.”\\n\\n“I have told you.”\\n\\n“When was it?”\\n\\n“When I was at their house the last time.”\\n\\n“Do you know that,” said Darya Alexandrovna, “I am awfully, awfully\\nsorry for her. You suffer only from pride....”\\n\\n“Perhaps so,” said Levin, “but....”\\n\\nShe interrupted him.\\n\\n“But she, poor girl ... I am awfully, awfully sorry for her. Now I see\\nit all.”\\n\\n“Well, Darya Alexandrovna, you must excuse me,” he said, getting up.\\n“Good-bye, Darya Alexandrovna, till we meet again.”\\n\\n“No, wait a minute,” she said, clutching him by the sleeve. “Wait a\\nminute, sit down.”\\n\\n“Please, please, don’t let us talk of this,” he said, sitting down, and\\nat the same time feeling rise up and stir within his heart a hope he\\nhad believed to be buried.\\n\\n“If I did not like you,” she said, and tears came into her eyes; “if I\\ndid not know you, as I do know you....”\\n\\nThe feeling that had seemed dead revived more and more, rose up and\\ntook possession of Levin’s heart.\\n\\n“Yes, I understand it all now,” said Darya Alexandrovna. “You can’t\\nunderstand it; for you men, who are free and make your own choice, it’s\\nalways clear whom you love. But a girl’s in a position of suspense,\\nwith all a woman’s or maiden’s modesty, a girl who sees you men from\\nafar, who takes everything on trust,—a girl may have, and often has,\\nsuch a feeling that she cannot tell what to say.”\\n\\n“Yes, if the heart does not speak....”\\n\\n“No, the heart does speak; but just consider: you men have views about\\na girl, you come to the house, you make friends, you criticize, you\\nwait to see if you have found what you love, and then, when you are\\nsure you love her, you make an offer....”\\n\\n“Well, that’s not quite it.”\\n\\n“Anyway you make an offer, when your love is ripe or when the balance\\nhas completely turned between the two you are choosing from. But a girl\\nis not asked. She is expected to make her choice, and yet she cannot\\nchoose, she can only answer ‘yes’ or ‘no.’”\\n\\n“Yes, to choose between me and Vronsky,” thought Levin, and the dead\\nthing that had come to life within him died again, and only weighed on\\nhis heart and set it aching.\\n\\n“Darya Alexandrovna,” he said, “that’s how one chooses a new dress or\\nsome purchase or other, not love. The choice has been made, and so much\\nthe better.... And there can be no repeating it.”\\n\\n“Ah, pride, pride!” said Darya Alexandrovna, as though despising him\\nfor the baseness of this feeling in comparison with that other feeling\\nwhich only women know. “At the time when you made Kitty an offer she\\nwas just in a position in which she could not answer. She was in doubt.\\nDoubt between you and Vronsky. Him she was seeing every day, and you\\nshe had not seen for a long while. Supposing she had been older ... I,\\nfor instance, in her place could have felt no doubt. I always disliked\\nhim, and so it has turned out.”\\n\\nLevin recalled Kitty’s answer. She had said: “_No, that cannot be_....”\\n\\n“Darya Alexandrovna,” he said dryly, “I appreciate your confidence in\\nme; I believe you are making a mistake. But whether I am right or\\nwrong, that pride you so despise makes any thought of Katerina\\nAlexandrovna out of the question for me,—you understand, utterly out of\\nthe question.”\\n\\n“I will only say one thing more: you know that I am speaking of my\\nsister, whom I love as I love my own children. I don’t say she cared\\nfor you, all I meant to say is that her refusal at that moment proves\\nnothing.”\\n\\n“I don’t know!” said Levin, jumping up. “If you only knew how you are\\nhurting me. It’s just as if a child of yours were dead, and they were\\nto say to you: He would have been like this and like that, and he might\\nhave lived, and how happy you would have been in him. But he’s dead,\\ndead, dead!...”\\n\\n“How absurd you are!” said Darya Alexandrovna, looking with mournful\\ntenderness at Levin’s excitement. “Yes, I see it all more and more\\nclearly,” she went on musingly. “So you won’t come to see us, then,\\nwhen Kitty’s here?”\\n\\n“No, I shan’t come. Of course I won’t avoid meeting Katerina\\nAlexandrovna, but as far as I can, I will try to save her the annoyance\\nof my presence.”\\n\\n“You are very, very absurd,” repeated Darya Alexandrovna, looking with\\ntenderness into his face. “Very well then, let it be as though we had\\nnot spoken of this. What have you come for, Tanya?” she said in French\\nto the little girl who had come in.\\n\\n“Where’s my spade, mamma?”\\n\\n“I speak French, and you must too.”\\n\\nThe little girl tried to say it in French, but could not remember the\\nFrench for spade; the mother prompted her, and then told her in French\\nwhere to look for the spade. And this made a disagreeable impression on\\nLevin.\\n\\nEverything in Darya Alexandrovna’s house and children struck him now as\\nby no means so charming as a little while before. “And what does she\\ntalk French with the children for?” he thought; “how unnatural and\\nfalse it is! And the children feel it so: Learning French and\\nunlearning sincerity,” he thought to himself, unaware that Darya\\nAlexandrovna had thought all that over twenty times already, and yet,\\neven at the cost of some loss of sincerity, believed it necessary to\\nteach her children French in that way.\\n\\n“But why are you going? Do stay a little.”\\n\\nLevin stayed to tea; but his good-humor had vanished, and he felt ill\\nat ease.\\n\\nAfter tea he went out into the hall to order his horses to be put in,\\nand, when he came back, he found Darya Alexandrovna greatly disturbed,\\nwith a troubled face, and tears in her eyes. While Levin had been\\noutside, an incident had occurred which had utterly shattered all the\\nhappiness she had been feeling that day, and her pride in her children.\\nGrisha and Tanya had been fighting over a ball. Darya Alexandrovna,\\nhearing a scream in the nursery, ran in and saw a terrible sight. Tanya\\nwas pulling Grisha’s hair, while he, with a face hideous with rage, was\\nbeating her with his fists wherever he could get at her. Something\\nsnapped in Darya Alexandrovna’s heart when she saw this. It was as if\\ndarkness had swooped down upon her life; she felt that these children\\nof hers, that she was so proud of, were not merely most ordinary, but\\npositively bad, ill-bred children, with coarse, brutal\\npropensities—wicked children.\\n\\nShe could not talk or think of anything else, and she could not speak\\nto Levin of her misery.\\n\\nLevin saw she was unhappy and tried to comfort her, saying that it\\nshowed nothing bad, that all children fight; but, even as he said it,\\nhe was thinking in his heart: “No, I won’t be artificial and talk\\nFrench with my children; but my children won’t be like that. All one\\nhas to do is not spoil children, not to distort their nature, and\\nthey’ll be delightful. No, my children won’t be like that.”\\n\\nHe said good-bye and drove away, and she did not try to keep him 11\\n\\nIn the middle of July the elder of the village on Levin’s sister’s\\nestate, about fifteen miles from Pokrovskoe, came to Levin to report on\\nhow things were going there and on the hay. The chief source of income\\non his sister’s estate was from the riverside meadows. In former years\\nthe hay had been bought by the peasants for twenty roubles the three\\nacres. When Levin took over the management of the estate, he thought on\\nexamining the grasslands that they were worth more, and he fixed the\\nprice at twenty-five roubles the three acres. The peasants would not\\ngive that price, and, as Levin suspected, kept off other purchasers.\\nThen Levin had driven over himself, and arranged to have the grass cut,\\npartly by hired labor, partly at a payment of a certain proportion of\\nthe crop. His own peasants put every hindrance they could in the way of\\nthis new arrangement, but it was carried out, and the first year the\\nmeadows had yielded a profit almost double. The previous year—which was\\nthe third year—the peasants had maintained the same opposition to the\\narrangement, and the hay had been cut on the same system. This year the\\npeasants were doing all the mowing for a third of the hay crop, and the\\nvillage elder had come now to announce that the hay had been cut, and\\nthat, fearing rain, they had invited the counting-house clerk over, had\\ndivided the crop in his presence, and had raked together eleven stacks\\nas the owner’s share. From the vague answers to his question how much\\nhay had been cut on the principal meadow, from the hurry of the village\\nelder who had made the division, not asking leave, from the whole tone\\nof the peasant, Levin perceived that there was something wrong in the\\ndivision of the hay, and made up his mind to drive over himself to look\\ninto the matter.\\n\\nArriving for dinner at the village, and leaving his horse at the\\ncottage of an old friend of his, the husband of his brother’s\\nwet-nurse, Levin went to see the old man in his bee-house, wanting to\\nfind out from him the truth about the hay. Parmenitch, a talkative,\\ncomely old man, gave Levin a very warm welcome, showed him all he was\\ndoing, told him everything about his bees and the swarms of that year;\\nbut gave vague and unwilling answers to Levin’s inquiries about the\\nmowing. This confirmed Levin still more in his suspicions. He went to\\nthe hay fields and examined the stacks. The haystacks could not\\npossibly contain fifty wagon-loads each, and to convict the peasants\\nLevin ordered the wagons that had carried the hay to be brought up\\ndirectly, to lift one stack, and carry it into the barn. There turned\\nout to be only thirty-two loads in the stack. In spite of the village\\nelder’s assertions about the compressibility of hay, and its having\\nsettled down in the stacks, and his swearing that everything had been\\ndone in the fear of God, Levin stuck to his point that the hay had been\\ndivided without his orders, and that, therefore, he would not accept\\nthat hay as fifty loads to a stack. After a prolonged dispute the\\nmatter was decided by the peasants taking these eleven stacks,\\nreckoning them as fifty loads each. The arguments and the division of\\nthe haycocks lasted the whole afternoon. When the last of the hay had\\nbeen divided, Levin, intrusting the superintendence of the rest to the\\ncounting-house clerk, sat down on a haycock marked off by a stake of\\nwillow, and looked admiringly at the meadow swarming with peasants.\\n\\nIn front of him, in the bend of the river beyond the marsh, moved a\\nbright-colored line of peasant women, and the scattered hay was being\\nrapidly formed into gray winding rows over the pale green stubble.\\nAfter the women came the men with pitchforks, and from the gray rows\\nthere were growing up broad, high, soft haycocks. To the left, carts\\nwere rumbling over the meadow that had been already cleared, and one\\nafter another the haycocks vanished, flung up in huge forkfuls, and in\\ntheir place there were rising heavy cartloads of fragrant hay hanging\\nover the horses’ hind-quarters.\\n\\n“What weather for haying! What hay it’ll be!” said an old man,\\nsquatting down beside Levin. “It’s tea, not hay! It’s like scattering\\ngrain to the ducks, the way they pick it up!” he added, pointing to the\\ngrowing haycocks. “Since dinner time they’ve carried a good half of\\nit.”\\n\\n“The last load, eh?” he shouted to a young peasant, who drove by,\\nstanding in the front of an empty cart, shaking the cord reins.\\n\\n“The last, dad!” the lad shouted back, pulling in the horse, and,\\nsmiling, he looked round at a bright, rosy-checked peasant girl who sat\\nin the cart smiling too, and drove on.\\n\\n“Who’s that? Your son?” asked Levin.\\n\\n“My baby,” said the old man with a tender smile.\\n\\n“What a fine fellow!”\\n\\n“The lad’s all right.”\\n\\n“Married already?”\\n\\n“Yes, it’s two years last St. Philip’s day.”\\n\\n“Any children?”\\n\\n“Children indeed! Why, for over a year he was innocent as a babe\\nhimself, and bashful too,” answered the old man. “Well, the hay! It’s\\nas fragrant as tea!” he repeated, wishing to change the subject.\\n\\nLevin looked more attentively at Ivan Parmenov and his wife. They were\\nloading a haycock onto the cart not far from him. Ivan Parmenov was\\nstanding on the cart, taking, laying in place, and stamping down the\\nhuge bundles of hay, which his pretty young wife deftly handed up to\\nhim, at first in armfuls, and then on the pitchfork. The young wife\\nworked easily, merrily, and dexterously. The close-packed hay did not\\nonce break away off her fork. First she gathered it together, stuck the\\nfork into it, then with a rapid, supple movement leaned the whole\\nweight of her body on it, and at once with a bend of her back under the\\nred belt she drew herself up, and arching her full bosom under the\\nwhite smock, with a smart turn swung the fork in her arms, and flung\\nthe bundle of hay high onto the cart. Ivan, obviously doing his best to\\nsave her every minute of unnecessary labor, made haste, opening his\\narms to clutch the bundle and lay it in the cart. As she raked together\\nwhat was left of the hay, the young wife shook off the bits of hay that\\nhad fallen on her neck, and straightening the red kerchief that had\\ndropped forward over her white brow, not browned like her face by the\\nsun, she crept under the cart to tie up the load. Ivan directed her how\\nto fasten the cord to the cross-piece, and at something she said he\\nlaughed aloud. In the expressions of both faces was to be seen\\nvigorous, young, freshly awakened love 12\\n\\nThe load was tied on. Ivan jumped down and took the quiet, sleek horse\\nby the bridle. The young wife flung the rake up on the load, and with a\\nbold step, swinging her arms, she went to join the women, who were\\nforming a ring for the haymakers’ dance. Ivan drove off to the road and\\nfell into line with the other loaded carts. The peasant women, with\\ntheir rakes on their shoulders, gay with bright flowers, and chattering\\nwith ringing, merry voices, walked behind the hay cart. One wild\\nuntrained female voice broke into a song, and sang it alone through a\\nverse, and then the same verse was taken up and repeated by half a\\nhundred strong healthy voices, of all sorts, coarse and fine, singing\\nin unison.\\n\\nThe women, all singing, began to come close to Levin, and he felt as\\nthough a storm were swooping down upon him with a thunder of merriment.\\nThe storm swooped down, enveloped him and the haycock on which he was\\nlying, and the other haycocks, and the wagon-loads, and the whole\\nmeadow and distant fields all seemed to be shaking and singing to the\\nmeasures of this wild merry song with its shouts and whistles and\\nclapping. Levin felt envious of this health and mirthfulness; he longed\\nto take part in the expression of this joy of life. But he could do\\nnothing, and had to lie and look on and listen. When the peasants, with\\ntheir singing, had vanished out of sight and hearing, a weary feeling\\nof despondency at his own isolation, his physical inactivity, his\\nalienation from this world, came over Levin.\\n\\nSome of the very peasants who had been most active in wrangling with\\nhim over the hay, some whom he had treated with contumely, and who had\\ntried to cheat him, those very peasants had greeted him good-humoredly,\\nand evidently had not, were incapable of having any feeling of rancor\\nagainst him, any regret, any recollection even of having tried to\\ndeceive him. All that was drowned in a sea of merry common labor. God\\ngave the day, God gave the strength. And the day and the strength were\\nconsecrated to labor, and that labor was its own reward. For whom the\\nlabor? What would be its fruits? These were idle considerations—beside\\nthe point.\\n\\nOften Levin had admired this life, often he had a sense of envy of the\\nmen who led this life; but today for the first time, especially under\\nthe influence of what he had seen in the attitude of Ivan Parmenov to\\nhis young wife, the idea presented itself definitely to his mind that\\nit was in his power to exchange the dreary, artificial, idle, and\\nindividualistic life he was leading for this laborious, pure, and\\nsocially delightful life.\\n\\nThe old man who had been sitting beside him had long ago gone home; the\\npeople had all separated. Those who lived near had gone home, while\\nthose who came from far were gathered into a group for supper, and to\\nspend the night in the meadow. Levin, unobserved by the peasants, still\\nlay on the haycock, and still looked on and listened and mused. The\\npeasants who remained for the night in the meadow scarcely slept all\\nthe short summer night. At first there was the sound of merry talk and\\nlaughing all together over the supper, then singing again and laughter.\\n\\nAll the long day of toil had left no trace in them but lightness of\\nheart. Before the early dawn all was hushed. Nothing was to be heard\\nbut the night sounds of the frogs that never ceased in the marsh, and\\nthe horses snorting in the mist that rose over the meadow before the\\nmorning. Rousing himself, Levin got up from the haycock, and looking at\\nthe stars, he saw that the night was over.\\n\\n“Well, what am I going to do? How am I to set about it?” he said to\\nhimself, trying to express to himself all the thoughts and feelings he\\nhad passed through in that brief night. All the thoughts and feelings\\nhe had passed through fell into three separate trains of thought. One\\nwas the renunciation of his old life, of his utterly useless education.\\nThis renunciation gave him satisfaction, and was easy and simple.\\nAnother series of thoughts and mental images related to the life he\\nlonged to live now. The simplicity, the purity, the sanity of this life\\nhe felt clearly, and he was convinced he would find in it the content,\\nthe peace, and the dignity, of the lack of which he was so miserably\\nconscious. But a third series of ideas turned upon the question how to\\neffect this transition from the old life to the new. And there nothing\\ntook clear shape for him. “Have a wife? Have work and the necessity of\\nwork? Leave Pokrovskoe? Buy land? Become a member of a peasant\\ncommunity? Marry a peasant girl? How am I to set about it?” he asked\\nhimself again, and could not find an answer. “I haven’t slept all\\nnight, though, and I can’t think it out clearly,” he said to himself.\\n“I’ll work it out later. One thing’s certain, this night has decided my\\nfate. All my old dreams of home life were absurd, not the real thing,”\\nhe told himself. “It’s all ever so much simpler and better....”\\n\\n“How beautiful!” he thought, looking at the strange, as it were,\\nmother-of-pearl shell of white fleecy cloudlets resting right over his\\nhead in the middle of the sky. “How exquisite it all is in this\\nexquisite night! And when was there time for that cloud-shell to form?\\nJust now I looked at the sky, and there was nothing in it—only two\\nwhite streaks. Yes, and so imperceptibly too my views of life changed!”\\n\\nHe went out of the meadow and walked along the highroad towards the\\nvillage. A slight wind arose, and the sky looked gray and sullen. The\\ngloomy moment had come that usually precedes the dawn, the full triumph\\nof light over darkness.\\n\\nShrinking from the cold, Levin walked rapidly, looking at the ground.\\n“What’s that? Someone coming,” he thought, catching the tinkle of\\nbells, and lifting his head. Forty paces from him a carriage with four\\nhorses harnessed abreast was driving towards him along the grassy road\\non which he was walking. The shaft-horses were tilted against the\\nshafts by the ruts, but the dexterous driver sitting on the box held\\nthe shaft over the ruts, so that the wheels ran on the smooth part of\\nthe road.\\n\\nThis was all Levin noticed, and without wondering who it could be, he\\ngazed absently at the coach.\\n\\nIn the coach was an old lady dozing in one corner, and at the window,\\nevidently only just awake, sat a young girl holding in both hands the\\nribbons of a white cap. With a face full of light and thought, full of\\na subtle, complex inner life, that was remote from Levin, she was\\ngazing beyond him at the glow of the sunrise.\\n\\nAt the very instant when this apparition was vanishing, the truthful\\neyes glanced at him. She recognized him, and her face lighted up with\\nwondering delight.\\n\\nHe could not be mistaken. There were no other eyes like those in the\\nworld. There was only one creature in the world that could concentrate\\nfor him all the brightness and meaning of life. It was she. It was\\nKitty. He understood that she was driving to Ergushovo from the railway\\nstation. And everything that had been stirring Levin during that\\nsleepless night, all the resolutions he had made, all vanished at once.\\nHe recalled with horror his dreams of marrying a peasant girl. There\\nonly, in the carriage that had crossed over to the other side of the\\nroad, and was rapidly disappearing, there only could he find the\\nsolution of the riddle of his life, which had weighed so agonizingly\\nupon him of late.\\n\\nShe did not look out again. The sound of the carriage-springs was no\\nlonger audible, the bells could scarcely be heard. The barking of dogs\\nshowed the carriage had reached the village, and all that was left was\\nthe empty fields all round, the village in front, and he himself\\nisolated and apart from it all, wandering lonely along the deserted\\nhighroad.\\n\\nHe glanced at the sky, expecting to find there the cloud shell he had\\nbeen admiring and taking as the symbol of the ideas and feelings of\\nthat night. There was nothing in the sky in the least like a shell.\\nThere, in the remote heights above, a mysterious change had been\\naccomplished. There was no trace of shell, and there was stretched over\\nfully half the sky an even cover of tiny and ever tinier cloudlets. The\\nsky had grown blue and bright; and with the same softness, but with the\\nsame remoteness, it met his questioning gaze.\\n\\n“No,” he said to himself, “however good that life of simplicity and\\ntoil may be, I cannot go back to it. I love _her_ 13\\n\\nNone but those who were most intimate with Alexey Alexandrovitch knew\\nthat, while on the surface the coldest and most reasonable of men, he\\nhad one weakness quite opposed to the general trend of his character.\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch could not hear or see a child or woman crying\\nwithout being moved. The sight of tears threw him into a state of\\nnervous agitation, and he utterly lost all power of reflection. The\\nchief secretary of his department and his private secretary were aware\\nof this, and used to warn women who came with petitions on no account\\nto give way to tears, if they did not want to ruin their chances. “He\\nwill get angry, and will not listen to you,” they used to say. And as a\\nfact, in such cases the emotional disturbance set up in Alexey\\nAlexandrovitch by the sight of tears found expression in hasty anger.\\n“I can do nothing. Kindly leave the room!” he would commonly cry in\\nsuch cases.\\n\\nWhen returning from the races Anna had informed him of her relations\\nwith Vronsky, and immediately afterwards had burst into tears, hiding\\nher face in her hands, Alexey Alexandrovitch, for all the fury aroused\\nin him against her, was aware at the same time of a rush of that\\nemotional disturbance always produced in him by tears. Conscious of it,\\nand conscious that any expression of his feelings at that minute would\\nbe out of keeping with the position, he tried to suppress every\\nmanifestation of life in himself, and so neither stirred nor looked at\\nher. This was what had caused that strange expression of deathlike\\nrigidity in his face which had so impressed Anna.\\n\\nWhen they reached the house he helped her to get out of the carriage,\\nand making an effort to master himself, took leave of her with his\\nusual urbanity, and uttered that phrase that bound him to nothing; he\\nsaid that tomorrow he would let her know his decision.\\n\\nHis wife’s words, confirming his worst suspicions, had sent a cruel\\npang to the heart of Alexey Alexandrovitch. That pang was intensified\\nby the strange feeling of physical pity for her set up by her tears.\\nBut when he was all alone in the carriage Alexey Alexandrovitch, to his\\nsurprise and delight, felt complete relief both from this pity and from\\nthe doubts and agonies of jealousy.\\n\\nHe experienced the sensations of a man who has had a tooth out after\\nsuffering long from toothache. After a fearful agony and a sense of\\nsomething huge, bigger than the head itself, being torn out of his jaw,\\nthe sufferer, hardly able to believe in his own good luck, feels all at\\nonce that what has so long poisoned his existence and enchained his\\nattention, exists no longer, and that he can live and think again, and\\ntake interest in other things besides his tooth. This feeling Alexey\\nAlexandrovitch was experiencing. The agony had been strange and\\nterrible, but now it was over; he felt that he could live again and\\nthink of something other than his wife.\\n\\n“No honor, no heart, no religion; a corrupt woman. I always knew it and\\nalways saw it, though I tried to deceive myself to spare her,” he said\\nto himself. And it actually seemed to him that he always had seen it:\\nhe recalled incidents of their past life, in which he had never seen\\nanything wrong before—now these incidents proved clearly that she had\\nalways been a corrupt woman. “I made a mistake in linking my life to\\nhers; but there was nothing wrong in my mistake, and so I cannot be\\nunhappy. It’s not I that am to blame,” he told himself, “but she. But I\\nhave nothing to do with her. She does not exist for me....”\\n\\nEverything relating to her and her son, towards whom his sentiments\\nwere as much changed as towards her, ceased to interest him. The only\\nthing that interested him now was the question of in what way he could\\nbest, with most propriety and comfort for himself, and thus with most\\njustice, extricate himself from the mud with which she had spattered\\nhim in her fall, and then proceed along his path of active, honorable,\\nand useful existence.\\n\\n“I cannot be made unhappy by the fact that a contemptible woman has\\ncommitted a crime. I have only to find the best way out of the\\ndifficult position in which she has placed me. And I shall find it,” he\\nsaid to himself, frowning more and more. “I’m not the first nor the\\nlast.” And to say nothing of historical instances dating from the “Fair\\nHelen” of Menelaus, recently revived in the memory of all, a whole list\\nof contemporary examples of husbands with unfaithful wives in the\\nhighest society rose before Alexey Alexandrovitch’s imagination.\\n“Daryalov, Poltavsky, Prince Karibanov, Count Paskudin, Dram.... Yes,\\neven Dram, such an honest, capable fellow ... Semyonov, Tchagin,\\nSigonin,” Alexey Alexandrovitch remembered. “Admitting that a certain\\nquite irrational _ridicule_ falls to the lot of these men, yet I never\\nsaw anything but a misfortune in it, and always felt sympathy for it,”\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch said to himself, though indeed this was not the\\nfact, and he had never felt sympathy for misfortunes of that kind, but\\nthe more frequently he had heard of instances of unfaithful wives\\nbetraying their husbands, the more highly he had thought of himself.\\n“It is a misfortune which may befall anyone. And this misfortune has\\nbefallen me. The only thing to be done is to make the best of the\\nposition.”\\n\\nAnd he began passing in review the methods of proceeding of men who had\\nbeen in the same position that he was in.\\n\\n“Daryalov fought a duel....”\\n\\nThe duel had particularly fascinated the thoughts of Alexey\\nAlexandrovitch in his youth, just because he was physically a coward,\\nand was himself well aware of the fact. Alexey Alexandrovitch could not\\nwithout horror contemplate the idea of a pistol aimed at himself, and\\nhad never made use of any weapon in his life. This horror had in his\\nyouth set him pondering on dueling, and picturing himself in a position\\nin which he would have to expose his life to danger. Having attained\\nsuccess and an established position in the world, he had long ago\\nforgotten this feeling; but the habitual bent of feeling reasserted\\nitself, and dread of his own cowardice proved even now so strong that\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch spent a long while thinking over the question of\\ndueling in all its aspects, and hugging the idea of a duel, though he\\nwas fully aware beforehand that he would never under any circumstances\\nfight one.\\n\\n“There’s no doubt our society is still so barbarous (it’s not the same\\nin England) that very many”—and among these were those whose opinion\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch particularly valued—“look favorably on the duel;\\nbut what result is attained by it? Suppose I call him out,” Alexey\\nAlexandrovitch went on to himself, and vividly picturing the night he\\nwould spend after the challenge, and the pistol aimed at him, he\\nshuddered, and knew that he never would do it—“suppose I call him out.\\nSuppose I am taught,” he went on musing, “to shoot; I press the\\ntrigger,” he said to himself, closing his eyes, “and it turns out I\\nhave killed him,” Alexey Alexandrovitch said to himself, and he shook\\nhis head as though to dispel such silly ideas. “What sense is there in\\nmurdering a man in order to define one’s relation to a guilty wife and\\nson? I should still just as much have to decide what I ought to do with\\nher. But what is more probable and what would doubtless occur—I should\\nbe killed or wounded. I, the innocent person, should be the\\nvictim—killed or wounded. It’s even more senseless. But apart from\\nthat, a challenge to fight would be an act hardly honest on my side.\\nDon’t I know perfectly well that my friends would never allow me to\\nfight a duel—would never allow the life of a statesman, needed by\\nRussia, to be exposed to danger? Knowing perfectly well beforehand that\\nthe matter would never come to real danger, it would amount to my\\nsimply trying to gain a certain sham reputation by such a challenge.\\nThat would be dishonest, that would be false, that would be deceiving\\nmyself and others. A duel is quite irrational, and no one expects it of\\nme. My aim is simply to safeguard my reputation, which is essential for\\nthe uninterrupted pursuit of my public duties.” Official duties, which\\nhad always been of great consequence in Alexey Alexandrovitch’s eyes,\\nseemed of special importance to his mind at this moment. Considering\\nand rejecting the duel, Alexey Alexandrovitch turned to divorce—another\\nsolution selected by several of the husbands he remembered. Passing in\\nmental review all the instances he knew of divorces (there were plenty\\nof them in the very highest society with which he was very familiar),\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch could not find a single example in which the\\nobject of divorce was that which he had in view. In all these instances\\nthe husband had practically ceded or sold his unfaithful wife, and the\\nvery party which, being in fault, had not the right to contract a fresh\\nmarriage, had formed counterfeit, pseudo-matrimonial ties with a\\nself-styled husband. In his own case, Alexey Alexandrovitch saw that a\\nlegal divorce, that is to say, one in which only the guilty wife would\\nbe repudiated, was impossible of attainment. He saw that the complex\\nconditions of the life they led made the coarse proofs of his wife’s\\nguilt, required by the law, out of the question; he saw that a certain\\nrefinement in that life would not admit of such proofs being brought\\nforward, even if he had them, and that to bring forward such proofs\\nwould damage him in the public estimation more than it would her.\\n\\nAn attempt at divorce could lead to nothing but a public scandal, which\\nwould be a perfect godsend to his enemies for calumny and attacks on\\nhis high position in society. His chief object, to define the position\\nwith the least amount of disturbance possible, would not be attained by\\ndivorce either. Moreover, in the event of divorce, or even of an\\nattempt to obtain a divorce, it was obvious that the wife broke off all\\nrelations with the husband and threw in her lot with the lover. And in\\nspite of the complete, as he supposed, contempt and indifference he now\\nfelt for his wife, at the bottom of his heart Alexey Alexandrovitch\\nstill had one feeling left in regard to her—a disinclination to see her\\nfree to throw in her lot with Vronsky, so that her crime would be to\\nher advantage. The mere notion of this so exasperated Alexey\\nAlexandrovitch, that directly it rose to his mind he groaned with\\ninward agony, and got up and changed his place in the carriage, and for\\na long while after, he sat with scowling brows, wrapping his numbed and\\nbony legs in the fleecy rug.\\n\\n“Apart from formal divorce, One might still do like Karibanov,\\nPaskudin, and that good fellow Dram—that is, separate from one’s wife,”\\nhe went on thinking, when he had regained his composure. But this step\\ntoo presented the same drawback of public scandal as a divorce, and\\nwhat was more, a separation, quite as much as a regular divorce, flung\\nhis wife into the arms of Vronsky. “No, it’s out of the question, out\\nof the question!” he said again, twisting his rug about him again. “I\\ncannot be unhappy, but neither she nor he ought to be happy.”\\n\\nThe feeling of jealousy, which had tortured him during the period of\\nuncertainty, had passed away at the instant when the tooth had been\\nwith agony extracted by his wife’s words. But that feeling had been\\nreplaced by another, the desire, not merely that she should not be\\ntriumphant, but that she should get due punishment for her crime. He\\ndid not acknowledge this feeling, but at the bottom of his heart he\\nlonged for her to suffer for having destroyed his peace of mind—his\\nhonor. And going once again over the conditions inseparable from a\\nduel, a divorce, a separation, and once again rejecting them, Alexey\\nAlexandrovitch felt convinced that there was only one solution,—to keep\\nher with him, concealing what had happened from the world, and using\\nevery measure in his power to break off the intrigue, and still\\nmore—though this he did not admit to himself—to punish her. “I must\\ninform her of my conclusion, that thinking over the terrible position\\nin which she has placed her family, all other solutions will be worse\\nfor both sides than an external _status quo_, and that such I agree to\\nretain, on the strict condition of obedience on her part to my wishes,\\nthat is to say, cessation of all intercourse with her lover.” When this\\ndecision had been finally adopted, another weighty consideration\\noccurred to Alexey Alexandrovitch in support of it. “By such a course\\nonly shall I be acting in accordance with the dictates of religion,” he\\ntold himself. “In adopting this course, I am not casting off a guilty\\nwife, but giving her a chance of amendment; and, indeed, difficult as\\nthe task will be to me, I shall devote part of my energies to her\\nreformation and salvation.”\\n\\nThough Alexey Alexandrovitch was perfectly aware that he could not\\nexert any moral influence over his wife, that such an attempt at\\nreformation could lead to nothing but falsity; though in passing\\nthrough these difficult moments he had not once thought of seeking\\nguidance in religion, yet now, when his conclusion corresponded, as it\\nseemed to him, with the requirements of religion, this religious\\nsanction to his decision gave him complete satisfaction, and to some\\nextent restored his peace of mind. He was pleased to think that, even\\nin such an important crisis in life, no one would be able to say that\\nhe had not acted in accordance with the principles of that religion\\nwhose banner he had always held aloft amid the general coolness and\\nindifference. As he pondered over subsequent developments, Alexey\\nAlexandrovitch did not see, indeed, why his relations with his wife\\nshould not remain practically the same as before. No doubt, she could\\nnever regain his esteem, but there was not, and there could not be, any\\nsort of reason that his existence should be troubled, and that he\\nshould suffer because she was a bad and faithless wife. “Yes, time will\\npass; time, which arranges all things, and the old relations will be\\nreestablished,” Alexey Alexandrovitch told himself; “so far\\nreestablished, that is, that I shall not be sensible of a break in the\\ncontinuity of my life. She is bound to be unhappy, but I am not to\\nblame, and so I cannot be unhappy 14\\n\\nAs he neared Petersburg, Alexey Alexandrovitch not only adhered\\nentirely to his decision, but was even composing in his head the letter\\nhe would write to his wife. Going into the porter’s room, Alexey\\nAlexandrovitch glanced at the letters and papers brought from his\\noffice, and directed that they should be brought to him in his study.\\n\\n“The horses can be taken out and I will see no one,” he said in answer\\nto the porter, with a certain pleasure, indicative of his agreeable\\nframe of mind, emphasizing the words, “see no one.”\\n\\nIn his study Alexey Alexandrovitch walked up and down twice, and\\nstopped at an immense writing-table, on which six candles had already\\nbeen lighted by the valet who had preceded him. He cracked his knuckles\\nand sat down, sorting out his writing appurtenances. Putting his elbows\\non the table, he bent his head on one side, thought a minute, and began\\nto write, without pausing for a second. He wrote without using any form\\nof address to her, and wrote in French, making use of the plural\\n“_vous_,” which has not the same note of coldness as the corresponding\\nRussian form.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“At our last conversation, I notified you of my intention to\\ncommunicate to you my decision in regard to the subject of that\\nconversation. Having carefully considered everything, I am writing now\\nwith the object of fulfilling that promise. My decision is as follows.\\nWhatever your conduct may have been, I do not consider myself justified\\nin breaking the ties in which we are bound by a Higher Power. The\\nfamily cannot be broken up by a whim, a caprice, or even by the sin of\\none of the partners in the marriage, and our life must go on as it has\\ndone in the past. This is essential for me, for you, and for our son. I\\nam fully persuaded that you have repented and do repent of what has\\ncalled forth the present letter, and that you will cooperate with me in\\neradicating the cause of our estrangement, and forgetting the past. In\\nthe contrary event, you can conjecture what awaits you and your son.\\nAll this I hope to discuss more in detail in a personal interview. As\\nthe season is drawing to a close, I would beg you to return to\\nPetersburg as quickly as possible, not later than Tuesday. All\\nnecessary preparations shall be made for your arrival here. I beg you\\nto note that I attach particular significance to compliance with this\\nrequest.\\n\\nA. Karenin\\n\\n“_P.S._—I enclose the money which may be needed for your expenses.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHe read the letter through and felt pleased with it, and especially\\nthat he had remembered to enclose money: there was not a harsh word,\\nnot a reproach in it, nor was there undue indulgence. Most of all, it\\nwas a golden bridge for return. Folding the letter and smoothing it\\nwith a massive ivory knife, and putting it in an envelope with the\\nmoney, he rang the bell with the gratification it always afforded him\\nto use the well arranged appointments of his writing-table.\\n\\n“Give this to the courier to be delivered to Anna Arkadyevna tomorrow\\nat the summer villa,” he said, getting up.\\n\\n“Certainly, your excellency; tea to be served in the study?”\\n\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch ordered tea to be brought to the study, and\\nplaying with the massive paper-knife, he moved to his easy chair, near\\nwhich there had been placed ready for him a lamp and the French work on\\nEgyptian hieroglyphics that he had begun. Over the easy chair there\\nhung in a gold frame an oval portrait of Anna, a fine painting by a\\ncelebrated artist. Alexey Alexandrovitch glanced at it. The\\nunfathomable eyes gazed ironically and insolently at him. Insufferably\\ninsolent and challenging was the effect in Alexey Alexandrovitch’s eyes\\nof the black lace about the head, admirably touched in by the painter,\\nthe black hair and handsome white hand with one finger lifted, covered\\nwith rings. After looking at the portrait for a minute, Alexey\\nAlexandrovitch shuddered so that his lips quivered and he uttered the\\nsound “brrr,” and turned away. He made haste to sit down in his easy\\nchair and opened the book. He tried to read, but he could not revive\\nthe very vivid interest he had felt before in Egyptian hieroglyphics.\\nHe looked at the book and thought of something else. He thought not of\\nhis wife, but of a complication that had arisen in his official life,\\nwhich at the time constituted the chief interest of it. He felt that he\\nhad penetrated more deeply than ever before into this intricate affair,\\nand that he had originated a leading idea—he could say it without\\nself-flattery—calculated to clear up the whole business, to strengthen\\nhim in his official career, to discomfit his enemies, and thereby to be\\nof the greatest benefit to the government. Directly the servant had set\\nthe tea and left the room, Alexey Alexandrovitch got up and went to the\\nwriting-table. Moving into the middle of the table a portfolio of\\npapers, with a scarcely perceptible smile of self-satisfaction, he took\\na pencil from a rack and plunged into the perusal of a complex report\\nrelating to the present complication. The complication was of this\\nnature: Alexey Alexandrovitch’s characteristic quality as a politician,\\nthat special individual qualification that every rising functionary\\npossesses, the qualification that with his unflagging ambition, his\\nreserve, his honesty, and with his self-confidence had made his career,\\nwas his contempt for red tape, his cutting down of correspondence, his\\ndirect contact, wherever possible, with the living fact, and his\\neconomy. It happened that the famous Commission of the 2nd of June had\\nset on foot an inquiry into the irrigation of lands in the Zaraisky\\nprovince, which fell under Alexey Alexandrovitch’s department, and was\\na glaring example of fruitless expenditure and paper reforms. Alexey\\nAlexandrovitch was aware of the truth of this. The irrigation of these\\nlands in the Zaraisky province had been initiated by the predecessor of\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch’s predecessor. And vast sums of money had\\nactually been spent and were still being spent on this business, and\\nutterly unproductively, and the whole business could obviously lead to\\nnothing whatever. Alexey Alexandrovitch had perceived this at once on\\nentering office, and would have liked to lay hands on the Board of\\nIrrigation. But at first, when he did not yet feel secure in his\\nposition, he knew it would affect too many interests, and would be\\ninjudicious. Later on he had been engrossed in other questions, and had\\nsimply forgotten the Board of Irrigation. It went of itself, like all\\nsuch boards, by the mere force of inertia. (Many people gained their\\nlivelihood by the Board of Irrigation, especially one highly\\nconscientious and musical family: all the daughters played on stringed\\ninstruments, and Alexey Alexandrovitch knew the family and had stood\\ngodfather to one of the elder daughters.) The raising of this question\\nby a hostile department was in Alexey Alexandrovitch’s opinion a\\ndishonorable proceeding, seeing that in every department there were\\nthings similar and worse, which no one inquired into, for well-known\\nreasons of official etiquette. However, now that the glove had been\\nthrown down to him, he had boldly picked it up and demanded the\\nappointment of a special commission to investigate and verify the\\nworking of the Board of Irrigation of the lands in the Zaraisky\\nprovince. But in compensation he gave no quarter to the enemy either.\\nHe demanded the appointment of another special commission to inquire\\ninto the question of the Native Tribes Organization Committee. The\\nquestion of the Native Tribes had been brought up incidentally in the\\nCommission of the 2nd of June, and had been pressed forward actively by\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch as one admitting of no delay on account of the\\ndeplorable condition of the native tribes. In the commission this\\nquestion had been a ground of contention between several departments.\\nThe department hostile to Alexey Alexandrovitch proved that the\\ncondition of the native tribes was exceedingly flourishing, that the\\nproposed reconstruction might be the ruin of their prosperity, and that\\nif there were anything wrong, it arose mainly from the failure on the\\npart of Alexey Alexandrovitch’s department to carry out the measures\\nprescribed by law. Now Alexey Alexandrovitch intended to demand: First,\\nthat a new commission should be formed which should be empowered to\\ninvestigate the condition of the native tribes on the spot; secondly,\\nif it should appear that the condition of the native tribes actually\\nwas such as it appeared to be from the official documents in the hands\\nof the committee, that another new scientific commission should be\\nappointed to investigate the deplorable condition of the native tribes\\nfrom the—(1) political, (2) administrative, (3) economic, (4)\\nethnographical, (5) material, and (6) religious points of view;\\nthirdly, that evidence should be required from the rival department of\\nthe measures that had been taken during the last ten years by that\\ndepartment for averting the disastrous conditions in which the native\\ntribes were now placed; and fourthly and finally, that that department\\nexplain why it had, as appeared from the evidence before the committee,\\nfrom No. 17,015 and 18,038, from December 5, 1863, and June 7, 1864,\\nacted in direct contravention of the intent of the law T... Act 18, and\\nthe note to Act 36. A flash of eagerness suffused the face of Alexey\\nAlexandrovitch as he rapidly wrote out a synopsis of these ideas for\\nhis own benefit. Having filled a sheet of paper, he got up, rang, and\\nsent a note to the chief secretary of his department to look up certain\\nnecessary facts for him. Getting up and walking about the room, he\\nglanced again at the portrait, frowned, and smiled contemptuously.\\nAfter reading a little more of the book on Egyptian hieroglyphics, and\\nrenewing his interest in it, Alexey Alexandrovitch went to bed at\\neleven o’clock, and recollecting as he lay in bed the incident with his\\nwife, he saw it now in by no means such a gloomy light 15\\n\\nThough Anna had obstinately and with exasperation contradicted Vronsky\\nwhen he told her their position was impossible, at the bottom of her\\nheart she regarded her own position as false and dishonorable, and she\\nlonged with her whole soul to change it. On the way home from the races\\nshe had told her husband the truth in a moment of excitement, and in\\nspite of the agony she had suffered in doing so, she was glad of it.\\nAfter her husband had left her, she told herself that she was glad,\\nthat now everything was made clear, and at least there would be no more\\nlying and deception. It seemed to her beyond doubt that her position\\nwas now made clear forever. It might be bad, this new position, but it\\nwould be clear; there would be no indefiniteness or falsehood about it.\\nThe pain she had caused herself and her husband in uttering those words\\nwould be rewarded now by everything being made clear, she thought. That\\nevening she saw Vronsky, but she did not tell him of what had passed\\nbetween her and her husband, though, to make the position definite, it\\nwas necessary to tell him.\\n\\nWhen she woke up next morning the first thing that rose to her mind was\\nwhat she had said to her husband, and those words seemed to her so\\nawful that she could not conceive now how she could have brought\\nherself to utter those strange, coarse words, and could not imagine\\nwhat would come of it. But the words were spoken, and Alexey\\nAlexandrovitch had gone away without saying anything. “I saw Vronsky\\nand did not tell him. At the very instant he was going away I would\\nhave turned him back and told him, but I changed my mind, because it\\nwas strange that I had not told him the first minute. Why was it I\\nwanted to tell him and did not tell him?” And in answer to this\\nquestion a burning blush of shame spread over her face. She knew what\\nhad kept her from it, she knew that she had been ashamed. Her position,\\nwhich had seemed to her simplified the night before, suddenly struck\\nher now as not only not simple, but as absolutely hopeless. She felt\\nterrified at the disgrace, of which she had not ever thought before.\\nDirectly she thought of what her husband would do, the most terrible\\nideas came to her mind. She had a vision of being turned out of the\\nhouse, of her shame being proclaimed to all the world. She asked\\nherself where she should go when she was turned out of the house, and\\nshe could not find an answer.\\n\\nWhen she thought of Vronsky, it seemed to her that he did not love her,\\nthat he was already beginning to be tired of her, that she could not\\noffer herself to him, and she felt bitter against him for it. It seemed\\nto her that the words that she had spoken to her husband, and had\\ncontinually repeated in her imagination, she had said to everyone, and\\neveryone had heard them. She could not bring herself to look those of\\nher own household in the face. She could not bring herself to call her\\nmaid, and still less go downstairs and see her son and his governess.\\n\\nThe maid, who had been listening at her door for a long while, came\\ninto her room of her own accord. Anna glanced inquiringly into her\\nface, and blushed with a scared look. The maid begged her pardon for\\ncoming in, saying that she had fancied the bell rang. She brought her\\nclothes and a note. The note was from Betsy. Betsy reminded her that\\nLiza Merkalova and Baroness Shtoltz were coming to play croquet with\\nher that morning with their adorers, Kaluzhsky and old Stremov. “Come,\\nif only as a study in morals. I shall expect you,” she finished.\\n\\nAnna read the note and heaved a deep sigh.\\n\\n“Nothing, I need nothing,” she said to Annushka, who was rearranging\\nthe bottles and brushes on the dressing table. “You can go. I’ll dress\\nat once and come down. I need nothing.”\\n\\nAnnushka went out, but Anna did not begin dressing, and sat in the same\\nposition, her head and hands hanging listlessly, and every now and then\\nshe shivered all over, seemed as though she would make some gesture,\\nutter some word, and sank back into lifelessness again. She repeated\\ncontinually, “My God! my God!” But neither “God” nor “my” had any\\nmeaning to her. The idea of seeking help in her difficulty in religion\\nwas as remote from her as seeking help from Alexey Alexandrovitch\\nhimself, although she had never had doubts of the faith in which she\\nhad been brought up. She knew that the support of religion was possible\\nonly upon condition of renouncing what made up for her the whole\\nmeaning of life. She was not simply miserable, she began to feel alarm\\nat the new spiritual condition, never experienced before, in which she\\nfound herself. She felt as though everything were beginning to be\\ndouble in her soul, just as objects sometimes appear double to\\nover-tired eyes. She hardly knew at times what it was she feared, and\\nwhat she hoped for. Whether she feared or desired what had happened, or\\nwhat was going to happen, and exactly what she longed for, she could\\nnot have said.\\n\\n“Ah, what am I doing!” she said to herself, feeling a sudden thrill of\\npain in both sides of her head. When she came to herself, she saw that\\nshe was holding her hair in both hands, each side of her temples, and\\npulling it. She jumped up, and began walking about.\\n\\n“The coffee is ready, and mademoiselle and Seryozha are waiting,” said\\nAnnushka, coming back again and finding Anna in the same position.\\n\\n“Seryozha? What about Seryozha?” Anna asked, with sudden eagerness,\\nrecollecting her son’s existence for the first time that morning.\\n\\n“He’s been naughty, I think,” answered Annushka with a smile.\\n\\n“In what way?”\\n\\n“Some peaches were lying on the table in the corner room. I think he\\nslipped in and ate one of them on the sly.”\\n\\nThe recollection of her son suddenly roused Anna from the helpless\\ncondition in which she found herself. She recalled the partly sincere,\\nthough greatly exaggerated, rôle of the mother living for her child,\\nwhich she had taken up of late years, and she felt with joy that in the\\nplight in which she found herself she had a support, quite apart from\\nher relation to her husband or to Vronsky. This support was her son. In\\nwhatever position she might be placed, she could not lose her son. Her\\nhusband might put her to shame and turn her out, Vronsky might grow\\ncold to her and go on living his own life apart (she thought of him\\nagain with bitterness and reproach); she could not leave her son. She\\nhad an aim in life. And she must act; act to secure this relation to\\nher son, so that he might not be taken from her. Quickly indeed, as\\nquickly as possible, she must take action before he was taken from her.\\nShe must take her son and go away. Here was the one thing she had to do\\nnow. She needed consolation. She must be calm, and get out of this\\ninsufferable position. The thought of immediate action binding her to\\nher son, of going away somewhere with him, gave her this consolation.\\n\\nShe dressed quickly, went downstairs, and with resolute steps walked\\ninto the drawing-room, where she found, as usual, waiting for her, the\\ncoffee, Seryozha, and his governess. Seryozha, all in white, with his\\nback and head bent, was standing at a table under a looking-glass, and\\nwith an expression of intense concentration which she knew well, and in\\nwhich he resembled his father, he was doing something to the flowers he\\ncarried.\\n\\nThe governess had a particularly severe expression. Seryozha screamed\\nshrilly, as he often did, “Ah, mamma!” and stopped, hesitating whether\\nto go to greet his mother and put down the flowers, or to finish making\\nthe wreath and go with the flowers.\\n\\nThe governess, after saying good-morning, began a long and detailed\\naccount of Seryozha’s naughtiness, but Anna did not hear her; she was\\nconsidering whether she would take her with her or not. “No, I won’t\\ntake her,” she decided. “I’ll go alone with my child.”\\n\\n“Yes, it’s very wrong,” said Anna, and taking her son by the shoulder\\nshe looked at him, not severely, but with a timid glance that\\nbewildered and delighted the boy, and she kissed him. “Leave him to\\nme,” she said to the astonished governess, and not letting go of her\\nson, she sat down at the table, where coffee was set ready for her.\\n\\n“Mamma! I ... I ... didn’t....” he said, trying to make out from her\\nexpression what was in store for him in regard to the peaches.\\n\\n“Seryozha,” she said, as soon as the governess had left the room, “that\\nwas wrong, but you’ll never do it again, will you?... You love me?”\\n\\nShe felt that the tears were coming into her eyes. “Can I help loving\\nhim?” she said to herself, looking deeply into his scared and at the\\nsame time delighted eyes. “And can he ever join his father in punishing\\nme? Is it possible he will not feel for me?” Tears were already flowing\\ndown her face, and to hide them she got up abruptly and almost ran out\\non to the terrace.\\n\\nAfter the thunder showers of the last few days, cold, bright weather\\nhad set in. The air was cold in the bright sun that filtered through\\nthe freshly washed leaves.\\n\\nShe shivered, both from the cold and from the inward horror which had\\nclutched her with fresh force in the open air.\\n\\n“Run along, run along to Mariette,” she said to Seryozha, who had\\nfollowed her out, and she began walking up and down on the straw\\nmatting of the terrace. “Can it be that they won’t forgive me, won’t\\nunderstand how it all couldn’t be helped?” she said to herself.\\n\\nStanding still, and looking at the tops of the aspen trees waving in\\nthe wind, with their freshly washed, brightly shining leaves in the\\ncold sunshine, she knew that they would not forgive her, that everyone\\nand everything would be merciless to her now as was that sky, that\\ngreen. And again she felt that everything was split in two in her soul.\\n“I mustn’t, mustn’t think,” she said to herself. “I must get ready. To\\ngo where? When? Whom to take with me? Yes, to Moscow by the evening\\ntrain. Annushka and Seryozha, and only the most necessary things. But\\nfirst I must write to them both.” She went quickly indoors into her\\nboudoir, sat down at the table, and wrote to her husband:—“After what\\nhas happened, I cannot remain any longer in your house. I am going\\naway, and taking my son with me. I don’t know the law, and so I don’t\\nknow with which of the parents the son should remain; but I take him\\nwith me because I cannot live without him. Be generous, leave him to\\nme.”\\n\\nUp to this point she wrote rapidly and naturally, but the appeal to his\\ngenerosity, a quality she did not recognize in him, and the necessity\\nof winding up the letter with something touching, pulled her up. “Of my\\nfault and my remorse I cannot speak, because....”\\n\\nShe stopped again, finding no connection in her ideas. “No,” she said\\nto herself, “there’s no need of anything,” and tearing up the letter,\\nshe wrote it again, leaving out the allusion to generosity, and sealed\\nit up.\\n\\nAnother letter had to be written to Vronsky. “I have told my husband,”\\nshe wrote, and she sat a long while unable to write more. It was so\\ncoarse, so unfeminine. “And what more am I to write to him?” she said\\nto herself. Again a flush of shame spread over her face; she recalled\\nhis composure, and a feeling of anger against him impelled her to tear\\nthe sheet with the phrase she had written into tiny bits. “No need of\\nanything,” she said to herself, and closing her blotting-case she went\\nupstairs, told the governess and the servants that she was going that\\nday to Moscow, and at once set to work to pack up her things 16\\n\\nAll the rooms of the summer villa were full of porters, gardeners, and\\nfootmen going to and fro carrying out things. Cupboards and chests were\\nopen; twice they had sent to the shop for cord; pieces of newspaper\\nwere tossing about on the floor. Two trunks, some bags and strapped-up\\nrugs, had been carried down into the hall. The carriage and two hired\\ncabs were waiting at the steps. Anna, forgetting her inward agitation\\nin the work of packing, was standing at a table in her boudoir, packing\\nher traveling bag, when Annushka called her attention to the rattle of\\nsome carriage driving up. Anna looked out of the window and saw Alexey\\nAlexandrovitch’s courier on the steps, ringing at the front door bell.\\n\\n“Run and find out what it is,” she said, and with a calm sense of being\\nprepared for anything, she sat down in a low chair, folding her hands\\non her knees. A footman brought in a thick packet directed in Alexey\\nAlexandrovitch’s hand.\\n\\n“The courier has orders to wait for an answer,” he said.\\n\\n“Very well,” she said, and as soon as he had left the room she tore\\nopen the letter with trembling fingers. A roll of unfolded notes done\\nup in a wrapper fell out of it. She disengaged the letter and began\\nreading it at the end. “Preparations shall be made for your arrival\\nhere ... I attach particular significance to compliance....” she read.\\nShe ran on, then back, read it all through, and once more read the\\nletter all through again from the beginning. When she had finished, she\\nfelt that she was cold all over, and that a fearful calamity, such as\\nshe had not expected, had burst upon her.\\n\\nIn the morning she had regretted that she had spoken to her husband,\\nand wished for nothing so much as that those words could be unspoken.\\nAnd here this letter regarded them as unspoken, and gave her what she\\nhad wanted. But now this letter seemed to her more awful than anything\\nshe had been able to conceive.\\n\\n“He’s right!” she said; “of course, he’s always right; he’s a\\nChristian, he’s generous! Yes, vile, base creature! And no one\\nunderstands it except me, and no one ever will; and I can’t explain it.\\nThey say he’s so religious, so high-principled, so upright, so clever;\\nbut they don’t see what I’ve seen. They don’t know how he has crushed\\nmy life for eight years, crushed everything that was living in me—he\\nhas not once even thought that I’m a live woman who must have love.\\nThey don’t know how at every step he’s humiliated me, and been just as\\npleased with himself. Haven’t I striven, striven with all my strength,\\nto find something to give meaning to my life? Haven’t I struggled to\\nlove him, to love my son when I could not love my husband? But the time\\ncame when I knew that I couldn’t cheat myself any longer, that I was\\nalive, that I was not to blame, that God has made me so that I must\\nlove and live. And now what does he do? If he’d killed me, if he’d\\nkilled him, I could have borne anything, I could have forgiven\\nanything; but, no, he.... How was it I didn’t guess what he would do?\\nHe’s doing just what’s characteristic of his mean character. He’ll keep\\nhimself in the right, while me, in my ruin, he’ll drive still lower to\\nworse ruin yet....”\\n\\nShe recalled the words from the letter. “You can conjecture what awaits\\nyou and your son....” “That’s a threat to take away my child, and most\\nlikely by their stupid law he can. But I know very well why he says it.\\nHe doesn’t believe even in my love for my child, or he despises it\\n(just as he always used to ridicule it). He despises that feeling in\\nme, but he knows that I won’t abandon my child, that I can’t abandon my\\nchild, that there could be no life for me without my child, even with\\nhim whom I love; but that if I abandoned my child and ran away from\\nhim, I should be acting like the most infamous, basest of women. He\\nknows that, and knows that I am incapable of doing that.”\\n\\nShe recalled another sentence in the letter. “Our life must go on as it\\nhas done in the past....” “That life was miserable enough in the old\\ndays; it has been awful of late. What will it be now? And he knows all\\nthat; he knows that I can’t repent that I breathe, that I love; he\\nknows that it can lead to nothing but lying and deceit; but he wants to\\ngo on torturing me. I know him; I know that he’s at home and is happy\\nin deceit, like a fish swimming in the water. No, I won’t give him that\\nhappiness. I’ll break through the spiderweb of lies in which he wants\\nto catch me, come what may. Anything’s better than lying and deceit.”\\n\\n“But how? My God! my God! Was ever a woman so miserable as I am?...”\\n\\n“No; I will break through it, I will break through it!” she cried,\\njumping up and keeping back her tears. And she went to the\\nwriting-table to write him another letter. But at the bottom of her\\nheart she felt that she was not strong enough to break through\\nanything, that she was not strong enough to get out of her old\\nposition, however false and dishonorable it might be.\\n\\nShe sat down at the writing-table, but instead of writing she clasped\\nher hands on the table, and, laying her head on them, burst into tears,\\nwith sobs and heaving breast like a child crying. She was weeping that\\nher dream of her position being made clear and definite had been\\nannihilated forever. She knew beforehand that everything would go on in\\nthe old way, and far worse, indeed, than in the old way. She felt that\\nthe position in the world that she enjoyed, and that had seemed to her\\nof so little consequence in the morning, that this position was\\nprecious to her, that she would not have the strength to exchange it\\nfor the shameful position of a woman who has abandoned husband and\\nchild to join her lover; that however much she might struggle, she\\ncould not be stronger than herself. She would never know freedom in\\nlove, but would remain forever a guilty wife, with the menace of\\ndetection hanging over her at every instant; deceiving her husband for\\nthe sake of a shameful connection with a man living apart and away from\\nher, whose life she could never share. She knew that this was how it\\nwould be, and at the same time it was so awful that she could not even\\nconceive what it would end in. And she cried without restraint, as\\nchildren cry when they are punished.\\n\\nThe sound of the footman’s steps forced her to rouse herself, and,\\nhiding her face from him, she pretended to be writing.\\n\\n“The courier asks if there’s an answer,” the footman announced.\\n\\n“An answer? Yes,” said Anna. “Let him wait. I’ll ring.”\\n\\n“What can I write?” she thought. “What can I decide upon alone? What do\\nI know? What do I want? What is there I care for?” Again she felt that\\nher soul was beginning to be split in two. She was terrified again at\\nthis feeling, and clutched at the first pretext for doing something\\nwhich might divert her thoughts from herself. “I ought to see Alexey”\\n(so she called Vronsky in her thoughts); “no one but he can tell me\\nwhat I ought to do. I’ll go to Betsy’s, perhaps I shall see him there,”\\nshe said to herself, completely forgetting that when she had told him\\nthe day before that she was not going to Princess Tverskaya’s, he had\\nsaid that in that case he should not go either. She went up to the\\ntable, wrote to her husband, “I have received your letter.—A.”; and,\\nringing the bell, gave it to the footman.\\n\\n“We are not going,” she said to Annushka, as she came in.\\n\\n“Not going at all?”\\n\\n“No; don’t unpack till tomorrow, and let the carriage wait. I’m going\\nto the princess’s.”\\n\\n“Which dress am I to get ready 17\\n\\nThe croquet party to which the Princess Tverskaya had invited Anna was\\nto consist of two ladies and their adorers. These two ladies were the\\nchief representatives of a select new Petersburg circle, nicknamed, in\\nimitation of some imitation, _les sept merveilles du monde_. These\\nladies belonged to a circle which, though of the highest society, was\\nutterly hostile to that in which Anna moved. Moreover, Stremov, one of\\nthe most influential people in Petersburg, and the elderly admirer of\\nLiza Merkalova, was Alexey Alexandrovitch’s enemy in the political\\nworld. From all these considerations Anna had not meant to go, and the\\nhints in Princess Tverskaya’s note referred to her refusal. But now\\nAnna was eager to go, in the hope of seeing Vronsky.\\n\\nAnna arrived at Princess Tverskaya’s earlier than the other guests.\\n\\nAt the same moment as she entered, Vronsky’s footman, with\\nside-whiskers combed out like a _Kammerjunker_, went in too. He stopped\\nat the door, and, taking off his cap, let her pass. Anna recognized\\nhim, and only then recalled that Vronsky had told her the day before\\nthat he would not come. Most likely he was sending a note to say so.\\n\\nAs she took off her outer garment in the hall, she heard the footman,\\npronouncing his “_r’s_” even like a _Kammerjunker_, say, “From the\\ncount for the princess,” and hand the note.\\n\\nShe longed to question him as to where his master was. She longed to\\nturn back and send him a letter to come and see her, or to go herself\\nto see him. But neither the first nor the second nor the third course\\nwas possible. Already she heard bells ringing to announce her arrival\\nahead of her, and Princess Tverskaya’s footman was standing at the open\\ndoor waiting for her to go forward into the inner rooms.\\n\\n“The princess is in the garden; they will inform her immediately. Would\\nyou be pleased to walk into the garden?” announced another footman in\\nanother room.\\n\\nThe position of uncertainty, of indecision, was still the same as at\\nhome—worse, in fact, since it was impossible to take any step,\\nimpossible to see Vronsky, and she had to remain here among outsiders,\\nin company so uncongenial to her present mood. But she was wearing a\\ndress that she knew suited her. She was not alone; all around was that\\nluxurious setting of idleness that she was used to, and she felt less\\nwretched than at home. She was not forced to think what she was to do.\\nEverything would be done of itself. On meeting Betsy coming towards her\\nin a white gown that struck her by its elegance, Anna smiled at her\\njust as she always did. Princess Tverskaya was walking with Tushkevitch\\nand a young lady, a relation, who, to the great joy of her parents in\\nthe provinces, was spending the summer with the fashionable princess.\\n\\nThere was probably something unusual about Anna, for Betsy noticed it\\nat once.\\n\\n“I slept badly,” answered Anna, looking intently at the footman who\\ncame to meet them, and, as she supposed, brought Vronsky’s note.\\n\\n“How glad I am you’ve come!” said Betsy. “I’m tired, and was just\\nlonging to have some tea before they come. You might go”—she turned to\\nTushkevitch—“with Masha, and try the croquet ground over there where\\nthey’ve been cutting it. We shall have time to talk a little over tea;\\nwe’ll have a cozy chat, eh?” she said in English to Anna, with a smile,\\npressing the hand with which she held a parasol.\\n\\n“Yes, especially as I can’t stay very long with you. I’m forced to go\\non to old Madame Vrede. I’ve been promising to go for a century,” said\\nAnna, to whom lying, alien as it was to her nature, had become not\\nmerely simple and natural in society, but a positive source of\\nsatisfaction. Why she said this, which she had not thought of a second\\nbefore, she could not have explained. She had said it simply from the\\nreflection that as Vronsky would not be here, she had better secure her\\nown freedom, and try to see him somehow. But why she had spoken of old\\nMadame Vrede, whom she had to go and see, as she had to see many other\\npeople, she could not have explained; and yet, as it afterwards turned\\nout, had she contrived the most cunning devices to meet Vronsky, she\\ncould have thought of nothing better.\\n\\n“No. I’m not going to let you go for anything,” answered Betsy, looking\\nintently into Anna’s face. “Really, if I were not fond of you, I should\\nfeel offended. One would think you were afraid my society would\\ncompromise you. Tea in the little dining-room, please,” she said, half\\nclosing her eyes, as she always did when addressing the footman.\\n\\nTaking the note from him, she read it.\\n\\n“Alexey’s playing us false,” she said in French; “he writes that he\\ncan’t come,” she added in a tone as simple and natural as though it\\ncould never enter her head that Vronsky could mean anything more to\\nAnna than a game of croquet. Anna knew that Betsy knew everything, but,\\nhearing how she spoke of Vronsky before her, she almost felt persuaded\\nfor a minute that she knew nothing.\\n\\n“Ah!” said Anna indifferently, as though not greatly interested in the\\nmatter, and she went on smiling: “How can you or your friends\\ncompromise anyone?”\\n\\nThis playing with words, this hiding of a secret, had a great\\nfascination for Anna, as, indeed, it has for all women. And it was not\\nthe necessity of concealment, not the aim with which the concealment\\nwas contrived, but the process of concealment itself which attracted\\nher.\\n\\n“I can’t be more Catholic than the Pope,” she said. “Stremov and Liza\\nMerkalova, why, they’re the cream of the cream of society. Besides,\\nthey’re received everywhere, and _I_”—she laid special stress on the\\nI—“have never been strict and intolerant. It’s simply that I haven’t\\nthe time.”\\n\\n“No; you don’t care, perhaps, to meet Stremov? Let him and Alexey\\nAlexandrovitch tilt at each other in the committee—that’s no affair of\\nours. But in the world, he’s the most amiable man I know, and a devoted\\ncroquet player. You shall see. And, in spite of his absurd position as\\nLiza’s lovesick swain at his age, you ought to see how he carries off\\nthe absurd position. He’s very nice. Sappho Shtoltz you don’t know? Oh,\\nthat’s a new type, quite new.”\\n\\nBetsy said all this, and, at the same time, from her good-humored,\\nshrewd glance, Anna felt that she partly guessed her plight, and was\\nhatching something for her benefit. They were in the little boudoir.\\n\\n“I must write to Alexey though,” and Betsy sat down to the table,\\nscribbled a few lines, and put the note in an envelope.\\n\\n“I’m telling him to come to dinner. I’ve one lady extra to dinner with\\nme, and no man to take her in. Look what I’ve said, will that persuade\\nhim? Excuse me, I must leave you for a minute. Would you seal it up,\\nplease, and send it off?” she said from the door; “I have to give some\\ndirections.”\\n\\nWithout a moment’s thought, Anna sat down to the table with Betsy’s\\nletter, and, without reading it, wrote below: “It’s essential for me to\\nsee you. Come to the Vrede garden. I shall be there at six o’clock.”\\nShe sealed it up, and, Betsy coming back, in her presence handed the\\nnote to be taken.\\n\\nAt tea, which was brought them on a little tea-table in the cool little\\ndrawing-room, the cozy chat promised by Princess Tverskaya before the\\narrival of her visitors really did come off between the two women. They\\ncriticized the people they were expecting, and the conversation fell\\nupon Liza Merkalova.\\n\\n“She’s very sweet, and I always liked her,” said Anna.\\n\\n“You ought to like her. She raves about you. Yesterday she came up to\\nme after the races and was in despair at not finding you. She says\\nyou’re a real heroine of romance, and that if she were a man she would\\ndo all sorts of mad things for your sake. Stremov says she does that as\\nit is.”\\n\\n“But do tell me, please, I never could make it out,” said Anna, after\\nbeing silent for some time, speaking in a tone that showed she was not\\nasking an idle question, but that what she was asking was of more\\nimportance to her than it should have been; “do tell me, please, what\\nare her relations with Prince Kaluzhsky, Mishka, as he’s called? I’ve\\nmet them so little. What does it mean?”\\n\\nBetsy smiled with her eyes, and looked intently at Anna.\\n\\n“It’s a new manner,” she said. “They’ve all adopted that manner.\\nThey’ve flung their caps over the windmills. But there are ways and\\nways of flinging them.”\\n\\n“Yes, but what are her relations precisely with Kaluzhsky?”\\n\\nBetsy broke into unexpectedly mirthful and irrepressible laughter, a\\nthing which rarely happened with her.\\n\\n“You’re encroaching on Princess Myakaya’s special domain now. That’s\\nthe question of an _enfant terrible_,” and Betsy obviously tried to\\nrestrain herself, but could not, and went off into peals of that\\ninfectious laughter that people laugh who do not laugh often. “You’d\\nbetter ask them,” she brought out, between tears of laughter.\\n\\n“No; you laugh,” said Anna, laughing too in spite of herself, “but I\\nnever could understand it. I can’t understand the husband’s rôle in\\nit.”\\n\\n“The husband? Liza Merkalova’s husband carries her shawl, and is always\\nready to be of use. But anything more than that in reality, no one\\ncares to inquire. You know in decent society one doesn’t talk or think\\neven of certain details of the toilet. That’s how it is with this.”\\n\\n“Will you be at Madame Rolandak’s fête?” asked Anna, to change the\\nconversation.\\n\\n“I don’t think so,” answered Betsy, and, without looking at her friend,\\nshe began filling the little transparent cups with fragrant tea.\\nPutting a cup before Anna, she took out a cigarette, and, fitting it\\ninto a silver holder, she lighted it.\\n\\n“It’s like this, you see: I’m in a fortunate position,” she began,\\nquite serious now, as she took up her cup. “I understand you, and I\\nunderstand Liza. Liza now is one of those naïve natures that, like\\nchildren, don’t know what’s good and what’s bad. Anyway, she didn’t\\ncomprehend it when she was very young. And now she’s aware that the\\nlack of comprehension suits her. Now, perhaps, she doesn’t know on\\npurpose,” said Betsy, with a subtle smile. “But, anyway, it suits her.\\nThe very same thing, don’t you see, may be looked at tragically, and\\nturned into a misery, or it may be looked at simply and even\\nhumorously. Possibly you are inclined to look at things too\\ntragically.”\\n\\n“How I should like to know other people just as I know myself!” said\\nAnna, seriously and dreamily. “Am I worse than other people, or better?\\nI think I’m worse.”\\n\\n“_Enfant terrible, enfant terrible!_” repeated Betsy. “But here they\\nare 18\\n\\nThey heard the sound of steps and a man’s voice, then a woman’s voice\\nand laughter, and immediately thereafter there walked in the expected\\nguests: Sappho Shtoltz, and a young man beaming with excess of health,\\nthe so-called Vaska. It was evident that ample supplies of beefsteak,\\ntruffles, and Burgundy never failed to reach him at the fitting hour.\\nVaska bowed to the two ladies, and glanced at them, but only for one\\nsecond. He walked after Sappho into the drawing-room, and followed her\\nabout as though he were chained to her, keeping his sparkling eyes\\nfixed on her as though he wanted to eat her. Sappho Shtoltz was a\\nblonde beauty with black eyes. She walked with smart little steps in\\nhigh-heeled shoes, and shook hands with the ladies vigorously like a\\nman.\\n\\nAnna had never met this new star of fashion, and was struck by her\\nbeauty, the exaggerated extreme to which her dress was carried, and the\\nboldness of her manners. On her head there was such a superstructure of\\nsoft, golden hair—her own and false mixed—that her head was equal in\\nsize to the elegantly rounded bust, of which so much was exposed in\\nfront. The impulsive abruptness of her movements was such that at every\\nstep the lines of her knees and the upper part of her legs were\\ndistinctly marked under her dress, and the question involuntarily rose\\nto the mind where in the undulating, piled-up mountain of material at\\nthe back the real body of the woman, so small and slender, so naked in\\nfront, and so hidden behind and below, really came to an end.\\n\\nBetsy made haste to introduce her to Anna.\\n\\n“Only fancy, we all but ran over two soldiers,” she began telling them\\nat once, using her eyes, smiling and twitching away her tail, which she\\nflung back at one stroke all on one side. “I drove here with Vaska....\\nAh, to be sure, you don’t know each other.” And mentioning his surname\\nshe introduced the young man, and reddening a little, broke into a\\nringing laugh at her mistake—that is, at her having called him Vaska to\\na stranger. Vaska bowed once more to Anna, but he said nothing to her.\\nHe addressed Sappho: “You’ve lost your bet. We got here first. Pay up,”\\nsaid he, smiling.\\n\\nSappho laughed still more festively.\\n\\n“Not just now,” said she.\\n\\n“Oh, all right, I’ll have it later.”\\n\\n“Very well, very well. Oh, yes.” She turned suddenly to Princess Betsy:\\n“I am a nice person ... I positively forgot it ... I’ve brought you a\\nvisitor. And here he comes.” The unexpected young visitor, whom Sappho\\nhad invited, and whom she had forgotten, was, however, a personage of\\nsuch consequence that, in spite of his youth, both the ladies rose on\\nhis entrance.\\n\\nHe was a new admirer of Sappho’s. He now dogged her footsteps, like\\nVaska.\\n\\nSoon after Prince Kaluzhsky arrived, and Liza Merkalova with Stremov.\\nLiza Merkalova was a thin brunette, with an Oriental, languid type of\\nface, and—as everyone used to say—exquisite enigmatic eyes. The tone of\\nher dark dress (Anna immediately observed and appreciated the fact) was\\nin perfect harmony with her style of beauty. Liza was as soft and\\nenervated as Sappho was smart and abrupt.\\n\\nBut to Anna’s taste Liza was far more attractive. Betsy had said to\\nAnna that she had adopted the pose of an innocent child, but when Anna\\nsaw her, she felt that this was not the truth. She really was both\\ninnocent and corrupt, but a sweet and passive woman. It is true that\\nher tone was the same as Sappho’s; that like Sappho, she had two men,\\none young and one old, tacked onto her, and devouring her with their\\neyes. But there was something in her higher than what surrounded her.\\nThere was in her the glow of the real diamond among glass imitations.\\nThis glow shone out in her exquisite, truly enigmatic eyes. The weary,\\nand at the same time passionate, glance of those eyes, encircled by\\ndark rings, impressed one by its perfect sincerity. Everyone looking\\ninto those eyes fancied he knew her wholly, and knowing her, could not\\nbut love her. At the sight of Anna, her whole face lighted up at once\\nwith a smile of delight.\\n\\n“Ah, how glad I am to see you!” she said, going up to her. “Yesterday\\nat the races all I wanted was to get to you, but you’d gone away. I did\\nso want to see you, yesterday especially. Wasn’t it awful?” she said,\\nlooking at Anna with eyes that seemed to lay bare all her soul.\\n\\n“Yes; I had no idea it would be so thrilling,” said Anna, blushing.\\n\\nThe company got up at this moment to go into the garden.\\n\\n“I’m not going,” said Liza, smiling and settling herself close to Anna.\\n“You won’t go either, will you? Who wants to play croquet?”\\n\\n“Oh, I like it,” said Anna.\\n\\n“There, how do you manage never to be bored by things? It’s delightful\\nto look at you. You’re alive, but I’m bored.”\\n\\n“How can you be bored? Why, you live in the liveliest set in\\nPetersburg,” said Anna.\\n\\n“Possibly the people who are not of our set are even more bored; but\\nwe—I certainly—are not happy, but awfully, awfully bored.”\\n\\nSappho smoking a cigarette went off into the garden with the two young\\nmen. Betsy and Stremov remained at the tea-table.\\n\\n“What, bored!” said Betsy. “Sappho says they did enjoy themselves\\ntremendously at your house last night.”\\n\\n“Ah, how dreary it all was!” said Liza Merkalova. “We all drove back to\\nmy place after the races. And always the same people, always the same.\\nAlways the same thing. We lounged about on sofas all the evening. What\\nis there to enjoy in that? No; do tell me how you manage never to be\\nbored?” she said, addressing Anna again. “One has but to look at you\\nand one sees, here’s a woman who may be happy or unhappy, but isn’t\\nbored. Tell me how you do it?”\\n\\n“I do nothing,” answered Anna, blushing at these searching questions.\\n\\n“That’s the best way,” Stremov put in. Stremov was a man of fifty,\\npartly gray, but still vigorous-looking, very ugly, but with a\\ncharacteristic and intelligent face. Liza Merkalova was his wife’s\\nniece, and he spent all his leisure hours with her. On meeting Anna\\nKarenina, as he was Alexey Alexandrovitch’s enemy in the government, he\\ntried, like a shrewd man and a man of the world, to be particularly\\ncordial with her, the wife of his enemy.\\n\\n“‘Nothing,’” he put in with a subtle smile, “that’s the very best way.\\nI told you long ago,” he said, turning to Liza Merkalova, “that if you\\ndon’t want to be bored, you mustn’t think you’re going to be bored.\\nIt’s just as you mustn’t be afraid of not being able to fall asleep, if\\nyou’re afraid of sleeplessness. That’s just what Anna Arkadyevna has\\njust said.”\\n\\n“I should be very glad if I had said it, for it’s not only clever but\\ntrue,” said Anna, smiling.\\n\\n“No, do tell me why it is one can’t go to sleep, and one can’t help\\nbeing bored?”\\n\\n“To sleep well one ought to work, and to enjoy oneself one ought to\\nwork too.”\\n\\n“What am I to work for when my work is no use to anybody? And I can’t\\nand won’t knowingly make a pretense about it.”\\n\\n“You’re incorrigible,” said Stremov, not looking at her, and he spoke\\nagain to Anna. As he rarely met Anna, he could say nothing but\\ncommonplaces to her, but he said those commonplaces as to when she was\\nreturning to Petersburg, and how fond Countess Lidia Ivanovna was of\\nher, with an expression which suggested that he longed with his whole\\nsoul to please her and show his regard for her and even more than that.\\n\\nTushkevitch came in, announcing that the party were awaiting the other\\nplayers to begin croquet.\\n\\n“No, don’t go away, please don’t,” pleaded Liza Merkalova, hearing that\\nAnna was going. Stremov joined in her entreaties.\\n\\n“It’s too violent a transition,” he said, “to go from such company to\\nold Madame Vrede. And besides, you will only give her a chance for\\ntalking scandal, while here you arouse none but such different feelings\\nof the highest and most opposite kind,” he said to her.\\n\\nAnna pondered for an instant in uncertainty. This shrewd man’s\\nflattering words, the naïve, childlike affection shown her by Liza\\nMerkalova, and all the social atmosphere she was used to,—it was all so\\neasy, and what was in store for her was so difficult, that she was for\\na minute in uncertainty whether to remain, whether to put off a little\\nlonger the painful moment of explanation. But remembering what was in\\nstore for her alone at home, if she did not come to some decision,\\nremembering that gesture—terrible even in memory—when she had clutched\\nher hair in both hands—she said good-bye and went away 19\\n\\nIn spite of Vronsky’s apparently frivolous life in society, he was a\\nman who hated irregularity. In early youth in the Corps of Pages, he\\nhad experienced the humiliation of a refusal, when he had tried, being\\nin difficulties, to borrow money, and since then he had never once put\\nhimself in the same position again.\\n\\nIn order to keep his affairs in some sort of order, he used about five\\ntimes a year (more or less frequently, according to circumstances) to\\nshut himself up alone and put all his affairs into definite shape. This\\nhe used to call his day of reckoning or _faire la lessive_.\\n\\nOn waking up the day after the races, Vronsky put on a white linen\\ncoat, and without shaving or taking his bath, he distributed about the\\ntable moneys, bills, and letters, and set to work. Petritsky, who knew\\nhe was ill-tempered on such occasions, on waking up and seeing his\\ncomrade at the writing-table, quietly dressed and went out without\\ngetting in his way.\\n\\nEvery man who knows to the minutest details all the complexity of the\\nconditions surrounding him, cannot help imagining that the complexity\\nof these conditions, and the difficulty of making them clear, is\\nsomething exceptional and personal, peculiar to himself, and never\\nsupposes that others are surrounded by just as complicated an array of\\npersonal affairs as he is. So indeed it seemed to Vronsky. And not\\nwithout inward pride, and not without reason, he thought that any other\\nman would long ago have been in difficulties, would have been forced to\\nsome dishonorable course, if he had found himself in such a difficult\\nposition. But Vronsky felt that now especially it was essential for him\\nto clear up and define his position if he were to avoid getting into\\ndifficulties.\\n\\nWhat Vronsky attacked first as being the easiest was his pecuniary\\nposition. Writing out on note paper in his minute hand all that he\\nowed, he added up the amount and found that his debts amounted to\\nseventeen thousand and some odd hundreds, which he left out for the\\nsake of clearness. Reckoning up his money and his bank book, he found\\nthat he had left one thousand eight hundred roubles, and nothing coming\\nin before the New Year. Reckoning over again his list of debts, Vronsky\\ncopied it, dividing it into three classes. In the first class he put\\nthe debts which he would have to pay at once, or for which he must in\\nany case have the money ready so that on demand for payment there could\\nnot be a moment’s delay in paying. Such debts amounted to about four\\nthousand: one thousand five hundred for a horse, and two thousand five\\nhundred as surety for a young comrade, Venovsky, who had lost that sum\\nto a cardsharper in Vronsky’s presence. Vronsky had wanted to pay the\\nmoney at the time (he had that amount then), but Venovsky and Yashvin\\nhad insisted that they would pay and not Vronsky, who had not played.\\nThat was so far well, but Vronsky knew that in this dirty business,\\nthough his only share in it was undertaking by word of mouth to be\\nsurety for Venovsky, it was absolutely necessary for him to have the\\ntwo thousand five hundred roubles so as to be able to fling it at the\\nswindler, and have no more words with him. And so for this first and\\nmost important division he must have four thousand roubles. The second\\nclass—eight thousand roubles—consisted of less important debts. These\\nwere principally accounts owing in connection with his race horses, to\\nthe purveyor of oats and hay, the English saddler, and so on. He would\\nhave to pay some two thousand roubles on these debts too, in order to\\nbe quite free from anxiety. The last class of debts—to shops, to\\nhotels, to his tailor—were such as need not be considered. So that he\\nneeded at least six thousand roubles for current expenses, and he only\\nhad one thousand eight hundred. For a man with one hundred thousand\\nroubles of revenue, which was what everyone fixed as Vronsky’s income,\\nsuch debts, one would suppose, could hardly be embarrassing; but the\\nfact was that he was far from having one hundred thousand. His father’s\\nimmense property, which alone yielded a yearly income of two hundred\\nthousand, was left undivided between the brothers. At the time when the\\nelder brother, with a mass of debts, married Princess Varya Tchirkova,\\nthe daughter of a Decembrist without any fortune whatever, Alexey had\\ngiven up to his elder brother almost the whole income from his father’s\\nestate, reserving for himself only twenty-five thousand a year from it.\\nAlexey had said at the time to his brother that that sum would be\\nsufficient for him until he married, which he probably never would do.\\nAnd his brother, who was in command of one of the most expensive\\nregiments, and was only just married, could not decline the gift. His\\nmother, who had her own separate property, had allowed Alexey every\\nyear twenty thousand in addition to the twenty-five thousand he had\\nreserved, and Alexey had spent it all. Of late his mother, incensed\\nwith him on account of his love affair and his leaving Moscow, had\\ngiven up sending him the money. And in consequence of this, Vronsky,\\nwho had been in the habit of living on the scale of forty-five thousand\\na year, having only received twenty thousand that year, found himself\\nnow in difficulties. To get out of these difficulties, he could not\\napply to his mother for money. Her last letter, which he had received\\nthe day before, had particularly exasperated him by the hints in it\\nthat she was quite ready to help him to succeed in the world and in the\\narmy, but not to lead a life which was a scandal to all good society.\\nHis mother’s attempt to buy him stung him to the quick and made him\\nfeel colder than ever to her. But he could not draw back from the\\ngenerous word when it was once uttered, even though he felt now,\\nvaguely foreseeing certain eventualities in his intrigue with Madame\\nKarenina, that this generous word had been spoken thoughtlessly, and\\nthat even though he were not married he might need all the hundred\\nthousand of income. But it was impossible to draw back. He had only to\\nrecall his brother’s wife, to remember how that sweet, delightful Varya\\nsought, at every convenient opportunity, to remind him that she\\nremembered his generosity and appreciated it, to grasp the\\nimpossibility of taking back his gift. It was as impossible as beating\\na woman, stealing, or lying. One thing only could and ought to be done,\\nand Vronsky determined upon it without an instant’s hesitation: to\\nborrow money from a money-lender, ten thousand roubles, a proceeding\\nwhich presented no difficulty, to cut down his expenses generally, and\\nto sell his race horses. Resolving on this, he promptly wrote a note to\\nRolandak, who had more than once sent to him with offers to buy horses\\nfrom him. Then he sent for the Englishman and the money-lender, and\\ndivided what money he had according to the accounts he intended to pay.\\nHaving finished this business, he wrote a cold and cutting answer to\\nhis mother. Then he took out of his notebook three notes of Anna’s,\\nread them again, burned them, and remembering their conversation on the\\nprevious day, he sank into meditation 20\\n\\nVronsky’s life was particularly happy in that he had a code of\\nprinciples, which defined with unfailing certitude what he ought and\\nwhat he ought not to do. This code of principles covered only a very\\nsmall circle of contingencies, but then the principles were never\\ndoubtful, and Vronsky, as he never went outside that circle, had never\\nhad a moment’s hesitation about doing what he ought to do. These\\nprinciples laid down as invariable rules: that one must pay a\\ncardsharper, but need not pay a tailor; that one must never tell a lie\\nto a man, but one may to a woman; that one must never cheat anyone, but\\none may a husband; that one must never pardon an insult, but one may\\ngive one and so on. These principles were possibly not reasonable and\\nnot good, but they were of unfailing certainty, and so long as he\\nadhered to them, Vronsky felt that his heart was at peace and he could\\nhold his head up. Only quite lately in regard to his relations with\\nAnna, Vronsky had begun to feel that his code of principles did not\\nfully cover all possible contingencies, and to foresee in the future\\ndifficulties and perplexities for which he could find no guiding clue.\\n\\nHis present relation to Anna and to her husband was to his mind clear\\nand simple. It was clearly and precisely defined in the code of\\nprinciples by which he was guided.\\n\\nShe was an honorable woman who had bestowed her love upon him, and he\\nloved her, and therefore she was in his eyes a woman who had a right to\\nthe same, or even more, respect than a lawful wife. He would have had\\nhis hand chopped off before he would have allowed himself by a word, by\\na hint, to humiliate her, or even to fall short of the fullest respect\\na woman could look for.\\n\\nHis attitude to society, too, was clear. Everyone might know, might\\nsuspect it, but no one might dare to speak of it. If any did so, he was\\nready to force all who might speak to be silent and to respect the\\nnon-existent honor of the woman he loved.\\n\\nHis attitude to the husband was the clearest of all. From the moment\\nthat Anna loved Vronsky, he had regarded his own right over her as the\\none thing unassailable. Her husband was simply a superfluous and\\ntiresome person. No doubt he was in a pitiable position, but how could\\nthat be helped? The one thing the husband had a right to was to demand\\nsatisfaction with a weapon in his hand, and Vronsky was prepared for\\nthis at any minute.\\n\\nBut of late new inner relations had arisen between him and her, which\\nfrightened Vronsky by their indefiniteness. Only the day before she had\\ntold him that she was with child. And he felt that this fact and what\\nshe expected of him called for something not fully defined in that code\\nof principles by which he had hitherto steered his course in life. And\\nhe had been indeed caught unawares, and at the first moment when she\\nspoke to him of her position, his heart had prompted him to beg her to\\nleave her husband. He had said that, but now thinking things over he\\nsaw clearly that it would be better to manage to avoid that; and at the\\nsame time, as he told himself so, he was afraid whether it was not\\nwrong.\\n\\n“If I told her to leave her husband, that must mean uniting her life\\nwith mine; am I prepared for that? How can I take her away now, when I\\nhave no money? Supposing I could arrange.... But how can I take her\\naway while I’m in the service? If I say that—I ought to be prepared to\\ndo it, that is, I ought to have the money and to retire from the army.”\\n\\nAnd he grew thoughtful. The question whether to retire from the service\\nor not brought him to the other and perhaps the chief though hidden\\ninterest of his life, of which none knew but he.\\n\\nAmbition was the old dream of his youth and childhood, a dream which he\\ndid not confess even to himself, though it was so strong that now this\\npassion was even doing battle with his love. His first steps in the\\nworld and in the service had been successful, but two years before he\\nhad made a great mistake. Anxious to show his independence and to\\nadvance, he had refused a post that had been offered him, hoping that\\nthis refusal would heighten his value; but it turned out that he had\\nbeen too bold, and he was passed over. And having, whether he liked or\\nnot, taken up for himself the position of an independent man, he\\ncarried it off with great tact and good sense, behaving as though he\\nbore no grudge against anyone, did not regard himself as injured in any\\nway, and cared for nothing but to be left alone since he was enjoying\\nhimself. In reality he had ceased to enjoy himself as long ago as the\\nyear before, when he went away to Moscow. He felt that this independent\\nattitude of a man who might have done anything, but cared to do\\nnothing, was already beginning to pall, that many people were beginning\\nto fancy that he was not really capable of anything but being a\\nstraightforward, good-natured fellow. His connection with Madame\\nKarenina, by creating so much sensation and attracting general\\nattention, had given him a fresh distinction which soothed his gnawing\\nworm of ambition for a while, but a week before that worm had been\\nroused up again with fresh force. The friend of his childhood, a man of\\nthe same set, of the same coterie, his comrade in the Corps of Pages,\\nSerpuhovskoy, who had left school with him and had been his rival in\\nclass, in gymnastics, in their scrapes and their dreams of glory, had\\ncome back a few days before from Central Asia, where he had gained two\\nsteps up in rank, and an order rarely bestowed upon generals so young.\\n\\nAs soon as he arrived in Petersburg, people began to talk about him as\\na newly risen star of the first magnitude. A schoolfellow of Vronsky’s\\nand of the same age, he was a general and was expecting a command,\\nwhich might have influence on the course of political events; while\\nVronsky, independent and brilliant and beloved by a charming woman\\nthough he was, was simply a cavalry captain who was readily allowed to\\nbe as independent as ever he liked. “Of course I don’t envy\\nSerpuhovskoy and never could envy him; but his advancement shows me\\nthat one has only to watch one’s opportunity, and the career of a man\\nlike me may be very rapidly made. Three years ago he was in just the\\nsame position as I am. If I retire, I burn my ships. If I remain in the\\narmy, I lose nothing. She said herself she did not wish to change her\\nposition. And with her love I cannot feel envious of Serpuhovskoy.” And\\nslowly twirling his mustaches, he got up from the table and walked\\nabout the room. His eyes shone particularly brightly, and he felt in\\nthat confident, calm, and happy frame of mind which always came after\\nhe had thoroughly faced his position. Everything was straight and\\nclear, just as after former days of reckoning. He shaved, took a cold\\nbath, dressed and went out 21\\n\\n“We’ve come to fetch you. Your _lessive_ lasted a good time today,”\\nsaid Petritsky. “Well, is it over?”\\n\\n“It is over,” answered Vronsky, smiling with his eyes only, and\\ntwirling the tips of his mustaches as circumspectly as though after the\\nperfect order into which his affairs had been brought any over-bold or\\nrapid movement might disturb it.\\n\\n“You’re always just as if you’d come out of a bath after it,” said\\nPetritsky. “I’ve come from Gritsky’s” (that was what they called the\\ncolonel); “they’re expecting you.”\\n\\nVronsky, without answering, looked at his comrade, thinking of\\nsomething else.\\n\\n“Yes; is that music at his place?” he said, listening to the familiar\\nsounds of polkas and waltzes floating across to him. “What’s the fête?”\\n\\n“Serpuhovskoy’s come.”\\n\\n“Aha!” said Vronsky, “why, I didn’t know.”\\n\\nThe smile in his eyes gleamed more brightly than ever.\\n\\nHaving once made up his mind that he was happy in his love, that he\\nsacrificed his ambition to it—having anyway taken up this position,\\nVronsky was incapable of feeling either envious of Serpuhovskoy or hurt\\nwith him for not coming first to him when he came to the regiment.\\nSerpuhovskoy was a good friend, and he was delighted he had come.\\n\\n“Ah, I’m very glad!”\\n\\nThe colonel, Demin, had taken a large country house. The whole party\\nwere in the wide lower balcony. In the courtyard the first objects that\\nmet Vronsky’s eyes were a band of singers in white linen coats,\\nstanding near a barrel of vodka, and the robust, good-humored figure of\\nthe colonel surrounded by officers. He had gone out as far as the first\\nstep of the balcony and was loudly shouting across the band that played\\nOffenbach’s quadrille, waving his arms and giving some orders to a few\\nsoldiers standing on one side. A group of soldiers, a quartermaster,\\nand several subalterns came up to the balcony with Vronsky. The colonel\\nreturned to the table, went out again onto the steps with a tumbler in\\nhis hand, and proposed the toast, “To the health of our former comrade,\\nthe gallant general, Prince Serpuhovskoy. Hurrah!”\\n\\nThe colonel was followed by Serpuhovskoy, who came out onto the steps\\nsmiling, with a glass in his hand.\\n\\n“You always get younger, Bondarenko,” he said to the rosy-checked,\\nsmart-looking quartermaster standing just before him, still youngish\\nlooking though doing his second term of service.\\n\\nIt was three years since Vronsky had seen Serpuhovskoy. He looked more\\nrobust, had let his whiskers grow, but was still the same graceful\\ncreature, whose face and figure were even more striking from their\\nsoftness and nobility than their beauty. The only change Vronsky\\ndetected in him was that subdued, continual radiance of beaming content\\nwhich settles on the faces of men who are successful and are sure of\\nthe recognition of their success by everyone. Vronsky knew that radiant\\nair, and immediately observed it in Serpuhovskoy.\\n\\nAs Serpuhovskoy came down the steps he saw Vronsky. A smile of pleasure\\nlighted up his face. He tossed his head upwards and waved the glass in\\nhis hand, greeting Vronsky, and showing him by the gesture that he\\ncould not come to him before the quartermaster, who stood craning\\nforward his lips ready to be kissed.\\n\\n“Here he is!” shouted the colonel. “Yashvin told me you were in one of\\nyour gloomy tempers.”\\n\\nSerpuhovskoy kissed the moist, fresh lips of the gallant-looking\\nquartermaster, and wiping his mouth with his handkerchief, went up to\\nVronsky.\\n\\n“How glad I am!” he said, squeezing his hand and drawing him on one\\nside.\\n\\n“You look after him,” the colonel shouted to Yashvin, pointing to\\nVronsky; and he went down below to the soldiers.\\n\\n“Why weren’t you at the races yesterday? I expected to see you there,”\\nsaid Vronsky, scrutinizing Serpuhovskoy.\\n\\n“I did go, but late. I beg your pardon,” he added, and he turned to the\\nadjutant: “Please have this divided from me, each man as much as it\\nruns to.” And he hurriedly took notes for three hundred roubles from\\nhis pocketbook, blushing a little.\\n\\n“Vronsky! Have anything to eat or drink?” asked Yashvin. “Hi, something\\nfor the count to eat! Ah, here it is: have a glass!”\\n\\nThe fête at the colonel’s lasted a long while. There was a great deal\\nof drinking. They tossed Serpuhovskoy in the air and caught him again\\nseveral times. Then they did the same to the colonel. Then, to the\\naccompaniment of the band, the colonel himself danced with Petritsky.\\nThen the colonel, who began to show signs of feebleness, sat down on a\\nbench in the courtyard and began demonstrating to Yashvin the\\nsuperiority of Russia over Prussia, especially in cavalry attack, and\\nthere was a lull in the revelry for a moment. Serpuhovskoy went into\\nthe house to the bathroom to wash his hands and found Vronsky there;\\nVronsky was drenching his head with water. He had taken off his coat\\nand put his sunburnt, hairy neck under the tap, and was rubbing it and\\nhis head with his hands. When he had finished, Vronsky sat down by\\nSerpuhovskoy. They both sat down in the bathroom on a lounge, and a\\nconversation began which was very interesting to both of them.\\n\\n“I’ve always been hearing about you through my wife,” said\\nSerpuhovskoy. “I’m glad you’ve been seeing her pretty often.”\\n\\n“She’s friendly with Varya, and they’re the only women in Petersburg I\\ncare about seeing,” answered Vronsky, smiling. He smiled because he\\nforesaw the topic the conversation would turn on, and he was glad of\\nit.\\n\\n“The only ones?” Serpuhovskoy queried, smiling.\\n\\n“Yes; and I heard news of you, but not only through your wife,” said\\nVronsky, checking his hint by a stern expression of face. “I was\\ngreatly delighted to hear of your success, but not a bit surprised. I\\nexpected even more.”\\n\\nSerpuhovskoy smiled. Such an opinion of him was obviously agreeable to\\nhim, and he did not think it necessary to conceal it.\\n\\n“Well, I on the contrary expected less—I’ll own frankly. But I’m glad,\\nvery glad. I’m ambitious; that’s my weakness, and I confess to it.”\\n\\n“Perhaps you wouldn’t confess to it if you hadn’t been successful,”\\nsaid Vronsky.\\n\\n“I don’t suppose so,” said Serpuhovskoy, smiling again. “I won’t say\\nlife wouldn’t be worth living without it, but it would be dull. Of\\ncourse I may be mistaken, but I fancy I have a certain capacity for the\\nline I’ve chosen, and that power of any sort in my hands, if it is to\\nbe, will be better than in the hands of a good many people I know,”\\nsaid Serpuhovskoy, with beaming consciousness of success; “and so the\\nnearer I get to it, the better pleased I am.”\\n\\n“Perhaps that is true for you, but not for everyone. I used to think so\\ntoo, but here I live and think life worth living not only for that.”\\n\\n“There it’s out! here it comes!” said Serpuhovskoy, laughing. “Ever\\nsince I heard about you, about your refusal, I began.... Of course, I\\napproved of what you did. But there are ways of doing everything. And I\\nthink your action was good in itself, but you didn’t do it quite in the\\nway you ought to have done.”\\n\\n“What’s done can’t be undone, and you know I never go back on what I’ve\\ndone. And besides, I’m very well off.”\\n\\n“Very well off—for the time. But you’re not satisfied with that. I\\nwouldn’t say this to your brother. He’s a nice child, like our host\\nhere. There he goes!” he added, listening to the roar of “hurrah!”—“and\\nhe’s happy, but that does not satisfy you.”\\n\\n“I didn’t say it did satisfy me.”\\n\\n“Yes, but that’s not the only thing. Such men as you are wanted.”\\n\\n“By whom?”\\n\\n“By whom? By society, by Russia. Russia needs men; she needs a party,\\nor else everything goes and will go to the dogs.”\\n\\n“How do you mean? Bertenev’s party against the Russian communists?”\\n\\n“No,” said Serpuhovskoy, frowning with vexation at being suspected of\\nsuch an absurdity. “_Tout ça est une blague_. That’s always been and\\nalways will be. There are no communists. But intriguing people have to\\ninvent a noxious, dangerous party. It’s an old trick. No, what’s wanted\\nis a powerful party of independent men like you and me.”\\n\\n“But why so?” Vronsky mentioned a few men who were in power. “Why\\naren’t they independent men?”\\n\\n“Simply because they have not, or have not had from birth, an\\nindependent fortune; they’ve not had a name, they’ve not been close to\\nthe sun and center as we have. They can be bought either by money or by\\nfavor. And they have to find a support for themselves in inventing a\\npolicy. And they bring forward some notion, some policy that they don’t\\nbelieve in, that does harm; and the whole policy is really only a means\\nto a government house and so much income. _Cela n’est pas plus fin que\\nça_, when you get a peep at their cards. I may be inferior to them,\\nstupider perhaps, though I don’t see why I should be inferior to them.\\nBut you and I have one important advantage over them for certain, in\\nbeing more difficult to buy. And such men are more needed than ever.”\\n\\nVronsky listened attentively, but he was not so much interested by the\\nmeaning of the words as by the attitude of Serpuhovskoy who was already\\ncontemplating a struggle with the existing powers, and already had his\\nlikes and dislikes in that higher world, while his own interest in the\\ngoverning world did not go beyond the interests of his regiment.\\nVronsky felt, too, how powerful Serpuhovskoy might become through his\\nunmistakable faculty for thinking things out and for taking things in,\\nthrough his intelligence and gift of words, so rarely met with in the\\nworld in which he moved. And, ashamed as he was of the feeling, he felt\\nenvious.\\n\\n“Still I haven’t the one thing of most importance for that,” he\\nanswered; “I haven’t the desire for power. I had it once, but it’s\\ngone.”\\n\\n“Excuse me, that’s not true,” said Serpuhovskoy, smiling.\\n\\n“Yes, it is true, it is true ... now!” Vronsky added, to be truthful.\\n\\n“Yes, it’s true now, that’s another thing; but that _now_ won’t last\\nforever.”\\n\\n“Perhaps,” answered Vronsky.\\n\\n“You say _perhaps_,” Serpuhovskoy went on, as though guessing his\\nthoughts, “but I say _for certain_. And that’s what I wanted to see you\\nfor. Your action was just what it should have been. I see that, but you\\nought not to keep it up. I only ask you to give me _carte blanche_. I’m\\nnot going to offer you my protection ... though, indeed, why shouldn’t\\nI protect you?—you’ve protected me often enough! I should hope our\\nfriendship rises above all that sort of thing. Yes,” he said, smiling\\nto him as tenderly as a woman, “give me _carte blanche_, retire from\\nthe regiment, and I’ll draw you upwards imperceptibly.”\\n\\n“But you must understand that I want nothing,” said Vronsky, “except\\nthat all should be as it is.”\\n\\nSerpuhovskoy got up and stood facing him.\\n\\n“You say that all should be as it is. I understand what that means. But\\nlisten: we’re the same age, you’ve known a greater number of women\\nperhaps than I have.” Serpohovskoy’s smile and gestures told Vronsky\\nthat he mustn’t be afraid, that he would be tender and careful in\\ntouching the sore place. “But I’m married, and believe me, in getting\\nto know thoroughly one’s wife, if one loves her, as someone has said,\\none gets to know all women better than if one knew thousands of them.”\\n\\n“We’re coming directly!” Vronsky shouted to an officer, who looked into\\nthe room and called them to the colonel.\\n\\nVronsky was longing now to hear to the end and know what Serpuhovskey\\nwould say to him.\\n\\n“And here’s my opinion for you. Women are the chief stumbling block in\\na man’s career. It’s hard to love a woman and do anything. There’s only\\none way of having love conveniently without its being a\\nhindrance—that’s marriage. How, how am I to tell you what I mean?” said\\nSerpuhovskoy, who liked similes. “Wait a minute, wait a minute! Yes,\\njust as you can only carry a _fardeau_ and do something with your\\nhands, when the _fardeau_ is tied on your back, and that’s marriage.\\nAnd that’s what I felt when I was married. My hands were suddenly set\\nfree. But to drag that _fardeau_ about with you without marriage, your\\nhands will always be so full that you can do nothing. Look at Mazankov,\\nat Krupov. They’ve ruined their careers for the sake of women.”\\n\\n“What women!” said Vronsky, recalling the Frenchwoman and the actress\\nwith whom the two men he had mentioned were connected.\\n\\n“The firmer the woman’s footing in society, the worse it is. That’s\\nmuch the same as—not merely carrying the _fardeau_ in your arms—but\\ntearing it away from someone else.”\\n\\n“You have never loved,” Vronsky said softly, looking straight before\\nhim and thinking of Anna.\\n\\n“Perhaps. But you remember what I’ve said to you. And another thing,\\nwomen are all more materialistic than men. We make something immense\\nout of love, but they are always _terre-à-terre_.”\\n\\n“Directly, directly!” he cried to a footman who came in. But the\\nfootman had not come to call them again, as he supposed. The footman\\nbrought Vronsky a note.\\n\\n“A man brought it from Princess Tverskaya.”\\n\\nVronsky opened the letter, and flushed crimson.\\n\\n“My head’s begun to ache; I’m going home,” he said to Serpuhovskoy.\\n\\n“Oh, good-bye then. You give me _carte blanche!_”\\n\\n“We’ll talk about it later on; I’ll look you up in Petersburg 22\\n\\nIt was six o’clock already, and so, in order to be there quickly, and\\nat the same time not to drive with his own horses, known to everyone,\\nVronsky got into Yashvin’s hired fly, and told the driver to drive as\\nquickly as possible. It was a roomy, old-fashioned fly, with seats for\\nfour. He sat in one corner, stretched his legs out on the front seat,\\nand sank into meditation.\\n\\nA vague sense of the order into which his affairs had been brought, a\\nvague recollection of the friendliness and flattery of Serpuhovskoy,\\nwho had considered him a man that was needed, and most of all, the\\nanticipation of the interview before him—all blended into a general,\\njoyous sense of life. This feeling was so strong that he could not help\\nsmiling. He dropped his legs, crossed one leg over the other knee, and\\ntaking it in his hand, felt the springy muscle of the calf, where it\\nhad been grazed the day before by his fall, and leaning back he drew\\nseveral deep breaths.\\n\\n“I’m happy, very happy!” he said to himself. He had often before had\\nthis sense of physical joy in his own body, but he had never felt so\\nfond of himself, of his own body, as at that moment. He enjoyed the\\nslight ache in his strong leg, he enjoyed the muscular sensation of\\nmovement in his chest as he breathed. The bright, cold August day,\\nwhich had made Anna feel so hopeless, seemed to him keenly stimulating,\\nand refreshed his face and neck that still tingled from the cold water.\\nThe scent of brilliantine on his whiskers struck him as particularly\\npleasant in the fresh air. Everything he saw from the carriage window,\\neverything in that cold pure air, in the pale light of the sunset, was\\nas fresh, and gay, and strong as he was himself: the roofs of the\\nhouses shining in the rays of the setting sun, the sharp outlines of\\nfences and angles of buildings, the figures of passers-by, the\\ncarriages that met him now and then, the motionless green of the trees\\nand grass, the fields with evenly drawn furrows of potatoes, and the\\nslanting shadows that fell from the houses, and trees, and bushes, and\\neven from the rows of potatoes—everything was bright like a pretty\\nlandscape just finished and freshly varnished.\\n\\n“Get on, get on!” he said to the driver, putting his head out of the\\nwindow, and pulling a three-rouble note out of his pocket he handed it\\nto the man as he looked round. The driver’s hand fumbled with something\\nat the lamp, the whip cracked, and the carriage rolled rapidly along\\nthe smooth highroad.\\n\\n“I want nothing, nothing but this happiness,” he thought, staring at\\nthe bone button of the bell in the space between the windows, and\\npicturing to himself Anna just as he had seen her last time. “And as I\\ngo on, I love her more and more. Here’s the garden of the Vrede Villa.\\nWhereabouts will she be? Where? How? Why did she fix on this place to\\nmeet me, and why does she write in Betsy’s letter?” he thought,\\nwondering now for the first time at it. But there was now no time for\\nwonder. He called to the driver to stop before reaching the avenue, and\\nopening the door, jumped out of the carriage as it was moving, and went\\ninto the avenue that led up to the house. There was no one in the\\navenue; but looking round to the right he caught sight of her. Her face\\nwas hidden by a veil, but he drank in with glad eyes the special\\nmovement in walking, peculiar to her alone, the slope of the shoulders,\\nand the setting of the head, and at once a sort of electric shock ran\\nall over him. With fresh force, he felt conscious of himself from the\\nspringy motions of his legs to the movements of his lungs as he\\nbreathed, and something set his lips twitching.\\n\\nJoining him, she pressed his hand tightly.\\n\\n“You’re not angry that I sent for you? I absolutely had to see you,”\\nshe said; and the serious and set line of her lips, which he saw under\\nthe veil, transformed his mood at once.\\n\\n“I angry! But how have you come, where from?”\\n\\n“Never mind,” she said, laying her hand on his, “come along, I must\\ntalk to you.”\\n\\nHe saw that something had happened, and that the interview would not be\\na joyous one. In her presence he had no will of his own: without\\nknowing the grounds of her distress, he already felt the same distress\\nunconsciously passing over him.\\n\\n“What is it? what?” he asked her, squeezing her hand with his elbow,\\nand trying to read her thoughts in her face.\\n\\nShe walked on a few steps in silence, gathering up her courage; then\\nsuddenly she stopped.\\n\\n“I did not tell you yesterday,” she began, breathing quickly and\\npainfully, “that coming home with Alexey Alexandrovitch I told him\\neverything ... told him I could not be his wife, that ... and told him\\neverything.”\\n\\nHe heard her, unconsciously bending his whole figure down to her as\\nthough hoping in this way to soften the hardness of her position for\\nher. But directly she had said this he suddenly drew himself up, and a\\nproud and hard expression came over his face.\\n\\n“Yes, yes, that’s better, a thousand times better! I know how painful\\nit was,” he said. But she was not listening to his words, she was\\nreading his thoughts from the expression of his face. She could not\\nguess that that expression arose from the first idea that presented\\nitself to Vronsky—that a duel was now inevitable. The idea of a duel\\nhad never crossed her mind, and so she put a different interpretation\\non this passing expression of hardness.\\n\\nWhen she got her husband’s letter, she knew then at the bottom of her\\nheart that everything would go on in the old way, that she would not\\nhave the strength of will to forego her position, to abandon her son,\\nand to join her lover. The morning spent at Princess Tverskaya’s had\\nconfirmed her still more in this. But this interview was still of the\\nutmost gravity for her. She hoped that this interview would transform\\nher position, and save her. If on hearing this news he were to say to\\nher resolutely, passionately, without an instant’s wavering: “Throw up\\neverything and come with me!” she would give up her son and go away\\nwith him. But this news had not produced what she had expected in him;\\nhe simply seemed as though he were resenting some affront.\\n\\n“It was not in the least painful to me. It happened of itself,” she\\nsaid irritably; “and see....” she pulled her husband’s letter out of\\nher glove.\\n\\n“I understand, I understand,” he interrupted her, taking the letter,\\nbut not reading it, and trying to soothe her. “The one thing I longed\\nfor, the one thing I prayed for, was to cut short this position, so as\\nto devote my life to your happiness.”\\n\\n“Why do you tell me that?” she said. “Do you suppose I can doubt it? If\\nI doubted....”\\n\\n“Who’s that coming?” said Vronsky suddenly, pointing to two ladies\\nwalking towards them. “Perhaps they know us!” and he hurriedly turned\\noff, drawing her after him into a side path.\\n\\n“Oh, I don’t care!” she said. Her lips were quivering. And he fancied\\nthat her eyes looked with strange fury at him from under the veil. “I\\ntell you that’s not the point—I can’t doubt that; but see what he\\nwrites to me. Read it.” She stood still again.\\n\\nAgain, just as at the first moment of hearing of her rupture with her\\nhusband, Vronsky, on reading the letter, was unconsciously carried away\\nby the natural sensation aroused in him by his own relation to the\\nbetrayed husband. Now while he held his letter in his hands, he could\\nnot help picturing the challenge, which he would most likely find at\\nhome today or tomorrow, and the duel itself, in which, with the same\\ncold and haughty expression that his face was assuming at this moment\\nhe would await the injured husband’s shot, after having himself fired\\ninto the air. And at that instant there flashed across his mind the\\nthought of what Serpuhovskoy had just said to him, and what he had\\nhimself been thinking in the morning—that it was better not to bind\\nhimself—and he knew that this thought he could not tell her.\\n\\nHaving read the letter, he raised his eyes to her, and there was no\\ndetermination in them. She saw at once that he had been thinking about\\nit before by himself. She knew that whatever he might say to her, he\\nwould not say all he thought. And she knew that her last hope had\\nfailed her. This was not what she had been reckoning on.\\n\\n“You see the sort of man he is,” she said, with a shaking voice;\\n“he....”\\n\\n“Forgive me, but I rejoice at it,” Vronsky interrupted. “For God’s\\nsake, let me finish!” he added, his eyes imploring her to give him time\\nto explain his words. “I rejoice, because things cannot, cannot\\npossibly remain as he supposes.”\\n\\n“Why can’t they?” Anna said, restraining her tears, and obviously\\nattaching no sort of consequence to what he said. She felt that her\\nfate was sealed.\\n\\nVronsky meant that after the duel—inevitable, he thought—things could\\nnot go on as before, but he said something different.\\n\\n“It can’t go on. I hope that now you will leave him. I hope”—he was\\nconfused, and reddened—“that you will let me arrange and plan our life.\\nTomorrow....” he was beginning.\\n\\nShe did not let him go on.\\n\\n“But my child!” she shrieked. “You see what he writes! I should have to\\nleave him, and I can’t and won’t do that.”\\n\\n“But, for God’s sake, which is better?—leave your child, or keep up\\nthis degrading position?”\\n\\n“To whom is it degrading?”\\n\\n“To all, and most of all to you.”\\n\\n“You say degrading ... don’t say that. Those words have no meaning for\\nme,” she said in a shaking voice. She did not want him now to say what\\nwas untrue. She had nothing left her but his love, and she wanted to\\nlove him. “Don’t you understand that from the day I loved you\\neverything has changed for me? For me there is one thing, and one thing\\nonly—your love. If that’s mine, I feel so exalted, so strong, that\\nnothing can be humiliating to me. I am proud of my position, because\\n... proud of being ... proud....” She could not say what she was proud\\nof. Tears of shame and despair choked her utterance. She stood still\\nand sobbed.\\n\\nHe felt, too, something swelling in his throat and twitching in his\\nnose, and for the first time in his life he felt on the point of\\nweeping. He could not have said exactly what it was touched him so. He\\nfelt sorry for her, and he felt he could not help her, and with that he\\nknew that he was to blame for her wretchedness, and that he had done\\nsomething wrong.\\n\\n“Is not a divorce possible?” he said feebly. She shook her head, not\\nanswering. “Couldn’t you take your son, and still leave him?”\\n\\n“Yes; but it all depends on him. Now I must go to him,” she said\\nshortly. Her presentiment that all would again go on in the old way had\\nnot deceived her.\\n\\n“On Tuesday I shall be in Petersburg, and everything can be settled.”\\n\\n“Yes,” she said. “But don’t let us talk any more of it.”\\n\\nAnna’s carriage, which she had sent away, and ordered to come back to\\nthe little gate of the Vrede garden, drove up. Anna said good-bye to\\nVronsky, and drove home 23\\n\\nOn Monday there was the usual sitting of the Commission of the 2nd of\\nJune. Alexey Alexandrovitch walked into the hall where the sitting was\\nheld, greeted the members and the president, as usual, and sat down in\\nhis place, putting his hand on the papers laid ready before him. Among\\nthese papers lay the necessary evidence and a rough outline of the\\nspeech he intended to make. But he did not really need these documents.\\nHe remembered every point, and did not think it necessary to go over in\\nhis memory what he would say. He knew that when the time came, and when\\nhe saw his enemy facing him, and studiously endeavoring to assume an\\nexpression of indifference, his speech would flow of itself better than\\nhe could prepare it now. He felt that the import of his speech was of\\nsuch magnitude that every word of it would have weight. Meantime, as he\\nlistened to the usual report, he had the most innocent and inoffensive\\nair. No one, looking at his white hands, with their swollen veins and\\nlong fingers, so softly stroking the edges of the white paper that lay\\nbefore him, and at the air of weariness with which his head drooped on\\none side, would have suspected that in a few minutes a torrent of words\\nwould flow from his lips that would arouse a fearful storm, set the\\nmembers shouting and attacking one another, and force the president to\\ncall for order. When the report was over, Alexey Alexandrovitch\\nannounced in his subdued, delicate voice that he had several points to\\nbring before the meeting in regard to the Commission for the\\nReorganization of the Native Tribes. All attention was turned upon him.\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch cleared his throat, and not looking at his\\nopponent, but selecting, as he always did while he was delivering his\\nspeeches, the first person sitting opposite him, an inoffensive little\\nold man, who never had an opinion of any sort in the Commission, began\\nto expound his views. When he reached the point about the fundamental\\nand radical law, his opponent jumped up and began to protest. Stremov,\\nwho was also a member of the Commission, and also stung to the quick,\\nbegan defending himself, and altogether a stormy sitting followed; but\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch triumphed, and his motion was carried, three new\\ncommissions were appointed, and the next day in a certain Petersburg\\ncircle nothing else was talked of but this sitting. Alexey\\nAlexandrovitch’s success had been even greater than he had anticipated.\\n\\nNext morning, Tuesday, Alexey Alexandrovitch, on waking up, recollected\\nwith pleasure his triumph of the previous day, and he could not help\\nsmiling, though he tried to appear indifferent, when the chief\\nsecretary of his department, anxious to flatter him, informed him of\\nthe rumors that had reached him concerning what had happened in the\\nCommission.\\n\\nAbsorbed in business with the chief secretary, Alexey Alexandrovitch\\nhad completely forgotten that it was Tuesday, the day fixed by him for\\nthe return of Anna Arkadyevna, and he was surprised and received a\\nshock of annoyance when a servant came in to inform him of her arrival.\\n\\nAnna had arrived in Petersburg early in the morning; the carriage had\\nbeen sent to meet her in accordance with her telegram, and so Alexey\\nAlexandrovitch might have known of her arrival. But when she arrived,\\nhe did not meet her. She was told that he had not yet gone out, but was\\nbusy with his secretary. She sent word to her husband that she had\\ncome, went to her own room, and occupied herself in sorting out her\\nthings, expecting he would come to her. But an hour passed; he did not\\ncome. She went into the dining-room on the pretext of giving some\\ndirections, and spoke loudly on purpose, expecting him to come out\\nthere; but he did not come, though she heard him go to the door of his\\nstudy as he parted from the chief secretary. She knew that he usually\\nwent out quickly to his office, and she wanted to see him before that,\\nso that their attitude to one another might be defined.\\n\\nShe walked across the drawing-room and went resolutely to him. When she\\nwent into his study he was in official uniform, obviously ready to go\\nout, sitting at a little table on which he rested his elbows, looking\\ndejectedly before him. She saw him before he saw her, and she saw that\\nhe was thinking of her.\\n\\nOn seeing her, he would have risen, but changed his mind, then his face\\nflushed hotly—a thing Anna had never seen before, and he got up quickly\\nand went to meet her, looking not at her eyes, but above them at her\\nforehead and hair. He went up to her, took her by the hand, and asked\\nher to sit down.\\n\\n“I am very glad you have come,” he said, sitting down beside her, and\\nobviously wishing to say something, he stuttered. Several times he\\ntried to begin to speak, but stopped. In spite of the fact that,\\npreparing herself for meeting him, she had schooled herself to despise\\nand reproach him, she did not know what to say to him, and she felt\\nsorry for him. And so the silence lasted for some time. “Is Seryozha\\nquite well?” he said, and not waiting for an answer, he added: “I\\nshan’t be dining at home today, and I have got to go out directly.”\\n\\n“I had thought of going to Moscow,” she said.\\n\\n“No, you did quite, quite right to come,” he said, and was silent\\nagain.\\n\\nSeeing that he was powerless to begin the conversation, she began\\nherself.\\n\\n“Alexey Alexandrovitch,” she said, looking at him and not dropping her\\neyes under his persistent gaze at her hair, “I’m a guilty woman, I’m a\\nbad woman, but I am the same as I was, as I told you then, and I have\\ncome to tell you that I can change nothing.”\\n\\n“I have asked you no question about that,” he said, all at once,\\nresolutely and with hatred looking her straight in the face; “that was\\nas I had supposed.” Under the influence of anger he apparently regained\\ncomplete possession of all his faculties. “But as I told you then, and\\nhave written to you,” he said in a thin, shrill voice, “I repeat now,\\nthat I am not bound to know this. I ignore it. Not all wives are so\\nkind as you, to be in such a hurry to communicate such agreeable news\\nto their husbands.” He laid special emphasis on the word “agreeable.”\\n“I shall ignore it so long as the world knows nothing of it, so long as\\nmy name is not disgraced. And so I simply inform you that our relations\\nmust be just as they have always been, and that only in the event of\\nyour compromising me I shall be obliged to take steps to secure my\\nhonor.”\\n\\n“But our relations cannot be the same as always,” Anna began in a timid\\nvoice, looking at him with dismay.\\n\\nWhen she saw once more those composed gestures, heard that shrill,\\nchildish, and sarcastic voice, her aversion for him extinguished her\\npity for him, and she felt only afraid, but at all costs she wanted to\\nmake clear her position.\\n\\n“I cannot be your wife while I....” she began.\\n\\nHe laughed a cold and malignant laugh.\\n\\n“The manner of life you have chosen is reflected, I suppose, in your\\nideas. I have too much respect or contempt, or both ... I respect your\\npast and despise your present ... that I was far from the\\ninterpretation you put on my words.”\\n\\nAnna sighed and bowed her head.\\n\\n“Though indeed I fail to comprehend how, with the independence you\\nshow,” he went on, getting hot, “—announcing your infidelity to your\\nhusband and seeing nothing reprehensible in it, apparently—you can see\\nanything reprehensible in performing a wife’s duties in relation to\\nyour husband.”\\n\\n“Alexey Alexandrovitch! What is it you want of me?”\\n\\n“I want you not to meet that man here, and to conduct yourself so that\\nneither the world nor the servants can reproach you ... not to see him.\\nThat’s not much, I think. And in return you will enjoy all the\\nprivileges of a faithful wife without fulfilling her duties. That’s all\\nI have to say to you. Now it’s time for me to go. I’m not dining at\\nhome.” He got up and moved towards the door.\\n\\nAnna got up too. Bowing in silence, he let her pass before him 24\\n\\nThe night spent by Levin on the haycock did not pass without result for\\nhim. The way in which he had been managing his land revolted him and\\nhad lost all attraction for him. In spite of the magnificent harvest,\\nnever had there been, or, at least, never it seemed to him, had there\\nbeen so many hindrances and so many quarrels between him and the\\npeasants as that year, and the origin of these failures and this\\nhostility was now perfectly comprehensible to him. The delight he had\\nexperienced in the work itself, and the consequent greater intimacy\\nwith the peasants, the envy he felt of them, of their life, the desire\\nto adopt that life, which had been to him that night not a dream but an\\nintention, the execution of which he had thought out in detail—all this\\nhad so transformed his view of the farming of the land as he had\\nmanaged it, that he could not take his former interest in it, and could\\nnot help seeing that unpleasant relation between him and the workpeople\\nwhich was the foundation of it all. The herd of improved cows such as\\nPava, the whole land ploughed over and enriched, the nine level fields\\nsurrounded with hedges, the two hundred and forty acres heavily\\nmanured, the seed sown in drills, and all the rest of it—it was all\\nsplendid if only the work had been done for themselves, or for\\nthemselves and comrades—people in sympathy with them. But he saw\\nclearly now (his work on a book of agriculture, in which the chief\\nelement in husbandry was to have been the laborer, greatly assisted him\\nin this) that the sort of farming he was carrying on was nothing but a\\ncruel and stubborn struggle between him and the laborers, in which\\nthere was on one side—his side—a continual intense effort to change\\neverything to a pattern he considered better; on the other side, the\\nnatural order of things. And in this struggle he saw that with immense\\nexpenditure of force on his side, and with no effort or even intention\\non the other side, all that was attained was that the work did not go\\nto the liking of either side, and that splendid tools, splendid cattle\\nand land were spoiled with no good to anyone. Worst of all, the energy\\nexpended on this work was not simply wasted. He could not help feeling\\nnow, since the meaning of this system had become clear to him, that the\\naim of his energy was a most unworthy one. In reality, what was the\\nstruggle about? He was struggling for every farthing of his share (and\\nhe could not help it, for he had only to relax his efforts, and he\\nwould not have had the money to pay his laborers’ wages), while they\\nwere only struggling to be able to do their work easily and agreeably,\\nthat is to say, as they were used to doing it. It was for his interests\\nthat every laborer should work as hard as possible, and that while\\ndoing so he should keep his wits about him, so as to try not to break\\nthe winnowing machines, the horse rakes, the thrashing machines, that\\nhe should attend to what he was doing. What the laborer wanted was to\\nwork as pleasantly as possible, with rests, and above all, carelessly\\nand heedlessly, without thinking. That summer Levin saw this at every\\nstep. He sent the men to mow some clover for hay, picking out the worst\\npatches where the clover was overgrown with grass and weeds and of no\\nuse for seed; again and again they mowed the best acres of clover,\\njustifying themselves by the pretense that the bailiff had told them\\nto, and trying to pacify him with the assurance that it would be\\nsplendid hay; but he knew that it was owing to those acres being so\\nmuch easier to mow. He sent out a hay machine for pitching the hay—it\\nwas broken at the first row because it was dull work for a peasant to\\nsit on the seat in front with the great wings waving above him. And he\\nwas told, “Don’t trouble, your honor, sure, the womenfolks will pitch\\nit quick enough.” The ploughs were practically useless, because it\\nnever occurred to the laborer to raise the share when he turned the\\nplough, and forcing it round, he strained the horses and tore up the\\nground, and Levin was begged not to mind about it. The horses were\\nallowed to stray into the wheat because not a single laborer would\\nconsent to be night-watchman, and in spite of orders to the contrary,\\nthe laborers insisted on taking turns for night duty, and Ivan, after\\nworking all day long, fell asleep, and was very penitent for his fault,\\nsaying, “Do what you will to me, your honor.”\\n\\nThey killed three of the best calves by letting them into the clover\\naftermath without care as to their drinking, and nothing would make the\\nmen believe that they had been blown out by the clover, but they told\\nhim, by way of consolation, that one of his neighbors had lost a\\nhundred and twelve head of cattle in three days. All this happened, not\\nbecause anyone felt ill-will to Levin or his farm; on the contrary, he\\nknew that they liked him, thought him a simple gentleman (their highest\\npraise); but it happened simply because all they wanted was to work\\nmerrily and carelessly, and his interests were not only remote and\\nincomprehensible to them, but fatally opposed to their most just\\nclaims. Long before, Levin had felt dissatisfaction with his own\\nposition in regard to the land. He saw where his boat leaked, but he\\ndid not look for the leak, perhaps purposely deceiving himself.\\n(Nothing would be left him if he lost faith in it.) But now he could\\ndeceive himself no longer. The farming of the land, as he was managing\\nit, had become not merely unattractive but revolting to him, and he\\ncould take no further interest in it.\\n\\nTo this now was joined the presence, only twenty-five miles off, of\\nKitty Shtcherbatskaya, whom he longed to see and could not see. Darya\\nAlexandrovna Oblonskaya had invited him, when he was over there, to\\ncome; to come with the object of renewing his offer to her sister, who\\nwould, so she gave him to understand, accept him now. Levin himself had\\nfelt on seeing Kitty Shtcherbatskaya that he had never ceased to love\\nher; but he could not go over to the Oblonskys’, knowing she was there.\\nThe fact that he had made her an offer, and she had refused him, had\\nplaced an insuperable barrier between her and him. “I can’t ask her to\\nbe my wife merely because she can’t be the wife of the man she wanted\\nto marry,” he said to himself. The thought of this made him cold and\\nhostile to her. “I should not be able to speak to her without a feeling\\nof reproach; I could not look at her without resentment; and she will\\nonly hate me all the more, as she’s bound to. And besides, how can I\\nnow, after what Darya Alexandrovna told me, go to see them? Can I help\\nshowing that I know what she told me? And me to go magnanimously to\\nforgive her, and have pity on her! Me go through a performance before\\nher of forgiving, and deigning to bestow my love on her!... What\\ninduced Darya Alexandrovna to tell me that? By chance I might have seen\\nher, then everything would have happened of itself; but, as it is, it’s\\nout of the question, out of the question!”\\n\\nDarya Alexandrovna sent him a letter, asking him for a side-saddle for\\nKitty’s use. “I’m told you have a side-saddle,” she wrote to him; “I\\nhope you will bring it over yourself.”\\n\\nThis was more than he could stand. How could a woman of any\\nintelligence, of any delicacy, put her sister in such a humiliating\\nposition! He wrote ten notes, and tore them all up, and sent the saddle\\nwithout any reply. To write that he would go was impossible, because he\\ncould not go; to write that he could not come because something\\nprevented him, or that he would be away, that was still worse. He sent\\nthe saddle without an answer, and with a sense of having done something\\nshameful; he handed over all the now revolting business of the estate\\nto the bailiff, and set off next day to a remote district to see his\\nfriend Sviazhsky, who had splendid marshes for grouse in his\\nneighborhood, and had lately written to ask him to keep a long-standing\\npromise to stay with him. The grouse-marsh, in the Surovsky district,\\nhad long tempted Levin, but he had continually put off this visit on\\naccount of his work on the estate. Now he was glad to get away from the\\nneighborhood of the Shtcherbatskys, and still more from his farm work,\\nespecially on a shooting expedition, which always in trouble served as\\nthe best consolation 25\\n\\nIn the Surovsky district there was no railway nor service of post\\nhorses, and Levin drove there with his own horses in his big,\\nold-fashioned carriage.\\n\\nHe stopped halfway at a well-to-do peasant’s to feed his horses. A\\nbald, well-preserved old man, with a broad, red beard, gray on his\\ncheeks, opened the gate, squeezing against the gatepost to let the\\nthree horses pass. Directing the coachman to a place under the shed in\\nthe big, clean, tidy yard, with charred, old-fashioned ploughs in it,\\nthe old man asked Levin to come into the parlor. A cleanly dressed\\nyoung woman, with clogs on her bare feet, was scrubbing the floor in\\nthe new outer room. She was frightened of the dog, that ran in after\\nLevin, and uttered a shriek, but began laughing at her own fright at\\nonce when she was told the dog would not hurt her. Pointing Levin with\\nher bare arm to the door into the parlor, she bent down again, hiding\\nher handsome face, and went on scrubbing.\\n\\n“Would you like the samovar?” she asked.\\n\\n“Yes, please.”\\n\\nThe parlor was a big room, with a Dutch stove, and a screen dividing it\\ninto two. Under the holy pictures stood a table painted in patterns, a\\nbench, and two chairs. Near the entrance was a dresser full of\\ncrockery. The shutters were closed, there were few flies, and it was so\\nclean that Levin was anxious that Laska, who had been running along the\\nroad and bathing in puddles, should not muddy the floor, and ordered\\nher to a place in the corner by the door. After looking round the\\nparlor, Levin went out in the back yard. The good-looking young woman\\nin clogs, swinging the empty pails on the yoke, ran on before him to\\nthe well for water.\\n\\n“Look sharp, my girl!” the old man shouted after her, good-humoredly,\\nand he went up to Levin. “Well, sir, are you going to Nikolay\\nIvanovitch Sviazhsky? His honor comes to us too,” he began, chatting,\\nleaning his elbows on the railing of the steps. In the middle of the\\nold man’s account of his acquaintance with Sviazhsky, the gates creaked\\nagain, and laborers came into the yard from the fields, with wooden\\nploughs and harrows. The horses harnessed to the ploughs and harrows\\nwere sleek and fat. The laborers were obviously of the household: two\\nwere young men in cotton shirts and caps, the two others were hired\\nlaborers in homespun shirts, one an old man, the other a young fellow.\\nMoving off from the steps, the old man went up to the horses and began\\nunharnessing them.\\n\\n“What have they been ploughing?” asked Levin.\\n\\n“Ploughing up the potatoes. We rent a bit of land too. Fedot, don’t let\\nout the gelding, but take it to the trough, and we’ll put the other in\\nharness.”\\n\\n“Oh, father, the ploughshares I ordered, has he brought them along?”\\nasked the big, healthy-looking fellow, obviously the old man’s son.\\n\\n“There ... in the outer room,” answered the old man, bundling together\\nthe harness he had taken off, and flinging it on the ground. “You can\\nput them on, while they have dinner.”\\n\\nThe good-looking young woman came into the outer room with the full\\npails dragging at her shoulders. More women came on the scene from\\nsomewhere, young and handsome, middle-aged, old and ugly, with children\\nand without children.\\n\\nThe samovar was beginning to sing; the laborers and the family, having\\ndisposed of the horses, came in to dinner. Levin, getting his\\nprovisions out of his carriage, invited the old man to take tea with\\nhim.\\n\\n“Well, I have had some today already,” said the old man, obviously\\naccepting the invitation with pleasure. “But just a glass for company.”\\n\\nOver their tea Levin heard all about the old man’s farming. Ten years\\nbefore, the old man had rented three hundred acres from the lady who\\nowned them, and a year ago he had bought them and rented another three\\nhundred from a neighboring landowner. A small part of the land—the\\nworst part—he let out for rent, while a hundred acres of arable land he\\ncultivated himself with his family and two hired laborers. The old man\\ncomplained that things were doing badly. But Levin saw that he simply\\ndid so from a feeling of propriety, and that his farm was in a\\nflourishing condition. If it had been unsuccessful he would not have\\nbought land at thirty-five roubles the acre, he would not have married\\nhis three sons and a nephew, he would not have rebuilt twice after\\nfires, and each time on a larger scale. In spite of the old man’s\\ncomplaints, it was evident that he was proud, and justly proud, of his\\nprosperity, proud of his sons, his nephew, his sons’ wives, his horses\\nand his cows, and especially of the fact that he was keeping all this\\nfarming going. From his conversation with the old man, Levin thought he\\nwas not averse to new methods either. He had planted a great many\\npotatoes, and his potatoes, as Levin had seen driving past, were\\nalready past flowering and beginning to die down, while Levin’s were\\nonly just coming into flower. He earthed up his potatoes with a modern\\nplough borrowed from a neighboring landowner. He sowed wheat. The\\ntrifling fact that, thinning out his rye, the old man used the rye he\\nthinned out for his horses, specially struck Levin. How many times had\\nLevin seen this splendid fodder wasted, and tried to get it saved; but\\nalways it had turned out to be impossible. The peasant got this done,\\nand he could not say enough in praise of it as food for the beasts.\\n\\n“What have the wenches to do? They carry it out in bundles to the\\nroadside, and the cart brings it away.”\\n\\n“Well, we landowners can’t manage well with our laborers,” said Levin,\\nhanding him a glass of tea.\\n\\n“Thank you,” said the old man, and he took the glass, but refused\\nsugar, pointing to a lump he had left. “They’re simple destruction,”\\nsaid he. “Look at Sviazhsky’s, for instance. We know what the land’s\\nlike—first-rate, yet there’s not much of a crop to boast of. It’s not\\nlooked after enough—that’s all it is!”\\n\\n“But you work your land with hired laborers?”\\n\\n“We’re all peasants together. We go into everything ourselves. If a\\nman’s no use, he can go, and we can manage by ourselves.”\\n\\n“Father, Finogen wants some tar,” said the young woman in the clogs,\\ncoming in.\\n\\n“Yes, yes, that’s how it is, sir!” said the old man, getting up, and\\ncrossing himself deliberately, he thanked Levin and went out.\\n\\nWhen Levin went into the kitchen to call his coachman he saw the whole\\nfamily at dinner. The women were standing up waiting on them. The\\nyoung, sturdy-looking son was telling something funny with his mouth\\nfull of pudding, and they were all laughing, the woman in the clogs,\\nwho was pouring cabbage soup into a bowl, laughing most merrily of all.\\n\\nVery probably the good-looking face of the young woman in the clogs had\\na good deal to do with the impression of well-being this peasant\\nhousehold made upon Levin, but the impression was so strong that Levin\\ncould never get rid of it. And all the way from the old peasant’s to\\nSviazhsky’s he kept recalling this peasant farm as though there were\\nsomething in this impression that demanded his special attention 26\\n\\nSviazhsky was the marshal of his district. He was five years older than\\nLevin, and had long been married. His sister-in-law, a young girl Levin\\nliked very much, lived in his house; and Levin knew that Sviazhsky and\\nhis wife would have greatly liked to marry the girl to him. He knew\\nthis with certainty, as so-called eligible young men always know it,\\nthough he could never have brought himself to speak of it to anyone;\\nand he knew too that, although he wanted to get married, and although\\nby every token this very attractive girl would make an excellent wife,\\nhe could no more have married her, even if he had not been in love with\\nKitty Shtcherbatskaya, than he could have flown up to the sky. And this\\nknowledge poisoned the pleasure he had hoped to find in the visit to\\nSviazhsky.\\n\\nOn getting Sviazhsky’s letter with the invitation for shooting, Levin\\nhad immediately thought of this; but in spite of it he had made up his\\nmind that Sviazhsky’s having such views for him was simply his own\\ngroundless supposition, and so he would go, all the same. Besides, at\\nthe bottom of his heart he had a desire to try himself, put himself to\\nthe test in regard to this girl. The Sviazhskys’ home-life was\\nexceedingly pleasant, and Sviazhsky himself, the best type of man\\ntaking part in local affairs that Levin knew, was very interesting to\\nhim.\\n\\nSviazhsky was one of those people, always a source of wonder to Levin,\\nwhose convictions, very logical though never original, go one way by\\nthemselves, while their life, exceedingly definite and firm in its\\ndirection, goes its way quite apart and almost always in direct\\ncontradiction to their convictions. Sviazhsky was an extremely advanced\\nman. He despised the nobility, and believed the mass of the nobility to\\nbe secretly in favor of serfdom, and only concealing their views from\\ncowardice. He regarded Russia as a ruined country, rather after the\\nstyle of Turkey, and the government of Russia as so bad that he never\\npermitted himself to criticize its doings seriously, and yet he was a\\nfunctionary of that government and a model marshal of nobility, and\\nwhen he drove about he always wore the cockade of office and the cap\\nwith the red band. He considered human life only tolerable abroad, and\\nwent abroad to stay at every opportunity, and at the same time he\\ncarried on a complex and improved system of agriculture in Russia, and\\nwith extreme interest followed everything and knew everything that was\\nbeing done in Russia. He considered the Russian peasant as occupying a\\nstage of development intermediate between the ape and the man, and at\\nthe same time in the local assemblies no one was readier to shake hands\\nwith the peasants and listen to their opinion. He believed neither in\\nGod nor the devil, but was much concerned about the question of the\\nimprovement of the clergy and the maintenance of their revenues, and\\ntook special trouble to keep up the church in his village.\\n\\nOn the woman question he was on the side of the extreme advocates of\\ncomplete liberty for women, and especially their right to labor. But he\\nlived with his wife on such terms that their affectionate childless\\nhome life was the admiration of everyone, and arranged his wife’s life\\nso that she did nothing and could do nothing but share her husband’s\\nefforts that her time should pass as happily and as agreeably as\\npossible.\\n\\nIf it had not been a characteristic of Levin’s to put the most\\nfavorable interpretation on people, Sviazhsky’s character would have\\npresented no doubt or difficulty to him: he would have said to himself,\\n“a fool or a knave,” and everything would have seemed clear. But he\\ncould not say “a fool,” because Sviazhsky was unmistakably clever, and\\nmoreover, a highly cultivated man, who was exceptionally modest over\\nhis culture. There was not a subject he knew nothing of. But he did not\\ndisplay his knowledge except when he was compelled to do so. Still less\\ncould Levin say that he was a knave, as Sviazhsky was unmistakably an\\nhonest, good-hearted, sensible man, who worked good-humoredly, keenly,\\nand perseveringly at his work; he was held in high honor by everyone\\nabout him, and certainly he had never consciously done, and was indeed\\nincapable of doing, anything base.\\n\\nLevin tried to understand him, and could not understand him, and looked\\nat him and his life as at a living enigma.\\n\\nLevin and he were very friendly, and so Levin used to venture to sound\\nSviazhsky, to try to get at the very foundation of his view of life;\\nbut it was always in vain. Every time Levin tried to penetrate beyond\\nthe outer chambers of Sviazhsky’s mind, which were hospitably open to\\nall, he noticed that Sviazhsky was slightly disconcerted; faint signs\\nof alarm were visible in his eyes, as though he were afraid Levin would\\nunderstand him, and he would give him a kindly, good-humored repulse.\\n\\nJust now, since his disenchantment with farming, Levin was particularly\\nglad to stay with Sviazhsky. Apart from the fact that the sight of this\\nhappy and affectionate couple, so pleased with themselves and everyone\\nelse, and their well-ordered home had always a cheering effect on\\nLevin, he felt a longing, now that he was so dissatisfied with his own\\nlife, to get at that secret in Sviazhsky that gave him such clearness,\\ndefiniteness, and good courage in life. Moreover, Levin knew that at\\nSviazhsky’s he should meet the landowners of the neighborhood, and it\\nwas particularly interesting for him just now to hear and take part in\\nthose rural conversations concerning crops, laborers’ wages, and so on,\\nwhich, he was aware, are conventionally regarded as something very low,\\nbut which seemed to him just now to constitute the one subject of\\nimportance. “It was not, perhaps, of importance in the days of serfdom,\\nand it may not be of importance in England. In both cases the\\nconditions of agriculture are firmly established; but among us now,\\nwhen everything has been turned upside down and is only just taking\\nshape, the question what form these conditions will take is the one\\nquestion of importance in Russia,” thought Levin.\\n\\nThe shooting turned out to be worse than Levin had expected. The marsh\\nwas dry and there were no grouse at all. He walked about the whole day\\nand only brought back three birds, but to make up for that—he brought\\nback, as he always did from shooting, an excellent appetite, excellent\\nspirits, and that keen, intellectual mood which with him always\\naccompanied violent physical exertion. And while out shooting, when he\\nseemed to be thinking of nothing at all, suddenly the old man and his\\nfamily kept coming back to his mind, and the impression of them seemed\\nto claim not merely his attention, but the solution of some question\\nconnected with them.\\n\\nIn the evening at tea, two landowners who had come about some business\\nconnected with a wardship were of the party, and the interesting\\nconversation Levin had been looking forward to sprang up.\\n\\nLevin was sitting beside his hostess at the tea table, and was obliged\\nto keep up a conversation with her and her sister, who was sitting\\nopposite him. Madame Sviazhskaya was a round-faced, fair-haired, rather\\nshort woman, all smiles and dimples. Levin tried through her to get a\\nsolution of the weighty enigma her husband presented to his mind; but\\nhe had not complete freedom of ideas, because he was in an agony of\\nembarrassment. This agony of embarrassment was due to the fact that the\\nsister-in-law was sitting opposite to him, in a dress, specially put\\non, as he fancied, for his benefit, cut particularly open, in the shape\\nof a trapeze, on her white bosom. This quadrangular opening, in spite\\nof the bosom’s being very white, or just because it was very white,\\ndeprived Levin of the full use of his faculties. He imagined, probably\\nmistakenly, that this low-necked bodice had been made on his account,\\nand felt that he had no right to look at it, and tried not to look at\\nit; but he felt that he was to blame for the very fact of the\\nlow-necked bodice having been made. It seemed to Levin that he had\\ndeceived someone, that he ought to explain something, but that to\\nexplain it was impossible, and for that reason he was continually\\nblushing, was ill at ease and awkward. His awkwardness infected the\\npretty sister-in-law too. But their hostess appeared not to observe\\nthis, and kept purposely drawing her into the conversation.\\n\\n“You say,” she said, pursuing the subject that had been started, “that\\nmy husband cannot be interested in what’s Russian. It’s quite the\\ncontrary; he is always in cheerful spirits abroad, but not as he is\\nhere. Here, he feels in his proper place. He has so much to do, and he\\nhas the faculty of interesting himself in everything. Oh, you’ve not\\nbeen to see our school, have you?”\\n\\n“I’ve seen it.... The little house covered with ivy, isn’t it?”\\n\\n“Yes; that’s Nastia’s work,” she said, indicating her sister.\\n\\n“You teach in it yourself?” asked Levin, trying to look above the open\\nneck, but feeling that wherever he looked in that direction he should\\nsee it.\\n\\n“Yes; I used to teach in it myself, and do teach still, but we have a\\nfirst-rate schoolmistress now. And we’ve started gymnastic exercises.”\\n\\n“No, thank you, I won’t have any more tea,” said Levin, and conscious\\nof doing a rude thing, but incapable of continuing the conversation, he\\ngot up, blushing. “I hear a very interesting conversation,” he added,\\nand walked to the other end of the table, where Sviazhsky was sitting\\nwith the two gentlemen of the neighborhood. Sviazhsky was sitting\\nsideways, with one elbow on the table, and a cup in one hand, while\\nwith the other hand he gathered up his beard, held it to his nose and\\nlet it drop again, as though he were smelling it. His brilliant black\\neyes were looking straight at the excited country gentleman with gray\\nwhiskers, and apparently he derived amusement from his remarks. The\\ngentleman was complaining of the peasants. It was evident to Levin that\\nSviazhsky knew an answer to this gentleman’s complaints, which would at\\nonce demolish his whole contention, but that in his position he could\\nnot give utterance to this answer, and listened, not without pleasure,\\nto the landowner’s comic speeches.\\n\\nThe gentleman with the gray whiskers was obviously an inveterate\\nadherent of serfdom and a devoted agriculturist, who had lived all his\\nlife in the country. Levin saw proofs of this in his dress, in the\\nold-fashioned threadbare coat, obviously not his everyday attire, in\\nhis shrewd, deep-set eyes, in his idiomatic, fluent Russian, in the\\nimperious tone that had become habitual from long use, and in the\\nresolute gestures of his large, red, sunburnt hands, with an old\\nbetrothal ring on the little finger 27\\n\\n“If I’d only the heart to throw up what’s been set going ... such a lot\\nof trouble wasted ... I’d turn my back on the whole business, sell up,\\ngo off like Nikolay Ivanovitch ... to hear _La Belle Hélène_,” said the\\nlandowner, a pleasant smile lighting up his shrewd old face.\\n\\n“But you see you don’t throw it up,” said Nikolay Ivanovitch Sviazhsky;\\n“so there must be something gained.”\\n\\n“The only gain is that I live in my own house, neither bought nor\\nhired. Besides, one keeps hoping the people will learn sense. Though,\\ninstead of that, you’d never believe it—the drunkenness, the\\nimmorality! They keep chopping and changing their bits of land. Not a\\nsight of a horse or a cow. The peasant’s dying of hunger, but just go\\nand take him on as a laborer, he’ll do his best to do you a mischief,\\nand then bring you up before the justice of the peace.”\\n\\n“But then you make complaints to the justice too,” said Sviazhsky.\\n\\n“I lodge complaints? Not for anything in the world! Such a talking, and\\nsuch a to-do, that one would have cause to regret it. At the works, for\\ninstance, they pocketed the advance-money and made off. What did the\\njustice do? Why, acquitted them. Nothing keeps them in order but their\\nown communal court and their village elder. He’ll flog them in the good\\nold style! But for that there’d be nothing for it but to give it all up\\nand run away.”\\n\\nObviously the landowner was chaffing Sviazhsky, who, far from resenting\\nit, was apparently amused by it.\\n\\n“But you see we manage our land without such extreme measures,” said\\nhe, smiling: “Levin and I and this gentleman.”\\n\\nHe indicated the other landowner.\\n\\n“Yes, the thing’s done at Mihail Petrovitch’s, but ask him how it’s\\ndone. Do you call that a rational system?” said the landowner,\\nobviously rather proud of the word “rational.”\\n\\n“My system’s very simple,” said Mihail Petrovitch, “thank God. All my\\nmanagement rests on getting the money ready for the autumn taxes, and\\nthe peasants come to me, ‘Father, master, help us!’ Well, the peasants\\nare all one’s neighbors; one feels for them. So one advances them a\\nthird, but one says: ‘Remember, lads, I have helped you, and you must\\nhelp me when I need it—whether it’s the sowing of the oats, or the\\nhaycutting, or the harvest’; and well, one agrees, so much for each\\ntaxpayer—though there are dishonest ones among them too, it’s true.”\\n\\nLevin, who had long been familiar with these patriarchal methods,\\nexchanged glances with Sviazhsky and interrupted Mihail Petrovitch,\\nturning again to the gentleman with the gray whiskers.\\n\\n“Then what do you think?” he asked; “what system is one to adopt\\nnowadays?”\\n\\n“Why, manage like Mihail Petrovitch, or let the land for half the crop\\nor for rent to the peasants; that one can do—only that’s just how the\\ngeneral prosperity of the country is being ruined. Where the land with\\nserf-labor and good management gave a yield of nine to one, on the\\nhalf-crop system it yields three to one. Russia has been ruined by the\\nemancipation!”\\n\\nSviazhsky looked with smiling eyes at Levin, and even made a faint\\ngesture of irony to him; but Levin did not think the landowner’s words\\nabsurd, he understood them better than he did Sviazhsky. A great deal\\nmore of what the gentleman with the gray whiskers said to show in what\\nway Russia was ruined by the emancipation struck him indeed as very\\ntrue, new to him, and quite incontestable. The landowner unmistakably\\nspoke his own individual thought—a thing that very rarely happens—and a\\nthought to which he had been brought not by a desire of finding some\\nexercise for an idle brain, but a thought which had grown up out of the\\nconditions of his life, which he had brooded over in the solitude of\\nhis village, and had considered in every aspect.\\n\\n“The point is, don’t you see, that progress of every sort is only made\\nby the use of authority,” he said, evidently wishing to show he was not\\nwithout culture. “Take the reforms of Peter, of Catherine, of\\nAlexander. Take European history. And progress in agriculture more than\\nanything else—the potato, for instance, that was introduced among us by\\nforce. The wooden plough too wasn’t always used. It was introduced\\nmaybe in the days before the Empire, but it was probably brought in by\\nforce. Now, in our own day, we landowners in the serf times used\\nvarious improvements in our husbandry: drying machines and thrashing\\nmachines, and carting manure and all the modern implements—all that we\\nbrought into use by our authority, and the peasants opposed it at\\nfirst, and ended by imitating us. Now, by the abolition of serfdom we\\nhave been deprived of our authority; and so our husbandry, where it had\\nbeen raised to a high level, is bound to sink to the most savage\\nprimitive condition. That’s how I see it.”\\n\\n“But why so? If it’s rational, you’ll be able to keep up the same\\nsystem with hired labor,” said Sviazhsky.\\n\\n“We’ve no power over them. With whom am I going to work the system,\\nallow me to ask?”\\n\\n“There it is—the labor force—the chief element in agriculture,” thought\\nLevin.\\n\\n“With laborers.”\\n\\n“The laborers won’t work well, and won’t work with good implements. Our\\nlaborer can do nothing but get drunk like a pig, and when he’s drunk he\\nruins everything you give him. He makes the horses ill with too much\\nwater, cuts good harness, barters the tires of the wheels for drink,\\ndrops bits of iron into the thrashing machine, so as to break it. He\\nloathes the sight of anything that’s not after his fashion. And that’s\\nhow it is the whole level of husbandry has fallen. Lands gone out of\\ncultivation, overgrown with weeds, or divided among the peasants, and\\nwhere millions of bushels were raised you get a hundred thousand; the\\nwealth of the country has decreased. If the same thing had been done,\\nbut with care that....”\\n\\nAnd he proceeded to unfold his own scheme of emancipation by means of\\nwhich these drawbacks might have been avoided.\\n\\nThis did not interest Levin, but when he had finished, Levin went back\\nto his first position, and, addressing Sviazhsky, and trying to draw\\nhim into expressing his serious opinion:—\\n\\n“That the standard of culture is falling, and that with our present\\nrelations to the peasants there is no possibility of farming on a\\nrational system to yield a profit—that’s perfectly true,” said he.\\n\\n“I don’t believe it,” Sviazhsky replied quite seriously; “all I see is\\nthat we don’t know how to cultivate the land, and that our system of\\nagriculture in the serf days was by no means too high, but too low. We\\nhave no machines, no good stock, no efficient supervision; we don’t\\neven know how to keep accounts. Ask any landowner; he won’t be able to\\ntell you what crop’s profitable, and what’s not.”\\n\\n“Italian bookkeeping,” said the gentleman of the gray whiskers\\nironically. “You may keep your books as you like, but if they spoil\\neverything for you, there won’t be any profit.”\\n\\n“Why do they spoil things? A poor thrashing machine, or your Russian\\npresser, they will break, but my steam press they don’t break. A\\nwretched Russian nag they’ll ruin, but keep good dray-horses—they won’t\\nruin them. And so it is all round. We must raise our farming to a\\nhigher level.”\\n\\n“Oh, if one only had the means to do it, Nikolay Ivanovitch! It’s all\\nvery well for you; but for me, with a son to keep at the university,\\nlads to be educated at the high school—how am I going to buy these\\ndray-horses?”\\n\\n“Well, that’s what the land banks are for.”\\n\\n“To get what’s left me sold by auction? No, thank you.”\\n\\n“I don’t agree that it’s necessary or possible to raise the level of\\nagriculture still higher,” said Levin. “I devote myself to it, and I\\nhave means, but I can do nothing. As to the banks, I don’t know to whom\\nthey’re any good. For my part, anyway, whatever I’ve spent money on in\\nthe way of husbandry, it has been a loss: stock—a loss, machinery—a\\nloss.”\\n\\n“That’s true enough,” the gentleman with the gray whiskers chimed in,\\npositively laughing with satisfaction.\\n\\n“And I’m not the only one,” pursued Levin. “I mix with all the\\nneighboring landowners, who are cultivating their land on a rational\\nsystem; they all, with rare exceptions, are doing so at a loss. Come,\\ntell us how does your land do—does it pay?” said Levin, and at once in\\nSviazhsky’s eyes he detected that fleeting expression of alarm which he\\nhad noticed whenever he had tried to penetrate beyond the outer\\nchambers of Sviazhsky’s mind.\\n\\nMoreover, this question on Levin’s part was not quite in good faith.\\nMadame Sviazhskaya had just told him at tea that they had that summer\\ninvited a German expert in bookkeeping from Moscow, who for a\\nconsideration of five hundred roubles had investigated the management\\nof their property, and found that it was costing them a loss of three\\nthousand odd roubles. She did not remember the precise sum, but it\\nappeared that the German had worked it out to the fraction of a\\nfarthing.\\n\\nThe gray-whiskered landowner smiled at the mention of the profits of\\nSviazhsky’s famling, obviously aware how much gain his neighbor and\\nmarshal was likely to be making.\\n\\n“Possibly it does not pay,” answered Sviazhsky. “That merely proves\\neither that I’m a bad manager, or that I’ve sunk my capital for the\\nincrease of my rents.”\\n\\n“Oh, rent!” Levin cried with horror. “Rent there may be in Europe,\\nwhere land has been improved by the labor put into it, but with us all\\nthe land is deteriorating from the labor put into it—in other words\\nthey’re working it out; so there’s no question of rent.”\\n\\n“How no rent? It’s a law.”\\n\\n“Then we’re outside the law; rent explains nothing for us, but simply\\nmuddles us. No, tell me how there can be a theory of rent?...”\\n\\n“Will you have some junket? Masha, pass us some junket or raspberries.”\\nHe turned to his wife. “Extraordinarily late the raspberries are\\nlasting this year.”\\n\\nAnd in the happiest frame of mind Sviazhsky got up and walked off,\\napparently supposing the conversation to have ended at the very point\\nwhen to Levin it seemed that it was only just beginning.\\n\\nHaving lost his antagonist, Levin continued the conversation with the\\ngray-whiskered landowner, trying to prove to him that all the\\ndifficulty arises from the fact that we don’t find out the\\npeculiarities and habits of our laborer; but the landowner, like all\\nmen who think independently and in isolation, was slow in taking in any\\nother person’s idea, and particularly partial to his own. He stuck to\\nit that the Russian peasant is a swine and likes swinishness, and that\\nto get him out of his swinishness one must have authority, and there is\\nnone; one must have the stick, and we have become so liberal that we\\nhave all of a sudden replaced the stick that served us for a thousand\\nyears by lawyers and model prisons, where the worthless, stinking\\npeasant is fed on good soup and has a fixed allowance of cubic feet of\\nair.\\n\\n“What makes you think,” said Levin, trying to get back to the question,\\n“that it’s impossible to find some relation to the laborer in which the\\nlabor would become productive?”\\n\\n“That never could be so with the Russian peasantry; we’ve no power over\\nthem,” answered the landowner.\\n\\n“How can new conditions be found?” said Sviazhsky. Having eaten some\\njunket and lighted a cigarette, he came back to the discussion. “All\\npossible relations to the labor force have been defined and studied,”\\nhe said. “The relic of barbarism, the primitive commune with each\\nguarantee for all, will disappear of itself; serfdom has been\\nabolished—there remains nothing but free labor, and its forms are fixed\\nand ready made, and must be adopted. Permanent hands, day-laborers,\\nrammers—you can’t get out of those forms.”\\n\\n“But Europe is dissatisfied with these forms.”\\n\\n“Dissatisfied, and seeking new ones. And will find them, in all\\nprobability.”\\n\\n“That’s just what I was meaning,” answered Levin. “Why shouldn’t we\\nseek them for ourselves?”\\n\\n“Because it would be just like inventing afresh the means for\\nconstructing railways. They are ready, invented.”\\n\\n“But if they don’t do for us, if they’re stupid?” said Levin.\\n\\nAnd again he detected the expression of alarm in the eyes of Sviazhsky.\\n\\n“Oh, yes; we’ll bury the world under our caps! We’ve found the secret\\nEurope was seeking for! I’ve heard all that; but, excuse me, do you\\nknow all that’s been done in Europe on the question of the organization\\nof labor?”\\n\\n“No, very little.”\\n\\n“That question is now absorbing the best minds in Europe. The\\nSchulze-Delitsch movement.... And then all this enormous literature of\\nthe labor question, the most liberal Lassalle movement ... the\\nMulhausen experiment? That’s a fact by now, as you’re probably aware.”\\n\\n“I have some idea of it, but very vague.”\\n\\n“No, you only say that; no doubt you know all about it as well as I do.\\nI’m not a professor of sociology, of course, but it interested me, and\\nreally, if it interests you, you ought to study it.”\\n\\n“But what conclusion have they come to?”\\n\\n“Excuse me....”\\n\\nThe two neighbors had risen, and Sviazhsky, once more checking Levin in\\nhis inconvenient habit of peeping into what was beyond the outer\\nchambers of his mind, went to see his guests out 28\\n\\nLevin was insufferably bored that evening with the ladies; he was\\nstirred as he had never been before by the idea that the\\ndissatisfaction he was feeling with his system of managing his land was\\nnot an exceptional case, but the general condition of things in Russia;\\nthat the organization of some relation of the laborers to the soil in\\nwhich they would work, as with the peasant he had met half-way to the\\nSviazhskys’, was not a dream, but a problem which must be solved. And\\nit seemed to him that the problem could be solved, and that he ought to\\ntry and solve it.\\n\\nAfter saying good-night to the ladies, and promising to stay the whole\\nof the next day, so as to make an expedition on horseback with them to\\nsee an interesting ruin in the crown forest, Levin went, before going\\nto bed, into his host’s study to get the books on the labor question\\nthat Sviazhsky had offered him. Sviazhsky’s study was a huge room,\\nsurrounded by bookcases and with two tables in it—one a massive\\nwriting-table, standing in the middle of the room, and the other a\\nround table, covered with recent numbers of reviews and journals in\\ndifferent languages, ranged like the rays of a star round the lamp. On\\nthe writing-table was a stand of drawers marked with gold lettering,\\nand full of papers of various sorts.\\n\\nSviazhsky took out the books, and sat down in a rocking-chair.\\n\\n“What are you looking at there?” he said to Levin, who was standing at\\nthe round table looking through the reviews.\\n\\n“Oh, yes, there’s a very interesting article here,” said Sviazhsky of\\nthe review Levin was holding in his hand. “It appears,” he went on,\\nwith eager interest, “that Friedrich was not, after all, the person\\nchiefly responsible for the partition of Poland. It is proved....”\\n\\nAnd with his characteristic clearness, he summed up those new, very\\nimportant, and interesting revelations. Although Levin was engrossed at\\nthe moment by his ideas about the problem of the land, he wondered, as\\nhe heard Sviazhsky: “What is there inside of him? And why, why is he\\ninterested in the partition of Poland?” When Sviazhsky had finished,\\nLevin could not help asking: “Well, and what then?” But there was\\nnothing to follow. It was simply interesting that it had been proved to\\nbe so and so. But Sviazhsky did not explain, and saw no need to explain\\nwhy it was interesting to him.\\n\\n“Yes, but I was very much interested by your irritable neighbor,” said\\nLevin, sighing. “He’s a clever fellow, and said a lot that was true.”\\n\\n“Oh, get along with you! An inveterate supporter of serfdom at heart,\\nlike all of them!” said Sviazhsky.\\n\\n“Whose marshal you are.”\\n\\n“Yes, only I marshal them in the other direction,” said Sviazhsky,\\nlaughing.\\n\\n“I’ll tell you what interests me very much,” said Levin. “He’s right\\nthat our system, that’s to say of rational farming, doesn’t answer,\\nthat the only thing that answers is the money-lender system, like that\\nmeek-looking gentleman’s, or else the very simplest.... Whose fault is\\nit?”\\n\\n“Our own, of course. Besides, it’s not true that it doesn’t answer. It\\nanswers with Vassiltchikov.”\\n\\n“A factory....”\\n\\n“But I really don’t know what it is you are surprised at. The people\\nare at such a low stage of rational and moral development, that it’s\\nobvious they’re bound to oppose everything that’s strange to them. In\\nEurope, a rational system answers because the people are educated; it\\nfollows that we must educate the people—that’s all.”\\n\\n“But how are we to educate the people?”\\n\\n“To educate the people three things are needed: schools, and schools,\\nand schools.”\\n\\n“But you said yourself the people are at such a low stage of material\\ndevelopment: what help are schools for that?”\\n\\n“Do you know, you remind me of the story of the advice given to the\\nsick man—You should try purgative medicine. Taken: worse. Try leeches.\\nTried them: worse. Well, then, there’s nothing left but to pray to God.\\nTried it: worse. That’s just how it is with us. I say political\\neconomy; you say—worse. I say socialism: worse. Education: worse.”\\n\\n“But how do schools help matters?”\\n\\n“They give the peasant fresh wants.”\\n\\n“Well, that’s a thing I’ve never understood,” Levin replied with heat.\\n“In what way are schools going to help the people to improve their\\nmaterial position? You say schools, education, will give them fresh\\nwants. So much the worse, since they won’t be capable of satisfying\\nthem. And in what way a knowledge of addition and subtraction and the\\ncatechism is going to improve their material condition, I never could\\nmake out. The day before yesterday, I met a peasant woman in the\\nevening with a little baby, and asked her where she was going. She said\\nshe was going to the wise woman; her boy had screaming fits, so she was\\ntaking him to be doctored. I asked, ‘Why, how does the wise woman cure\\nscreaming fits?’ ‘She puts the child on the hen-roost and repeats some\\ncharm....’”\\n\\n“Well, you’re saying it yourself! What’s wanted to prevent her taking\\nher child to the hen-roost to cure it of screaming fits is just....”\\nSviazhsky said, smiling good-humoredly.\\n\\n“Oh, no!” said Levin with annoyance; “that method of doctoring I merely\\nmeant as a simile for doctoring the people with schools. The people are\\npoor and ignorant—that we see as surely as the peasant woman sees the\\nbaby is ill because it screams. But in what way this trouble of poverty\\nand ignorance is to be cured by schools is as incomprehensible as how\\nthe hen-roost affects the screaming. What has to be cured is what makes\\nhim poor.”\\n\\n“Well, in that, at least, you’re in agreement with Spencer, whom you\\ndislike so much. He says, too, that education may be the consequence of\\ngreater prosperity and comfort, of more frequent washing, as he says,\\nbut not of being able to read and write....”\\n\\n“Well, then, I’m very glad—or the contrary, very sorry, that I’m in\\nagreement with Spencer; only I’ve known it a long while. Schools can do\\nno good; what will do good is an economic organization in which the\\npeople will become richer, will have more leisure—and then there will\\nbe schools.”\\n\\n“Still, all over Europe now schools are obligatory.”\\n\\n“And how far do you agree with Spencer yourself about it?” asked Levin.\\n\\nBut there was a gleam of alarm in Sviazhsky’s eyes, and he said\\nsmiling:\\n\\n“No; that screaming story is positively capital! Did you really hear it\\nyourself?”\\n\\nLevin saw that he was not to discover the connection between this man’s\\nlife and his thoughts. Obviously he did not care in the least what his\\nreasoning led him to; all he wanted was the process of reasoning. And\\nhe did not like it when the process of reasoning brought him into a\\nblind alley. That was the only thing he disliked, and avoided by\\nchanging the conversation to something agreeable and amusing.\\n\\nAll the impressions of the day, beginning with the impression made by\\nthe old peasant, which served, as it were, as the fundamental basis of\\nall the conceptions and ideas of the day, threw Levin into violent\\nexcitement. This dear good Sviazhsky, keeping a stock of ideas simply\\nfor social purposes, and obviously having some other principles hidden\\nfrom Levin, while with the crowd, whose name is legion, he guided\\npublic opinion by ideas he did not share; that irascible country\\ngentleman, perfectly correct in the conclusions that he had been\\nworried into by life, but wrong in his exasperation against a whole\\nclass, and that the best class in Russia; his own dissatisfaction with\\nthe work he had been doing, and the vague hope of finding a remedy for\\nall this—all was blended in a sense of inward turmoil, and anticipation\\nof some solution near at hand.\\n\\nLeft alone in the room assigned him, lying on a spring mattress that\\nyielded unexpectedly at every movement of his arm or his leg, Levin did\\nnot fall asleep for a long while. Not one conversation with Sviazhsky,\\nthough he had said a great deal that was clever, had interested Levin;\\nbut the conclusions of the irascible landowner required consideration.\\nLevin could not help recalling every word he had said, and in\\nimagination amending his own replies.\\n\\n“Yes, I ought to have said to him: You say that our husbandry does not\\nanswer because the peasant hates improvements, and that they must be\\nforced on him by authority. If no system of husbandry answered at all\\nwithout these improvements, you would be quite right. But the only\\nsystem that does answer is where laborer is working in accordance with\\nhis habits, just as on the old peasant’s land half-way here. Your and\\nour general dissatisfaction with the system shows that either we are to\\nblame or the laborers. We have gone our way—the European way—a long\\nwhile, without asking ourselves about the qualities of our labor force.\\nLet us try to look upon the labor force not as an abstract force, but\\nas the _Russian peasant_ with his instincts, and we shall arrange our\\nsystem of culture in accordance with that. Imagine, I ought to have\\nsaid to him, that you have the same system as the old peasant has, that\\nyou have found means of making your laborers take an interest in the\\nsuccess of the work, and have found the happy mean in the way of\\nimprovements which they will admit, and you will, without exhausting\\nthe soil, get twice or three times the yield you got before. Divide it\\nin halves, give half as the share of labor, the surplus left you will\\nbe greater, and the share of labor will be greater too. And to do this\\none must lower the standard of husbandry and interest the laborers in\\nits success. How to do this?—that’s a matter of detail; but undoubtedly\\nit can be done.”\\n\\nThis idea threw Levin into a great excitement. He did not sleep half\\nthe night, thinking over in detail the putting of his idea into\\npractice. He had not intended to go away next day, but he now\\ndetermined to go home early in the morning. Besides, the sister-in-law\\nwith her low-necked bodice aroused in him a feeling akin to shame and\\nremorse for some utterly base action. Most important of all—he must get\\nback without delay: he would have to make haste to put his new project\\nto the peasants before the sowing of the winter wheat, so that the\\nsowing might be undertaken on a new basis. He had made up his mind to\\nrevolutionize his whole system 29\\n\\nThe carrying out of Levin’s plan presented many difficulties; but he\\nstruggled on, doing his utmost, and attained a result which, though not\\nwhat he desired, was enough to enable him, without self-deception, to\\nbelieve that the attempt was worth the trouble. One of the chief\\ndifficulties was that the process of cultivating the land was in full\\nswing, that it was impossible to stop everything and begin it all again\\nfrom the beginning, and the machine had to be mended while in motion.\\n\\nWhen on the evening that he arrived home he informed the bailiff of his\\nplans, the latter with visible pleasure agreed with what he said so\\nlong as he was pointing out that all that had been done up to that time\\nwas stupid and useless. The bailiff said that he had said so a long\\nwhile ago, but no heed had been paid him. But as for the proposal made\\nby Levin—to take a part as shareholder with his laborers in each\\nagricultural undertaking—at this the bailiff simply expressed a\\nprofound despondency, and offered no definite opinion, but began\\nimmediately talking of the urgent necessity of carrying the remaining\\nsheaves of rye the next day, and of sending the men out for the second\\nploughing, so that Levin felt that this was not the time for discussing\\nit.\\n\\nOn beginning to talk to the peasants about it, and making a proposition\\nto cede them the land on new terms, he came into collision with the\\nsame great difficulty that they were so much absorbed by the current\\nwork of the day, that they had not time to consider the advantages and\\ndisadvantages of the proposed scheme.\\n\\nThe simple-hearted Ivan, the cowherd, seemed completely to grasp\\nLevin’s proposal—that he should with his family take a share of the\\nprofits of the cattle-yard—and he was in complete sympathy with the\\nplan. But when Levin hinted at the future advantages, Ivan’s face\\nexpressed alarm and regret that he could not hear all he had to say,\\nand he made haste to find himself some task that would admit of no\\ndelay: he either snatched up the fork to pitch the hay out of the pens,\\nor ran to get water or to clear out the dung.\\n\\nAnother difficulty lay in the invincible disbelief of the peasant that\\na landowner’s object could be anything else than a desire to squeeze\\nall he could out of them. They were firmly convinced that his real aim\\n(whatever he might say to them) would always be in what he did not say\\nto them. And they themselves, in giving their opinion, said a great\\ndeal but never said what was their real object. Moreover (Levin felt\\nthat the irascible landowner had been right) the peasants made their\\nfirst and unalterable condition of any agreement whatever that they\\nshould not be forced to any new methods of tillage of any kind, nor to\\nuse new implements. They agreed that the modern plough ploughed better,\\nthat the scarifier did the work more quickly, but they found thousands\\nof reasons that made it out of the question for them to use either of\\nthem; and though he had accepted the conviction that he would have to\\nlower the standard of cultivation, he felt sorry to give up improved\\nmethods, the advantages of which were so obvious. But in spite of all\\nthese difficulties he got his way, and by autumn the system was\\nworking, or at least so it seemed to him.\\n\\nAt first Levin had thought of giving up the whole farming of the land\\njust as it was to the peasants, the laborers, and the bailiff on new\\nconditions of partnership; but he was very soon convinced that this was\\nimpossible, and determined to divide it up. The cattle-yard, the\\ngarden, hay fields, and arable land, divided into several parts, had to\\nbe made into separate lots. The simple-hearted cowherd, Ivan, who,\\nLevin fancied, understood the matter better than any of them,\\ncollecting together a gang of workers to help him, principally of his\\nown family, became a partner in the cattle-yard. A distant part of the\\nestate, a tract of waste land that had lain fallow for eight years, was\\nwith the help of the clever carpenter, Fyodor Ryezunov, taken by six\\nfamilies of peasants on new conditions of partnership, and the peasant\\nShuraev took the management of all the vegetable gardens on the same\\nterms. The remainder of the land was still worked on the old system,\\nbut these three associated partnerships were the first step to a new\\norganization of the whole, and they completely took up Levin’s time.\\n\\nIt is true that in the cattle-yard things went no better than before,\\nand Ivan strenuously opposed warm housing for the cows and butter made\\nof fresh cream, affirming that cows require less food if kept cold, and\\nthat butter is more profitable made from sour cream, and he asked for\\nwages just as under the old system, and took not the slightest interest\\nin the fact that the money he received was not wages but an advance out\\nof his future share in the profits.\\n\\nIt is true that Fyodor Ryezunov’s company did not plough over the\\nground twice before sowing, as had been agreed, justifying themselves\\non the plea that the time was too short. It is true that the peasants\\nof the same company, though they had agreed to work the land on new\\nconditions, always spoke of the land, not as held in partnership, but\\nas rented for half the crop, and more than once the peasants and\\nRyezunov himself said to Levin, “If you would take a rent for the land,\\nit would save you trouble, and we should be more free.” Moreover the\\nsame peasants kept putting off, on various excuses, the building of a\\ncattleyard and barn on the land as agreed upon, and delayed doing it\\ntill the winter.\\n\\nIt is true that Shuraev would have liked to let out the kitchen gardens\\nhe had undertaken in small lots to the peasants. He evidently quite\\nmisunderstood, and apparently intentionally misunderstood, the\\nconditions upon which the land had been given to him.\\n\\nOften, too, talking to the peasants and explaining to them all the\\nadvantages of the plan, Levin felt that the peasants heard nothing but\\nthe sound of his voice, and were firmly resolved, whatever he might\\nsay, not to let themselves be taken in. He felt this especially when he\\ntalked to the cleverest of the peasants, Ryezunov, and detected the\\ngleam in Ryezunov’s eyes which showed so plainly both ironical\\namusement at Levin, and the firm conviction that, if anyone were to be\\ntaken in, it would not be he, Ryezunov. But in spite of all this Levin\\nthought the system worked, and that by keeping accounts strictly and\\ninsisting on his own way, he would prove to them in the future the\\nadvantages of the arrangement, and then the system would go of itself.\\n\\nThese matters, together with the management of the land still left on\\nhis hands, and the indoor work over his book, so engrossed Levin the\\nwhole summer that he scarcely ever went out shooting. At the end of\\nAugust he heard that the Oblonskys had gone away to Moscow, from their\\nservant who brought back the side-saddle. He felt that in not answering\\nDarya Alexandrovna’s letter he had by his rudeness, of which he could\\nnot think without a flush of shame, burned his ships, and that he would\\nnever go and see them again. He had been just as rude with the\\nSviazhskys, leaving them without saying good-bye. But he would never go\\nto see them again either. He did not care about that now. The business\\nof reorganizing the farming of his land absorbed him as completely as\\nthough there would never be anything else in his life. He read the\\nbooks lent him by Sviazhsky, and copying out what he had not got, he\\nread both the economic and socialistic books on the subject, but, as he\\nhad anticipated, found nothing bearing on the scheme he had undertaken.\\nIn the books on political economy—in Mill, for instance, whom he\\nstudied first with great ardor, hoping every minute to find an answer\\nto the questions that were engrossing him—he found laws deduced from\\nthe condition of land culture in Europe; but he did not see why these\\nlaws, which did not apply in Russia, must be general. He saw just the\\nsame thing in the socialistic books: either they were the beautiful but\\nimpracticable fantasies which had fascinated him when he was a student,\\nor they were attempts at improving, rectifying the economic position in\\nwhich Europe was placed, with which the system of land tenure in Russia\\nhad nothing in common. Political economy told him that the laws by\\nwhich the wealth of Europe had been developed, and was developing, were\\nuniversal and unvarying. Socialism told him that development along\\nthese lines leads to ruin. And neither of them gave an answer, or even\\na hint, in reply to the question what he, Levin, and all the Russian\\npeasants and landowners, were to do with their millions of hands and\\nmillions of acres, to make them as productive as possible for the\\ncommon weal.\\n\\nHaving once taken the subject up, he read conscientiously everything\\nbearing on it, and intended in the autumn to go abroad to study land\\nsystems on the spot, in order that he might not on this question be\\nconfronted with what so often met him on various subjects. Often, just\\nas he was beginning to understand the idea in the mind of anyone he was\\ntalking to, and was beginning to explain his own, he would suddenly be\\ntold: “But Kauffmann, but Jones, but Dubois, but Michelli? You haven’t\\nread them: they’ve thrashed that question out thoroughly.”\\n\\nHe saw now distinctly that Kauffmann and Michelli had nothing to tell\\nhim. He knew what he wanted. He saw that Russia has splendid land,\\nsplendid laborers, and that in certain cases, as at the peasant’s on\\nthe way to Sviazhsky’s, the produce raised by the laborers and the land\\nis great—in the majority of cases when capital is applied in the\\nEuropean way the produce is small, and that this simply arises from the\\nfact that the laborers want to work and work well only in their own\\npeculiar way, and that this antagonism is not incidental but\\ninvariable, and has its roots in the national spirit. He thought that\\nthe Russian people whose task it was to colonize and cultivate vast\\ntracts of unoccupied land, consciously adhered, till all their land was\\noccupied, to the methods suitable to their purpose, and that their\\nmethods were by no means so bad as was generally supposed. And he\\nwanted to prove this theoretically in his book and practically on his\\nland 30\\n\\nAt the end of September the timber had been carted for building the\\ncattleyard on the land that had been allotted to the association of\\npeasants, and the butter from the cows was sold and the profits\\ndivided. In practice the system worked capitally, or, at least, so it\\nseemed to Levin. In order to work out the whole subject theoretically\\nand to complete his book, which, in Levin’s daydreams, was not merely\\nto effect a revolution in political economy, but to annihilate that\\nscience entirely and to lay the foundation of a new science of the\\nrelation of the people to the soil, all that was left to do was to make\\na tour abroad, and to study on the spot all that had been done in the\\nsame direction, and to collect conclusive evidence that all that had\\nbeen done there was not what was wanted. Levin was only waiting for the\\ndelivery of his wheat to receive the money for it and go abroad. But\\nthe rains began, preventing the harvesting of the corn and potatoes\\nleft in the fields, and putting a stop to all work, even to the\\ndelivery of the wheat.\\n\\nThe mud was impassable along the roads; two mills were carried away,\\nand the weather got worse and worse.\\n\\nOn the 30th of September the sun came out in the morning, and hoping\\nfor fine weather, Levin began making final preparations for his\\njourney. He gave orders for the wheat to be delivered, sent the bailiff\\nto the merchant to get the money owing him, and went out himself to\\ngive some final directions on the estate before setting off.\\n\\nHaving finished all his business, soaked through with the streams of\\nwater which kept running down the leather behind his neck and his\\ngaiters, but in the keenest and most confident temper, Levin returned\\nhomewards in the evening. The weather had become worse than ever\\ntowards evening; the hail lashed the drenched mare so cruelly that she\\nwent along sideways, shaking her head and ears; but Levin was all right\\nunder his hood, and he looked cheerfully about him at the muddy streams\\nrunning under the wheels, at the drops hanging on every bare twig, at\\nthe whiteness of the patch of unmelted hailstones on the planks of the\\nbridge, at the thick layer of still juicy, fleshy leaves that lay\\nheaped up about the stripped elm-tree. In spite of the gloominess of\\nnature around him, he felt peculiarly eager. The talks he had been\\nhaving with the peasants in the further village had shown that they\\nwere beginning to get used to their new position. The old servant to\\nwhose hut he had gone to get dry evidently approved of Levin’s plan,\\nand of his own accord proposed to enter the partnership by the purchase\\nof cattle.\\n\\n“I have only to go stubbornly on towards my aim, and I shall attain my\\nend,” thought Levin; “and it’s something to work and take trouble for.\\nThis is not a matter of myself individually; the question of the public\\nwelfare comes into it. The whole system of culture, the chief element\\nin the condition of the people, must be completely transformed. Instead\\nof poverty, general prosperity and content; instead of hostility,\\nharmony and unity of interests. In short, a bloodless revolution, but a\\nrevolution of the greatest magnitude, beginning in the little circle of\\nour district, then the province, then Russia, the whole world. Because\\na just idea cannot but be fruitful. Yes, it’s an aim worth working for.\\nAnd its being me, Kostya Levin, who went to a ball in a black tie, and\\nwas refused by the Shtcherbatskaya girl, and who was intrinsically such\\na pitiful, worthless creature—that proves nothing; I feel sure Franklin\\nfelt just as worthless, and he too had no faith in himself, thinking of\\nhimself as a whole. That means nothing. And he too, most likely, had an\\nAgafea Mihalovna to whom he confided his secrets.”\\n\\nMusing on such thoughts Levin reached home in the darkness.\\n\\nThe bailiff, who had been to the merchant, had come back and brought\\npart of the money for the wheat. An agreement had been made with the\\nold servant, and on the road the bailiff had learned that everywhere\\nthe corn was still standing in the fields, so that his one hundred and\\nsixty shocks that had not been carried were nothing in comparison with\\nthe losses of others.\\n\\nAfter dinner Levin was sitting, as he usually did, in an easy chair\\nwith a book, and as he read he went on thinking of the journey before\\nhim in connection with his book. Today all the significance of his book\\nrose before him with special distinctness, and whole periods ranged\\nthemselves in his mind in illustration of his theories. “I must write\\nthat down,” he thought. “That ought to form a brief introduction, which\\nI thought unnecessary before.” He got up to go to his writing-table,\\nand Laska, lying at his feet, got up too, stretching and looking at him\\nas though to inquire where to go. But he had not time to write it down,\\nfor the head peasants had come round, and Levin went out into the hall\\nto them.\\n\\nAfter his levee, that is to say, giving directions about the labors of\\nthe next day, and seeing all the peasants who had business with him,\\nLevin went back to his study and sat down to work.\\n\\nLaska lay under the table; Agafea Mihalovna settled herself in her\\nplace with her stocking.\\n\\nAfter writing for a little while, Levin suddenly thought with\\nexceptional vividness of Kitty, her refusal, and their last meeting. He\\ngot up and began walking about the room.\\n\\n“What’s the use of being dreary?” said Agafea Mihalovna. “Come, why do\\nyou stay on at home? You ought to go to some warm springs, especially\\nnow you’re ready for the journey.”\\n\\n“Well, I am going away the day after tomorrow, Agafea Mihalovna; I must\\nfinish my work.”\\n\\n“There, there, your work, you say! As if you hadn’t done enough for the\\npeasants! Why, as ’tis, they’re saying, ‘Your master will be getting\\nsome honor from the Tsar for it.’ Indeed and it is a strange thing; why\\nneed you worry about the peasants?”\\n\\n“I’m not worrying about them; I’m doing it for my own good.”\\n\\nAgafea Mihalovna knew every detail of Levin’s plans for his land. Levin\\noften put his views before her in all their complexity, and not\\nuncommonly he argued with her and did not agree with her comments. But\\non this occasion she entirely misinterpreted what he had said.\\n\\n“Of one’s soul’s salvation we all know and must think before all else,”\\nshe said with a sigh. “Parfen Denisitch now, for all he was no scholar,\\nhe died a death that God grant everyone of us the like,” she said,\\nreferring to a servant who had died recently. “Took the sacrament and\\nall.”\\n\\n“That’s not what I mean,” said he. “I mean that I’m acting for my own\\nadvantage. It’s all the better for me if the peasants do their work\\nbetter.”\\n\\n“Well, whatever you do, if he’s a lazy good-for-nought, everything’ll\\nbe at sixes and sevens. If he has a conscience, he’ll work, and if not,\\nthere’s no doing anything.”\\n\\n“Oh, come, you say yourself Ivan has begun looking after the cattle\\nbetter.”\\n\\n“All I say is,” answered Agafea Mihalovna, evidently not speaking at\\nrandom, but in strict sequence of idea, “that you ought to get married,\\nthat’s what I say.”\\n\\nAgafea Mihalovna’s allusion to the very subject he had only just been\\nthinking about, hurt and stung him. Levin scowled, and without\\nanswering her, he sat down again to his work, repeating to himself all\\nthat he had been thinking of the real significance of that work. Only\\nat intervals he listened in the stillness to the click of Agafea\\nMihalovna’s needles, and recollecting what he did not want to remember,\\nhe frowned again.\\n\\nAt nine o’clock they heard the bell and the faint vibration of a\\ncarriage over the mud.\\n\\n“Well, here’s visitors come to us, and you won’t be dull,” said Agafea\\nMihalovna, getting up and going to the door. But Levin overtook her.\\nHis work was not going well now, and he was glad of a visitor, whoever\\nit might be 31\\n\\nRunning halfway down the staircase, Levin caught a sound he knew, a\\nfamiliar cough in the hall. But he heard it indistinctly through the\\nsound of his own footsteps, and hoped he was mistaken. Then he caught\\nsight of a long, bony, familiar figure, and now it seemed there was no\\npossibility of mistake; and yet he still went on hoping that this tall\\nman taking off his fur cloak and coughing was not his brother Nikolay.\\n\\nLevin loved his brother, but being with him was always a torture. Just\\nnow, when Levin, under the influence of the thoughts that had come to\\nhim, and Agafea Mihalovna’s hint, was in a troubled and uncertain\\nhumor, the meeting with his brother that he had to face seemed\\nparticularly difficult. Instead of a lively, healthy visitor, some\\noutsider who would, he hoped, cheer him up in his uncertain humor, he\\nhad to see his brother, who knew him through and through, who would\\ncall forth all the thoughts nearest his heart, would force him to show\\nhimself fully. And that he was not disposed to do.\\n\\nAngry with himself for so base a feeling, Levin ran into the hall; as\\nsoon as he had seen his brother close, this feeling of selfish\\ndisappointment vanished instantly and was replaced by pity. Terrible as\\nhis brother Nikolay had been before in his emaciation and sickliness,\\nnow he looked still more emaciated, still more wasted. He was a\\nskeleton covered with skin.\\n\\nHe stood in the hall, jerking his long thin neck, and pulling the scarf\\noff it, and smiled a strange and pitiful smile. When he saw that smile,\\nsubmissive and humble, Levin felt something clutching at his throat.\\n\\n“You see, I’ve come to you,” said Nikolay in a thick voice, never for\\none second taking his eyes off his brother’s face. “I’ve been meaning\\nto a long while, but I’ve been unwell all the time. Now I’m ever so\\nmuch better,” he said, rubbing his beard with his big thin hands.\\n\\n“Yes, yes!” answered Levin. And he felt still more frightened when,\\nkissing him, he felt with his lips the dryness of his brother’s skin\\nand saw close to him his big eyes, full of a strange light.\\n\\nA few weeks before, Konstantin Levin had written to his brother that\\nthrough the sale of the small part of the property, that had remained\\nundivided, there was a sum of about two thousand roubles to come to him\\nas his share.\\n\\nNikolay said that he had come now to take this money and, what was more\\nimportant, to stay a while in the old nest, to get in touch with the\\nearth, so as to renew his strength like the heroes of old for the work\\nthat lay before him. In spite of his exaggerated stoop, and the\\nemaciation that was so striking from his height, his movements were as\\nrapid and abrupt as ever. Levin led him into his study.\\n\\nHis brother dressed with particular care—a thing he never used to\\ndo—combed his scanty, lank hair, and, smiling, went upstairs.\\n\\nHe was in the most affectionate and good-humored mood, just as Levin\\noften remembered him in childhood. He even referred to Sergey\\nIvanovitch without rancor. When he saw Agafea Mihalovna, he made jokes\\nwith her and asked after the old servants. The news of the death of\\nParfen Denisitch made a painful impression on him. A look of fear\\ncrossed his face, but he regained his serenity immediately.\\n\\n“Of course he was quite old,” he said, and changed the subject. “Well,\\nI’ll spend a month or two with you, and then I’m off to Moscow. Do you\\nknow, Myakov has promised me a place there, and I’m going into the\\nservice. Now I’m going to arrange my life quite differently,” he went\\non. “You know I got rid of that woman.”\\n\\n“Marya Nikolaevna? Why, what for?”\\n\\n“Oh, she was a horrid woman! She caused me all sorts of worries.” But\\nhe did not say what the annoyances were. He could not say that he had\\ncast off Marya Nikolaevna because the tea was weak, and, above all,\\nbecause she would look after him, as though he were an invalid.\\n\\n“Besides, I want to turn over a new leaf completely now. I’ve done\\nsilly things, of course, like everyone else, but money’s the last\\nconsideration; I don’t regret it. So long as there’s health, and my\\nhealth, thank God, is quite restored.”\\n\\nLevin listened and racked his brains, but could think of nothing to\\nsay. Nikolay probably felt the same; he began questioning his brother\\nabout his affairs; and Levin was glad to talk about himself, because\\nthen he could speak without hypocrisy. He told his brother of his plans\\nand his doings.\\n\\nHis brother listened, but evidently he was not interested by it.\\n\\nThese two men were so akin, so near each other, that the slightest\\ngesture, the tone of voice, told both more than could be said in words.\\n\\nBoth of them now had only one thought—the illness of Nikolay and the\\nnearness of his death—which stifled all else. But neither of them dared\\nto speak of it, and so whatever they said—not uttering the one thought\\nthat filled their minds—was all falsehood. Never had Levin been so glad\\nwhen the evening was over and it was time to go to bed. Never with any\\noutside person, never on any official visit had he been so unnatural\\nand false as he was that evening. And the consciousness of this\\nunnaturalness, and the remorse he felt at it, made him even more\\nunnatural. He wanted to weep over his dying, dearly loved brother, and\\nhe had to listen and keep on talking of how he meant to live.\\n\\nAs the house was damp, and only one bedroom had been kept heated, Levin\\nput his brother to sleep in his own bedroom behind a screen.\\n\\nHis brother got into bed, and whether he slept or did not sleep, tossed\\nabout like a sick man, coughed, and when he could not get his throat\\nclear, mumbled something. Sometimes when his breathing was painful, he\\nsaid, “Oh, my God!” Sometimes when he was choking he muttered angrily,\\n“Ah, the devil!” Levin could not sleep for a long while, hearing him.\\nHis thoughts were of the most various, but the end of all his thoughts\\nwas the same—death. Death, the inevitable end of all, for the first\\ntime presented itself to him with irresistible force. And death, which\\nwas here in this loved brother, groaning half asleep and from habit\\ncalling without distinction on God and the devil, was not so remote as\\nit had hitherto seemed to him. It was in himself too, he felt that. If\\nnot today, tomorrow, if not tomorrow, in thirty years, wasn’t it all\\nthe same! And what was this inevitable death—he did not know, had never\\nthought about it, and what was more, had not the power, had not the\\ncourage to think about it.\\n\\n“I work, I want to do something, but I had forgotten it must all end; I\\nhad forgotten—death.”\\n\\nHe sat on his bed in the darkness, crouched up, hugging his knees, and\\nholding his breath from the strain of thought, he pondered. But the\\nmore intensely he thought, the clearer it became to him that it was\\nindubitably so, that in reality, looking upon life, he had forgotten\\none little fact—that death will come, and all ends; that nothing was\\neven worth beginning, and that there was no helping it anyway. Yes, it\\nwas awful, but it was so.\\n\\n“But I am alive still. Now what’s to be done? what’s to be done?” he\\nsaid in despair. He lighted a candle, got up cautiously and went to the\\nlooking-glass, and began looking at his face and hair. Yes, there were\\ngray hairs about his temples. He opened his mouth. His back teeth were\\nbeginning to decay. He bared his muscular arms. Yes, there was strength\\nin them. But Nikolay, who lay there breathing with what was left of\\nlungs, had had a strong, healthy body too. And suddenly he recalled how\\nthey used to go to bed together as children, and how they only waited\\ntill Fyodor Bogdanitch was out of the room to fling pillows at each\\nother and laugh, laugh irrepressibly, so that even their awe of Fyodor\\nBogdanitch could not check the effervescing, overbrimming sense of life\\nand happiness. “And now that bent, hollow chest ... and I, not knowing\\nwhat will become of me, or wherefore....”\\n\\n“K...ha! K...ha! Damnation! Why do you keep fidgeting, why don’t you go\\nto sleep?” his brother’s voice called to him.\\n\\n“Oh, I don’t know, I’m not sleepy.”\\n\\n“I have had a good sleep, I’m not in a sweat now. Just see, feel my\\nshirt; it’s not wet, is it?”\\n\\nLevin felt, withdrew behind the screen, and put out the candle, but for\\na long while he could not sleep. The question how to live had hardly\\nbegun to grow a little clearer to him, when a new, insoluble question\\npresented itself—death.\\n\\n“Why, he’s dying—yes, he’ll die in the spring, and how help him? What\\ncan I say to him? What do I know about it? I’d even forgotten that it\\nwas at all 32\\n\\nLevin had long before made the observation that when one is\\nuncomfortable with people from their being excessively amenable and\\nmeek, one is apt very soon after to find things intolerable from their\\ntouchiness and irritability. He felt that this was how it would be with\\nhis brother. And his brother Nikolay’s gentleness did in fact not last\\nout for long. The very next morning he began to be irritable, and\\nseemed doing his best to find fault with his brother, attacking him on\\nhis tenderest points.\\n\\nLevin felt himself to blame, and could not set things right. He felt\\nthat if they had both not kept up appearances, but had spoken, as it is\\ncalled, from the heart—that is to say, had said only just what they\\nwere thinking and feeling—they would simply have looked into each\\nother’s faces, and Konstantin could only have said, “You’re dying,\\nyou’re dying!” and Nikolay could only have answered, “I know I’m dying,\\nbut I’m afraid, I’m afraid, I’m afraid!” And they could have said\\nnothing more, if they had said only what was in their hearts. But life\\nlike that was impossible, and so Konstantin tried to do what he had\\nbeen trying to do all his life, and never could learn to do, though, as\\nfar as he could observe, many people knew so well how to do it, and\\nwithout it there was no living at all. He tried to say what he was not\\nthinking, but he felt continually that it had a ring of falsehood, that\\nhis brother detected him in it, and was exasperated at it.\\n\\nThe third day Nikolay induced his brother to explain his plan to him\\nagain, and began not merely attacking it, but intentionally confounding\\nit with communism.\\n\\n“You’ve simply borrowed an idea that’s not your own, but you’ve\\ndistorted it, and are trying to apply it where it’s not applicable.”\\n\\n“But I tell you it’s nothing to do with it. They deny the justice of\\nproperty, of capital, of inheritance, while I do not deny this chief\\nstimulus.” (Levin felt disgusted himself at using such expressions, but\\never since he had been engrossed by his work, he had unconsciously come\\nmore and more frequently to use words not Russian.) “All I want is to\\nregulate labor.”\\n\\n“Which means, you’ve borrowed an idea, stripped it of all that gave it\\nits force, and want to make believe that it’s something new,” said\\nNikolay, angrily tugging at his necktie.\\n\\n“But my idea has nothing in common....”\\n\\n“That, anyway,” said Nikolay Levin, with an ironical smile, his eyes\\nflashing malignantly, “has the charm of—what’s one to call\\nit?—geometrical symmetry, of clearness, of definiteness. It may be a\\nUtopia. But if once one allows the possibility of making of all the\\npast a _tabula rasa_—no property, no family—then labor would organize\\nitself. But you gain nothing....”\\n\\n“Why do you mix things up? I’ve never been a communist.”\\n\\n“But I have, and I consider it’s premature, but rational, and it has a\\nfuture, just like Christianity in its first ages.”\\n\\n“All that I maintain is that the labor force ought to be investigated\\nfrom the point of view of natural science; that is to say, it ought to\\nbe studied, its qualities ascertained....”\\n\\n“But that’s utter waste of time. That force finds a certain form of\\nactivity of itself, according to the stage of its development. There\\nhave been slaves first everywhere, then metayers; and we have the\\nhalf-crop system, rent, and day laborers. What are you trying to find?”\\n\\nLevin suddenly lost his temper at these words, because at the bottom of\\nhis heart he was afraid that it was true—true that he was trying to\\nhold the balance even between communism and the familiar forms, and\\nthat this was hardly possible.\\n\\n“I am trying to find means of working productively for myself and for\\nthe laborers. I want to organize....” he answered hotly.\\n\\n“You don’t want to organize anything; it’s simply just as you’ve been\\nall your life, that you want to be original to pose as not exploiting\\nthe peasants simply, but with some idea in view.”\\n\\n“Oh, all right, that’s what you think—and let me alone!” answered\\nLevin, feeling the muscles of his left cheek twitching uncontrollably.\\n\\n“You’ve never had, and never have, convictions; all you want is to\\nplease your vanity.”\\n\\n“Oh, very well; then let me alone!”\\n\\n“And I will let you alone! and it’s high time I did, and go to the\\ndevil with you! and I’m very sorry I ever came!”\\n\\nIn spite of all Levin’s efforts to soothe his brother afterwards,\\nNikolay would listen to nothing he said, declaring that it was better\\nto part, and Konstantin saw that it simply was that life was unbearable\\nto him.\\n\\nNikolay was just getting ready to go, when Konstantin went in to him\\nagain and begged him, rather unnaturally, to forgive him if he had hurt\\nhis feelings in any way.\\n\\n“Ah, generosity!” said Nikolay, and he smiled. “If you want to be\\nright, I can give you that satisfaction. You’re in the right; but I’m\\ngoing all the same.”\\n\\nIt was only just at parting that Nikolay kissed him, and said, looking\\nwith sudden strangeness and seriousness at his brother:\\n\\n“Anyway, don’t remember evil against me, Kostya!” and his voice\\nquivered. These were the only words that had been spoken sincerely\\nbetween them. Levin knew that those words meant, “You see, and you\\nknow, that I’m in a bad way, and maybe we shall not see each other\\nagain.” Levin knew this, and the tears gushed from his eyes. He kissed\\nhis brother once more, but he could not speak, and knew not what to\\nsay.\\n\\nThree days after his brother’s departure, Levin too set off for his\\nforeign tour. Happening to meet Shtcherbatsky, Kitty’s cousin, in the\\nrailway train, Levin greatly astonished him by his depression.\\n\\n“What’s the matter with you?” Shtcherbatsky asked him.\\n\\n“Oh, nothing; there’s not much happiness in life.”\\n\\n“Not much? You come with me to Paris instead of to Mulhausen. You shall\\nsee how to be happy.”\\n\\n“No, I’ve done with it all. It’s time I was dead.”\\n\\n“Well, that’s a good one!” said Shtcherbatsky, laughing; “why, I’m only\\njust getting ready to begin.”\\n\\n“Yes, I thought the same not long ago, but now I know I shall soon be\\ndead.”\\n\\nLevin said what he had genuinely been thinking of late. He saw nothing\\nbut death or the advance towards death in everything. But his cherished\\nscheme only engrossed him the more. Life had to be got through somehow\\ntill death did come. Darkness had fallen upon everything for him; but\\njust because of this darkness he felt that the one guiding clue in the\\ndarkness was his work, and he clutched it and clung to it with all his\\nstrength.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPART FOUR 1\\n\\n\\nThe Karenins, husband and wife, continued living in the same house, met\\nevery day, but were complete strangers to one another. Alexey\\nAlexandrovitch made it a rule to see his wife every day, so that the\\nservants might have no grounds for suppositions, but avoided dining at\\nhome. Vronsky was never at Alexey Alexandrovitch’s house, but Anna saw\\nhim away from home, and her husband was aware of it.\\n\\nThe position was one of misery for all three; and not one of them would\\nhave been equal to enduring this position for a single day, if it had\\nnot been for the expectation that it would change, that it was merely a\\ntemporary painful ordeal which would pass over. Alexey Alexandrovitch\\nhoped that this passion would pass, as everything does pass, that\\neveryone would forget about it, and his name would remain unsullied.\\nAnna, on whom the position depended, and for whom it was more miserable\\nthan for anyone, endured it because she not merely hoped, but firmly\\nbelieved, that it would all very soon be settled and come right. She\\nhad not the least idea what would settle the position, but she firmly\\nbelieved that something would very soon turn up now. Vronsky, against\\nhis own will or wishes, followed her lead, hoped too that something,\\napart from his own action, would be sure to solve all difficulties.\\n\\nIn the middle of the winter Vronsky spent a very tiresome week. A\\nforeign prince, who had come on a visit to Petersburg, was put under\\nhis charge, and he had to show him the sights worth seeing. Vronsky was\\nof distinguished appearance; he possessed, moreover, the art of\\nbehaving with respectful dignity, and was used to having to do with\\nsuch grand personages—that was how he came to be put in charge of the\\nprince. But he felt his duties very irksome. The prince was anxious to\\nmiss nothing of which he would be asked at home, had he seen that in\\nRussia? And on his own account he was anxious to enjoy to the utmost\\nall Russian forms of amusement. Vronsky was obliged to be his guide in\\nsatisfying both these inclinations. The mornings they spent driving to\\nlook at places of interest; the evenings they passed enjoying the\\nnational entertainments. The prince rejoiced in health exceptional even\\namong princes. By gymnastics and careful attention to his health he had\\nbrought himself to such a point that in spite of his excess in pleasure\\nhe looked as fresh as a big glossy green Dutch cucumber. The prince had\\ntraveled a great deal, and considered one of the chief advantages of\\nmodern facilities of communication was the accessibility of the\\npleasures of all nations.\\n\\nHe had been in Spain, and there had indulged in serenades and had made\\nfriends with a Spanish girl who played the mandolin. In Switzerland he\\nhad killed chamois. In England he had galloped in a red coat over\\nhedges and killed two hundred pheasants for a bet. In Turkey he had got\\ninto a harem; in India he had hunted on an elephant, and now in Russia\\nhe wished to taste all the specially Russian forms of pleasure.\\n\\nVronsky, who was, as it were, chief master of the ceremonies to him,\\nwas at great pains to arrange all the Russian amusements suggested by\\nvarious persons to the prince. They had race horses, and Russian\\npancakes and bear hunts and three-horse sledges, and gypsies and\\ndrinking feasts, with the Russian accompaniment of broken crockery. And\\nthe prince with surprising ease fell in with the Russian spirit,\\nsmashed trays full of crockery, sat with a gypsy girl on his knee, and\\nseemed to be asking—what more, and does the whole Russian spirit\\nconsist in just this?\\n\\nIn reality, of all the Russian entertainments the prince liked best\\nFrench actresses and ballet dancers and white-seal champagne. Vronsky\\nwas used to princes, but, either because he had himself changed of\\nlate, or that he was in too close proximity to the prince, that week\\nseemed fearfully wearisome to him. The whole of that week he\\nexperienced a sensation such as a man might have set in charge of a\\ndangerous madman, afraid of the madman, and at the same time, from\\nbeing with him, fearing for his own reason. Vronsky was continually\\nconscious of the necessity of never for a second relaxing the tone of\\nstern official respectfulness, that he might not himself be insulted.\\nThe prince’s manner of treating the very people who, to Vronsky’s\\nsurprise, were ready to descend to any depths to provide him with\\nRussian amusements, was contemptuous. His criticisms of Russian women,\\nwhom he wished to study, more than once made Vronsky crimson with\\nindignation. The chief reason why the prince was so particularly\\ndisagreeable to Vronsky was that he could not help seeing himself in\\nhim. And what he saw in this mirror did not gratify his self-esteem. He\\nwas a very stupid and very self-satisfied and very healthy and very\\nwell-washed man, and nothing else. He was a gentleman—that was true,\\nand Vronsky could not deny it. He was equable and not cringing with his\\nsuperiors, was free and ingratiating in his behavior with his equals,\\nand was contemptuously indulgent with his inferiors. Vronsky was\\nhimself the same, and regarded it as a great merit to be so. But for\\nthis prince he was an inferior, and his contemptuous and indulgent\\nattitude to him revolted him.\\n\\n“Brainless beef! can I be like that?” he thought.\\n\\nBe that as it might, when, on the seventh day, he parted from the\\nprince, who was starting for Moscow, and received his thanks, he was\\nhappy to be rid of his uncomfortable position and the unpleasant\\nreflection of himself. He said good-bye to him at the station on their\\nreturn from a bear hunt, at which they had had a display of Russian\\nprowess kept up all night 2\\n\\nWhen he got home, Vronsky found there a note from Anna. She wrote, “I\\nam ill and unhappy. I cannot come out, but I cannot go on longer\\nwithout seeing you. Come in this evening. Alexey Alexandrovitch goes to\\nthe council at seven and will be there till ten.” Thinking for an\\ninstant of the strangeness of her bidding him come straight to her, in\\nspite of her husband’s insisting on her not receiving him, he decided\\nto go.\\n\\nVronsky had that winter got his promotion, was now a colonel, had left\\nthe regimental quarters, and was living alone. After having some lunch,\\nhe lay down on the sofa immediately, and in five minutes memories of\\nthe hideous scenes he had witnessed during the last few days were\\nconfused together and joined on to a mental image of Anna and of the\\npeasant who had played an important part in the bear hunt, and Vronsky\\nfell asleep. He waked up in the dark, trembling with horror, and made\\nhaste to light a candle. “What was it? What? What was the dreadful\\nthing I dreamed? Yes, yes; I think a little dirty man with a disheveled\\nbeard was stooping down doing something, and all of a sudden he began\\nsaying some strange words in French. Yes, there was nothing else in the\\ndream,” he said to himself. “But why was it so awful?” He vividly\\nrecalled the peasant again and those incomprehensible French words the\\npeasant had uttered, and a chill of horror ran down his spine.\\n\\n“What nonsense!” thought Vronsky, and glanced at his watch.\\n\\nIt was half-past eight already. He rang up his servant, dressed in\\nhaste, and went out onto the steps, completely forgetting the dream and\\nonly worried at being late. As he drove up to the Karenins’ entrance he\\nlooked at his watch and saw it was ten minutes to nine. A high, narrow\\ncarriage with a pair of grays was standing at the entrance. He\\nrecognized Anna’s carriage. “She is coming to me,” thought Vronsky,\\n“and better she should. I don’t like going into that house. But no\\nmatter; I can’t hide myself,” he thought, and with that manner peculiar\\nto him from childhood, as of a man who has nothing to be ashamed of,\\nVronsky got out of his sledge and went to the door. The door opened,\\nand the hall-porter with a rug on his arm called the carriage. Vronsky,\\nthough he did not usually notice details, noticed at this moment the\\namazed expression with which the porter glanced at him. In the very\\ndoorway Vronsky almost ran up against Alexey Alexandrovitch. The gas\\njet threw its full light on the bloodless, sunken face under the black\\nhat and on the white cravat, brilliant against the beaver of the coat.\\nKarenin’s fixed, dull eyes were fastened upon Vronsky’s face. Vronsky\\nbowed, and Alexey Alexandrovitch, chewing his lips, lifted his hand to\\nhis hat and went on. Vronsky saw him without looking round get into the\\ncarriage, pick up the rug and the opera-glass at the window and\\ndisappear. Vronsky went into the hall. His brows were scowling, and his\\neyes gleamed with a proud and angry light in them.\\n\\n“What a position!” he thought. “If he would fight, would stand up for\\nhis honor, I could act, could express my feelings; but this weakness or\\nbaseness.... He puts me in the position of playing false, which I never\\nmeant and never mean to do.”\\n\\nVronsky’s ideas had changed since the day of his conversation with Anna\\nin the Vrede garden. Unconsciously yielding to the weakness of Anna—who\\nhad surrendered herself up to him utterly, and simply looked to him to\\ndecide her fate, ready to submit to anything—he had long ceased to\\nthink that their tie might end as he had thought then. His ambitious\\nplans had retreated into the background again, and feeling that he had\\ngot out of that circle of activity in which everything was definite, he\\nhad given himself entirely to his passion, and that passion was binding\\nhim more and more closely to her.\\n\\nHe was still in the hall when he caught the sound of her retreating\\nfootsteps. He knew she had been expecting him, had listened for him,\\nand was now going back to the drawing-room.\\n\\n“No,” she cried, on seeing him, and at the first sound of her voice the\\ntears came into her eyes. “No; if things are to go on like this, the\\nend will come much, much too soon.”\\n\\n“What is it, dear one?”\\n\\n“What? I’ve been waiting in agony for an hour, two hours ... No, I\\nwon’t ... I can’t quarrel with you. Of course you couldn’t come. No, I\\nwon’t.” She laid her two hands on his shoulders, and looked a long\\nwhile at him with a profound, passionate, and at the same time\\nsearching look. She was studying his face to make up for the time she\\nhad not seen him. She was, every time she saw him, making the picture\\nof him in her imagination (incomparably superior, impossible in\\nreality) fit with him as he really was 3\\n\\n“You met him?” she asked, when they had sat down at the table in the\\nlamplight. “You’re punished, you see, for being late.”\\n\\n“Yes; but how was it? Wasn’t he to be at the council?”\\n\\n“He had been and come back, and was going out somewhere again. But\\nthat’s no matter. Don’t talk about it. Where have you been? With the\\nprince still?”\\n\\nShe knew every detail of his existence. He was going to say that he had\\nbeen up all night and had dropped asleep, but looking at her thrilled\\nand rapturous face, he was ashamed. And he said he had had to go to\\nreport on the prince’s departure.\\n\\n“But it’s over now? He is gone?”\\n\\n“Thank God it’s over! You wouldn’t believe how insufferable it’s been\\nfor me.”\\n\\n“Why so? Isn’t it the life all of you, all young men, always lead?” she\\nsaid, knitting her brows; and taking up the crochet work that was lying\\non the table, she began drawing the hook out of it, without looking at\\nVronsky.\\n\\n“I gave that life up long ago,” said he, wondering at the change in her\\nface, and trying to divine its meaning. “And I confess,” he said, with\\na smile, showing his thick, white teeth, “this week I’ve been, as it\\nwere, looking at myself in a glass, seeing that life, and I didn’t like\\nit.”\\n\\nShe held the work in her hands, but did not crochet, and looked at him\\nwith strange, shining, and hostile eyes.\\n\\n“This morning Liza came to see me—they’re not afraid to call on me, in\\nspite of the Countess Lidia Ivanovna,” she put in—“and she told me\\nabout your Athenian evening. How loathsome!”\\n\\n“I was just going to say....”\\n\\nShe interrupted him. “It was that Thérèse you used to know?”\\n\\n“I was just saying....”\\n\\n“How disgusting you are, you men! How is it you can’t understand that a\\nwoman can never forget that,” she said, getting more and more angry,\\nand so letting him see the cause of her irritation, “especially a woman\\nwho cannot know your life? What do I know? What have I ever known?” she\\nsaid, “what you tell me. And how do I know whether you tell me the\\ntruth?...”\\n\\n“Anna, you hurt me. Don’t you trust me? Haven’t I told you that I\\nhaven’t a thought I wouldn’t lay bare to you?”\\n\\n“Yes, yes,” she said, evidently trying to suppress her jealous\\nthoughts. “But if only you knew how wretched I am! I believe you, I\\nbelieve you.... What were you saying?”\\n\\nBut he could not at once recall what he had been going to say. These\\nfits of jealousy, which of late had been more and more frequent with\\nher, horrified him, and however much he tried to disguise the fact,\\nmade him feel cold to her, although he knew the cause of her jealousy\\nwas her love for him. How often he had told himself that her love was\\nhappiness; and now she loved him as a woman can love when love has\\noutweighed for her all the good things of life—and he was much further\\nfrom happiness than when he had followed her from Moscow. Then he had\\nthought himself unhappy, but happiness was before him; now he felt that\\nthe best happiness was already left behind. She was utterly unlike what\\nshe had been when he first saw her. Both morally and physically she had\\nchanged for the worse. She had broadened out all over, and in her face\\nat the time when she was speaking of the actress there was an evil\\nexpression of hatred that distorted it. He looked at her as a man looks\\nat a faded flower he has gathered, with difficulty recognizing in it\\nthe beauty for which he picked and ruined it. And in spite of this he\\nfelt that then, when his love was stronger, he could, if he had greatly\\nwished it, have torn that love out of his heart; but now, when as at\\nthat moment it seemed to him he felt no love for her, he knew that what\\nbound him to her could not be broken.\\n\\n“Well, well, what was it you were going to say about the prince? I have\\ndriven away the fiend,” she added. The fiend was the name they had\\ngiven her jealousy. “What did you begin to tell me about the prince?\\nWhy did you find it so tiresome?”\\n\\n“Oh, it was intolerable!” he said, trying to pick up the thread of his\\ninterrupted thought. “He does not improve on closer acquaintance. If\\nyou want him defined, here he is: a prime, well-fed beast such as takes\\nmedals at the cattle shows, and nothing more,” he said, with a tone of\\nvexation that interested her.\\n\\n“No; how so?” she replied. “He’s seen a great deal, anyway; he’s\\ncultured?”\\n\\n“It’s an utterly different culture—their culture. He’s cultivated, one\\nsees, simply to be able to despise culture, as they despise everything\\nbut animal pleasures.”\\n\\n“But don’t you all care for these animal pleasures?” she said, and\\nagain he noticed a dark look in her eyes that avoided him.\\n\\n“How is it you’re defending him?” he said, smiling.\\n\\n“I’m not defending him, it’s nothing to me; but I imagine, if you had\\nnot cared for those pleasures yourself, you might have got out of them.\\nBut if it affords you satisfaction to gaze at Thérèse in the attire of\\nEve....”\\n\\n“Again, the devil again,” Vronsky said, taking the hand she had laid on\\nthe table and kissing it.\\n\\n“Yes; but I can’t help it. You don’t know what I have suffered waiting\\nfor you. I believe I’m not jealous. I’m not jealous: I believe you when\\nyou’re here; but when you’re away somewhere leading your life, so\\nincomprehensible to me....”\\n\\nShe turned away from him, pulled the hook at last out of the crochet\\nwork, and rapidly, with the help of her forefinger, began working loop\\nafter loop of the wool that was dazzling white in the lamplight, while\\nthe slender wrist moved swiftly, nervously in the embroidered cuff.\\n\\n“How was it, then? Where did you meet Alexey Alexandrovitch?” Her voice\\nsounded in an unnatural and jarring tone.\\n\\n“We ran up against each other in the doorway.”\\n\\n“And he bowed to you like this?”\\n\\nShe drew a long face, and half-closing her eyes, quickly transformed\\nher expression, folded her hands, and Vronsky suddenly saw in her\\nbeautiful face the very expression with which Alexey Alexandrovitch had\\nbowed to him. He smiled, while she laughed gaily, with that sweet, deep\\nlaugh, which was one of her greatest charms.\\n\\n“I don’t understand him in the least,” said Vronsky. “If after your\\navowal to him at your country house he had broken with you, if he had\\ncalled me out—but this I can’t understand. How can he put up with such\\na position? He feels it, that’s evident.”\\n\\n“He?” she said sneeringly. “He’s perfectly satisfied.”\\n\\n“What are we all miserable for, when everything might be so happy?”\\n\\n“Only not he. Don’t I know him, the falsity in which he’s utterly\\nsteeped?... Could one, with any feeling, live as he is living with me?\\nHe understands nothing, and feels nothing. Could a man of any feeling\\nlive in the same house with his unfaithful wife? Could he talk to her,\\ncall her ‘my dear’?”\\n\\nAnd again she could not help mimicking him: “‘Anna, _ma chère_; Anna,\\ndear!’”\\n\\n“He’s not a man, not a human being—he’s a doll! No one knows him; but I\\nknow him. Oh, if I’d been in his place, I’d long ago have killed, have\\ntorn to pieces a wife like me. I wouldn’t have said, ‘Anna, _ma\\nchère_’! He’s not a man, he’s an official machine. He doesn’t\\nunderstand that I’m your wife, that he’s outside, that he’s\\nsuperfluous.... Don’t let’s talk of him!...”\\n\\n“You’re unfair, very unfair, dearest,” said Vronsky, trying to soothe\\nher. “But never mind, don’t let’s talk of him. Tell me what you’ve been\\ndoing? What is the matter? What has been wrong with you, and what did\\nthe doctor say?”\\n\\nShe looked at him with mocking amusement. Evidently she had hit on\\nother absurd and grotesque aspects in her husband and was awaiting the\\nmoment to give expression to them.\\n\\nBut he went on:\\n\\n“I imagine that it’s not illness, but your condition. When will it be?”\\n\\nThe ironical light died away in her eyes, but a different smile, a\\nconsciousness of something, he did not know what, and of quiet\\nmelancholy, came over her face.\\n\\n“Soon, soon. You say that our position is miserable, that we must put\\nan end to it. If you knew how terrible it is to me, what I would give\\nto be able to love you freely and boldly! I should not torture myself\\nand torture you with my jealousy.... And it will come soon, but not as\\nwe expect.”\\n\\nAnd at the thought of how it would come, she seemed so pitiable to\\nherself that tears came into her eyes, and she could not go on. She\\nlaid her hand on his sleeve, dazzling and white with its rings in the\\nlamplight.\\n\\n“It won’t come as we suppose. I didn’t mean to say this to you, but\\nyou’ve made me. Soon, soon, all will be over, and we shall all, all be\\nat peace, and suffer no more.”\\n\\n“I don’t understand,” he said, understanding her.\\n\\n“You asked when? Soon. And I shan’t live through it. Don’t interrupt\\nme!” and she made haste to speak. “I know it; I know for certain. I\\nshall die; and I’m very glad I shall die, and release myself and you.”\\n\\nTears dropped from her eyes; he bent down over her hand and began\\nkissing it, trying to hide his emotion, which, he knew, had no sort of\\ngrounds, though he could not control it.\\n\\n“Yes, it’s better so,” she said, tightly gripping his hand. “That’s the\\nonly way, the only way left us.”\\n\\nHe had recovered himself, and lifted his head.\\n\\n“How absurd! What absurd nonsense you are talking!”\\n\\n“No, it’s the truth.”\\n\\n“What, what’s the truth?”\\n\\n“That I shall die. I have had a dream.”\\n\\n“A dream?” repeated Vronsky, and instantly he recalled the peasant of\\nhis dream.\\n\\n“Yes, a dream,” she said. “It’s a long while since I dreamed it. I\\ndreamed that I ran into my bedroom, that I had to get something there,\\nto find out something; you know how it is in dreams,” she said, her\\neyes wide with horror; “and in the bedroom, in the corner, stood\\nsomething.”\\n\\n“Oh, what nonsense! How can you believe....”\\n\\nBut she would not let him interrupt her. What she was saying was too\\nimportant to her.\\n\\n“And the something turned round, and I saw it was a peasant with a\\ndisheveled beard, little, and dreadful looking. I wanted to run away,\\nbut he bent down over a sack, and was fumbling there with his\\nhands....”\\n\\nShe showed how he had moved his hands. There was terror in her face.\\nAnd Vronsky, remembering his dream, felt the same terror filling his\\nsoul.\\n\\n“He was fumbling and kept talking quickly, quickly in French, you know:\\n_Il faut le battre, le fer, le broyer, le pétrir_.... And in my horror\\nI tried to wake up, and woke up ... but woke up in the dream. And I\\nbegan asking myself what it meant. And Korney said to me: ‘In\\nchildbirth you’ll die, ma’am, you’ll die....’ And I woke up.”\\n\\n“What nonsense, what nonsense!” said Vronsky; but he felt himself that\\nthere was no conviction in his voice.\\n\\n“But don’t let’s talk of it. Ring the bell, I’ll have tea. And stay a\\nlittle now; it’s not long I shall....”\\n\\nBut all at once she stopped. The expression of her face instantaneously\\nchanged. Horror and excitement were suddenly replaced by a look of\\nsoft, solemn, blissful attention. He could not comprehend the meaning\\nof the change. She was listening to the stirring of the new life within\\nher 4\\n\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch, after meeting Vronsky on his own steps, drove,\\nas he had intended, to the Italian opera. He sat through two acts\\nthere, and saw everyone he had wanted to see. On returning home, he\\ncarefully scrutinized the hat stand, and noticing that there was not a\\nmilitary overcoat there, he went, as usual, to his own room. But,\\ncontrary to his usual habit, he did not go to bed, he walked up and\\ndown his study till three o’clock in the morning. The feeling of\\nfurious anger with his wife, who would not observe the proprieties and\\nkeep to the one stipulation he had laid on her, not to receive her\\nlover in her own home, gave him no peace. She had not complied with his\\nrequest, and he was bound to punish her and carry out his threat—obtain\\na divorce and take away his son. He knew all the difficulties connected\\nwith this course, but he had said he would do it, and now he must carry\\nout his threat. Countess Lidia Ivanovna had hinted that this was the\\nbest way out of his position, and of late the obtaining of divorces had\\nbeen brought to such perfection that Alexey Alexandrovitch saw a\\npossibility of overcoming the formal difficulties. Misfortunes never\\ncome singly, and the affairs of the reorganization of the native\\ntribes, and of the irrigation of the lands of the Zaraisky province,\\nhad brought such official worries upon Alexey Alexandrovitch that he\\nhad been of late in a continual condition of extreme irritability.\\n\\nHe did not sleep the whole night, and his fury, growing in a sort of\\nvast, arithmetical progression, reached its highest limits in the\\nmorning. He dressed in haste, and as though carrying his cup full of\\nwrath, and fearing to spill any over, fearing to lose with his wrath\\nthe energy necessary for the interview with his wife, he went into her\\nroom directly he heard she was up.\\n\\nAnna, who had thought she knew her husband so well, was amazed at his\\nappearance when he went in to her. His brow was lowering, and his eyes\\nstared darkly before him, avoiding her eyes; his mouth was tightly and\\ncontemptuously shut. In his walk, in his gestures, in the sound of his\\nvoice there was a determination and firmness such as his wife had never\\nseen in him. He went into her room, and without greeting her, walked\\nstraight up to her writing-table, and taking her keys, opened a drawer.\\n\\n“What do you want?” she cried.\\n\\n“Your lover’s letters,” he said.\\n\\n“They’re not here,” she said, shutting the drawer; but from that action\\nhe saw he had guessed right, and roughly pushing away her hand, he\\nquickly snatched a portfolio in which he knew she used to put her most\\nimportant papers. She tried to pull the portfolio away, but he pushed\\nher back.\\n\\n“Sit down! I have to speak to you,” he said, putting the portfolio\\nunder his arm, and squeezing it so tightly with his elbow that his\\nshoulder stood up. Amazed and intimidated, she gazed at him in silence.\\n\\n“I told you that I would not allow you to receive your lover in this\\nhouse.”\\n\\n“I had to see him to....”\\n\\nShe stopped, not finding a reason.\\n\\n“I do not enter into the details of why a woman wants to see her\\nlover.”\\n\\n“I meant, I only....” she said, flushing hotly. This coarseness of his\\nangered her, and gave her courage. “Surely you must feel how easy it is\\nfor you to insult me?” she said.\\n\\n“An honest man and an honest woman may be insulted, but to tell a thief\\nhe’s a thief is simply _la constatation d’un fait_.”\\n\\n“This cruelty is something new I did not know in you.”\\n\\n“You call it cruelty for a husband to give his wife liberty, giving her\\nthe honorable protection of his name, simply on the condition of\\nobserving the proprieties: is that cruelty?”\\n\\n“It’s worse than cruel—it’s base, if you want to know!” Anna cried, in\\na rush of hatred, and getting up, she was going away.\\n\\n“No!” he shrieked, in his shrill voice, which pitched a note higher\\nthan usual even, and his big hands clutching her by the arm so\\nviolently that red marks were left from the bracelet he was squeezing,\\nhe forcibly sat her down in her place.\\n\\n“Base! If you care to use that word, what is base is to forsake husband\\nand child for a lover, while you eat your husband’s bread!”\\n\\nShe bowed her head. She did not say what she had said the evening\\nbefore to her lover, that _he_ was her husband, and her husband was\\nsuperfluous; she did not even think that. She felt all the justice of\\nhis words, and only said softly:\\n\\n“You cannot describe my position as worse than I feel it to be myself;\\nbut what are you saying all this for?”\\n\\n“What am I saying it for? what for?” he went on, as angrily. “That you\\nmay know that since you have not carried out my wishes in regard to\\nobserving outward decorum, I will take measures to put an end to this\\nstate of things.”\\n\\n“Soon, very soon, it will end, anyway,” she said; and again, at the\\nthought of death near at hand and now desired, tears came into her\\neyes.\\n\\n“It will end sooner than you and your lover have planned! If you must\\nhave the satisfaction of animal passion....”\\n\\n“Alexey Alexandrovitch! I won’t say it’s not generous, but it’s not\\nlike a gentleman to strike anyone who’s down.”\\n\\n“Yes, you only think of yourself! But the sufferings of a man who was\\nyour husband have no interest for you. You don’t care that his whole\\nlife is ruined, that he is thuff ... thuff....”\\n\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch was speaking so quickly that he stammered, and\\nwas utterly unable to articulate the word “suffering.” In the end he\\npronounced it “thuffering.” She wanted to laugh, and was immediately\\nashamed that anything could amuse her at such a moment. And for the\\nfirst time, for an instant, she felt for him, put herself in his place,\\nand was sorry for him. But what could she say or do? Her head sank, and\\nshe sat silent. He too was silent for some time, and then began\\nspeaking in a frigid, less shrill voice, emphasizing random words that\\nhad no special significance.\\n\\n“I came to tell you....” he said.\\n\\nShe glanced at him. “No, it was my fancy,” she thought, recalling the\\nexpression of his face when he stumbled over the word “suffering.” “No;\\ncan a man with those dull eyes, with that self-satisfied complacency,\\nfeel anything?”\\n\\n“I cannot change anything,” she whispered.\\n\\n“I have come to tell you that I am going tomorrow to Moscow, and shall\\nnot return again to this house, and you will receive notice of what I\\ndecide through the lawyer into whose hands I shall intrust the task of\\ngetting a divorce. My son is going to my sister’s,” said Alexey\\nAlexandrovitch, with an effort recalling what he had meant to say about\\nhis son.\\n\\n“You take Seryozha to hurt me,” she said, looking at him from under her\\nbrows. “You do not love him.... Leave me Seryozha!”\\n\\n“Yes, I have lost even my affection for my son, because he is\\nassociated with the repulsion I feel for you. But still I shall take\\nhim. Good-bye!”\\n\\nAnd he was going away, but now she detained him.\\n\\n“Alexey Alexandrovitch, leave me Seryozha!” she whispered once more. “I\\nhave nothing else to say. Leave Seryozha till my ... I shall soon be\\nconfined; leave him!”\\n\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch flew into a rage, and, snatching his hand from\\nher, he went out of the room without a word 5\\n\\nThe waiting-room of the celebrated Petersburg lawyer was full when\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch entered it. Three ladies—an old lady, a young\\nlady, and a merchant’s wife—and three gentlemen—one a German banker\\nwith a ring on his finger, the second a merchant with a beard, and the\\nthird a wrathful-looking government clerk in official uniform, with a\\ncross on his neck—had obviously been waiting a long while already. Two\\nclerks were writing at tables with scratching pens. The appurtenances\\nof the writing-tables, about which Alexey Alexandrovitch was himself\\nvery fastidious, were exceptionally good. He could not help observing\\nthis. One of the clerks, without getting up, turned wrathfully to\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch, half closing his eyes. “What are you wanting?”\\n\\nHe replied that he had to see the lawyer on some business.\\n\\n“He is engaged,” the clerk responded severely, and he pointed with his\\npen at the persons waiting, and went on writing.\\n\\n“Can’t he spare time to see me?” said Alexey Alexandrovitch.\\n\\n“He has no time free; he is always busy. Kindly wait your turn.”\\n\\n“Then I must trouble you to give him my card,” Alexey Alexandrovitch\\nsaid with dignity, seeing the impossibility of preserving his\\nincognito.\\n\\nThe clerk took the card and, obviously not approving of what he read on\\nit, went to the door.\\n\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch was in principle in favor of the publicity of\\nlegal proceedings, though for some higher official considerations he\\ndisliked the application of the principle in Russia, and disapproved of\\nit, as far as he could disapprove of anything instituted by authority\\nof the Emperor. His whole life had been spent in administrative work,\\nand consequently, when he did not approve of anything, his disapproval\\nwas softened by the recognition of the inevitability of mistakes and\\nthe possibility of reform in every department. In the new public law\\ncourts he disliked the restrictions laid on the lawyers conducting\\ncases. But till then he had had nothing to do with the law courts, and\\nso had disapproved of their publicity simply in theory; now his\\ndisapprobation was strengthened by the unpleasant impression made on\\nhim in the lawyer’s waiting room.\\n\\n“Coming immediately,” said the clerk; and two minutes later there did\\nactually appear in the doorway the large figure of an old solicitor who\\nhad been consulting with the lawyer himself.\\n\\nThe lawyer was a little, squat, bald man, with a dark, reddish beard,\\nlight-colored long eyebrows, and an overhanging brow. He was attired as\\nthough for a wedding, from his cravat to his double watch-chain and\\nvarnished boots. His face was clever and manly, but his dress was\\ndandified and in bad taste.\\n\\n“Pray walk in,” said the lawyer, addressing Alexey Alexandrovitch; and,\\ngloomily ushering Karenin in before him, he closed the door.\\n\\n“Won’t you sit down?” He indicated an armchair at a writing-table\\ncovered with papers. He sat down himself, and, rubbing his little hands\\nwith short fingers covered with white hairs, he bent his head on one\\nside. But as soon as he was settled in this position a moth flew over\\nthe table. The lawyer, with a swiftness that could never have been\\nexpected of him, opened his hands, caught the moth, and resumed his\\nformer attitude.\\n\\n“Before beginning to speak of my business,” said Alexey Alexandrovitch,\\nfollowing the lawyer’s movements with wondering eyes, “I ought to\\nobserve that the business about which I have to speak to you is to be\\nstrictly private.”\\n\\nThe lawyer’s overhanging reddish mustaches were parted in a scarcely\\nperceptible smile.\\n\\n“I should not be a lawyer if I could not keep the secrets confided to\\nme. But if you would like proof....”\\n\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch glanced at his face, and saw that the shrewd,\\ngray eyes were laughing, and seemed to know all about it already.\\n\\n“You know my name?” Alexey Alexandrovitch resumed.\\n\\n“I know you and the good”—again he caught a moth—“work you are doing,\\nlike every Russian,” said the lawyer, bowing.\\n\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch sighed, plucking up his courage. But having once\\nmade up his mind he went on in his shrill voice, without timidity—or\\nhesitation, accentuating here and there a word.\\n\\n“I have the misfortune,” Alexey Alexandrovitch began, “to have been\\ndeceived in my married life, and I desire to break off all relations\\nwith my wife by legal means—that is, to be divorced, but to do this so\\nthat my son may not remain with his mother.”\\n\\nThe lawyer’s gray eyes tried not to laugh, but they were dancing with\\nirrepressible glee, and Alexey Alexandrovitch saw that it was not\\nsimply the delight of a man who has just got a profitable job: there\\nwas triumph and joy, there was a gleam like the malignant gleam he saw\\nin his wife’s eyes.\\n\\n“You desire my assistance in securing a divorce?”\\n\\n“Yes, precisely so; but I ought to warn you that I may be wasting your\\ntime and attention. I have come simply to consult you as a preliminary\\nstep. I want a divorce, but the form in which it is possible is of\\ngreat consequence to me. It is very possible that if that form does not\\ncorrespond with my requirements I may give up a legal divorce.”\\n\\n“Oh, that’s always the case,” said the lawyer, “and that’s always for\\nyou to decide.”\\n\\nHe let his eyes rest on Alexey Alexandrovitch’s feet, feeling that he\\nmight offend his client by the sight of his irrepressible amusement. He\\nlooked at a moth that flew before his nose, and moved his hands, but\\ndid not catch it from regard for Alexey Alexandrovitch’s position.\\n\\n“Though in their general features our laws on this subject are known to\\nme,” pursued Alexey Alexandrovitch, “I should be glad to have an idea\\nof the forms in which such things are done in practice.”\\n\\n“You would be glad,” the lawyer, without lifting his eyes, responded,\\nadopting, with a certain satisfaction, the tone of his client’s\\nremarks, “for me to lay before you all the methods by which you could\\nsecure what you desire?”\\n\\nAnd on receiving an assuring nod from Alexey Alexandrovitch, he went\\non, stealing a glance now and then at Alexey Alexandrovitch’s face,\\nwhich was growing red in patches.\\n\\n“Divorce by our laws,” he said, with a slight shade of disapprobation\\nof our laws, “is possible, as you are aware, in the following cases....\\nWait a little!” he called to a clerk who put his head in at the door,\\nbut he got up all the same, said a few words to him, and sat down\\nagain. “... In the following cases: physical defect in the married\\nparties, desertion without communication for five years,” he said,\\ncrooking a short finger covered with hair, “adultery” (this word he\\npronounced with obvious satisfaction), “subdivided as follows” (he\\ncontinued to crook his fat fingers, though the three cases and their\\nsubdivisions could obviously not be classified together): “physical\\ndefect of the husband or of the wife, adultery of the husband or of the\\nwife.” As by now all his fingers were used up, he uncrooked all his\\nfingers and went on: “This is the theoretical view; but I imagine you\\nhave done me the honor to apply to me in order to learn its application\\nin practice. And therefore, guided by precedents, I must inform you\\nthat in practice cases of divorce may all be reduced to the\\nfollowing—there’s no physical defect, I may assume, nor desertion?...”\\n\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch bowed his head in assent.\\n\\n“—May be reduced to the following: adultery of one of the married\\nparties, and the detection in the fact of the guilty party by mutual\\nagreement, and failing such agreement, accidental detection. It must be\\nadmitted that the latter case is rarely met with in practice,” said the\\nlawyer, and stealing a glance at Alexey Alexandrovitch he paused, as a\\nman selling pistols, after enlarging on the advantages of each weapon,\\nmight await his customer’s choice. But Alexey Alexandrovitch said\\nnothing, and therefore the lawyer went on: “The most usual and simple,\\nthe sensible course, I consider, is adultery by mutual consent. I\\nshould not permit myself to express it so, speaking with a man of no\\neducation,” he said, “but I imagine that to you this is\\ncomprehensible.”\\n\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch was, however, so perturbed that he did not\\nimmediately comprehend all the good sense of adultery by mutual\\nconsent, and his eyes expressed this uncertainty; but the lawyer\\npromptly came to his assistance.\\n\\n“People cannot go on living together—here you have a fact. And if both\\nare agreed about it, the details and formalities become a matter of no\\nimportance. And at the same time this is the simplest and most certain\\nmethod.”\\n\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch fully understood now. But he had religious\\nscruples, which hindered the execution of such a plan.\\n\\n“That is out of the question in the present case,” he said. “Only one\\nalternative is possible: undesigned detection, supported by letters\\nwhich I have.”\\n\\nAt the mention of letters the lawyer pursed up his lips, and gave\\nutterance to a thin little compassionate and contemptuous sound.\\n\\n“Kindly consider,” he began, “cases of that kind are, as you are aware,\\nunder ecclesiastical jurisdiction; the reverend fathers are fond of\\ngoing into the minutest details in cases of that kind,” he said with a\\nsmile, which betrayed his sympathy with the reverend fathers’ taste.\\n“Letters may, of course, be a partial confirmation; but detection in\\nthe fact there must be of the most direct kind, that is, by\\neyewitnesses. In fact, if you do me the honor to intrust your\\nconfidence to me, you will do well to leave me the choice of the\\nmeasures to be employed. If one wants the result, one must admit the\\nmeans.”\\n\\n“If it is so....” Alexey Alexandrovitch began, suddenly turning white;\\nbut at that moment the lawyer rose and again went to the door to speak\\nto the intruding clerk.\\n\\n“Tell her we don’t haggle over fees!” he said, and returned to Alexey\\nAlexandrovitch.\\n\\nOn his way back he caught unobserved another moth. “Nice state my rep\\ncurtains will be in by the summer!” he thought, frowning.\\n\\n“And so you were saying?...” he said.\\n\\n“I will communicate my decision to you by letter,” said Alexey\\nAlexandrovitch, getting up, and he clutched at the table. After\\nstanding a moment in silence, he said: “From your words I may\\nconsequently conclude that a divorce may be obtained? I would ask you\\nto let me know what are your terms.”\\n\\n“It may be obtained if you give me complete liberty of action,” said\\nthe lawyer, not answering his question. “When can I reckon on receiving\\ninformation from you?” he asked, moving towards the door, his eyes and\\nhis varnished boots shining.\\n\\n“In a week’s time. Your answer as to whether you will undertake to\\nconduct the case, and on what terms, you will be so good as to\\ncommunicate to me.”\\n\\n“Very good.”\\n\\nThe lawyer bowed respectfully, let his client out of the door, and,\\nleft alone, gave himself up to his sense of amusement. He felt so\\nmirthful that, contrary to his rules, he made a reduction in his terms\\nto the haggling lady, and gave up catching moths, finally deciding that\\nnext winter he must have the furniture covered with velvet, like\\nSigonin’s 6\\n\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch had gained a brilliant victory at the sitting of\\nthe Commission of the 17th of August, but in the sequel this victory\\ncut the ground from under his feet. The new commission for the inquiry\\ninto the condition of the native tribes in all its branches had been\\nformed and despatched to its destination with an unusual speed and\\nenergy inspired by Alexey Alexandrovitch. Within three months a report\\nwas presented. The condition of the native tribes was investigated in\\nits political, administrative, economic, ethnographic, material, and\\nreligious aspects. To all these questions there were answers admirably\\nstated, and answers admitting no shade of doubt, since they were not a\\nproduct of human thought, always liable to error, but were all the\\nproduct of official activity. The answers were all based on official\\ndata furnished by governors and heads of churches, and founded on the\\nreports of district magistrates and ecclesiastical superintendents,\\nfounded in their turn on the reports of parochial overseers and parish\\npriests; and so all of these answers were unhesitating and certain. All\\nsuch questions as, for instance, of the cause of failure of crops, of\\nthe adherence of certain tribes to their ancient beliefs,\\netc.—questions which, but for the convenient intervention of the\\nofficial machine, are not, and cannot be solved for ages—received full,\\nunhesitating solution. And this solution was in favor of Alexey\\nAlexandrovitch’s contention. But Stremov, who had felt stung to the\\nquick at the last sitting, had, on the reception of the commission’s\\nreport, resorted to tactics which Alexey Alexandrovitch had not\\nanticipated. Stremov, carrying with him several members, went over to\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch’s side, and not contenting himself with warmly\\ndefending the measure proposed by Karenin, proposed other more extreme\\nmeasures in the same direction. These measures, still further\\nexaggerated in opposition to what was Alexey Alexandrovitch’s\\nfundamental idea, were passed by the commission, and then the aim of\\nStremov’s tactics became apparent. Carried to an extreme, the measures\\nseemed at once to be so absurd that the highest authorities, and public\\nopinion, and intellectual ladies, and the newspapers, all at the same\\ntime fell foul of them, expressing their indignation both with the\\nmeasures and their nominal father, Alexey Alexandrovitch. Stremov drew\\nback, affecting to have blindly followed Karenin, and to be astounded\\nand distressed at what had been done. This meant the defeat of Alexey\\nAlexandrovitch. But in spite of failing health, in spite of his\\ndomestic griefs, he did not give in. There was a split in the\\ncommission. Some members, with Stremov at their head, justified their\\nmistake on the ground that they had put faith in the commission of\\nrevision, instituted by Alexey Alexandrovitch, and maintained that the\\nreport of the commission was rubbish, and simply so much waste paper.\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch, with a following of those who saw the danger of\\nso revolutionary an attitude to official documents, persisted in\\nupholding the statements obtained by the revising commission. In\\nconsequence of this, in the higher spheres, and even in society, all\\nwas chaos, and although everyone was interested, no one could tell\\nwhether the native tribes really were becoming impoverished and ruined,\\nor whether they were in a flourishing condition. The position of Alexey\\nAlexandrovitch, owing to this, and partly owing to the contempt\\nlavished on him for his wife’s infidelity, became very precarious. And\\nin this position he took an important resolution. To the astonishment\\nof the commission, he announced that he should ask permission to go\\nhimself to investigate the question on the spot. And having obtained\\npermission, Alexey Alexandrovitch prepared to set off to these remote\\nprovinces.\\n\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch’s departure made a great sensation, the more so\\nas just before he started he officially returned the posting-fares\\nallowed him for twelve horses, to drive to his destination.\\n\\n“I think it very noble,” Betsy said about this to the Princess Myakaya.\\n“Why take money for posting-horses when everyone knows that there are\\nrailways everywhere now?”\\n\\nBut Princess Myakaya did not agree, and the Princess Tverskaya’s\\nopinion annoyed her indeed.\\n\\n“It’s all very well for you to talk,” said she, “when you have I don’t\\nknow how many millions; but I am very glad when my husband goes on a\\nrevising tour in the summer. It’s very good for him and pleasant\\ntraveling about, and it’s a settled arrangement for me to keep a\\ncarriage and coachman on the money.”\\n\\nOn his way to the remote provinces Alexey Alexandrovitch stopped for\\nthree days at Moscow.\\n\\nThe day after his arrival he was driving back from calling on the\\ngovernor-general. At the crossroads by Gazetoy Place, where there are\\nalways crowds of carriages and sledges, Alexey Alexandrovitch suddenly\\nheard his name called out in such a loud and cheerful voice that he\\ncould not help looking round. At the corner of the pavement, in a\\nshort, stylish overcoat and a low-crowned fashionable hat, jauntily\\naskew, with a smile that showed a gleam of white teeth and red lips,\\nstood Stepan Arkadyevitch, radiant, young, and beaming. He called him\\nvigorously and urgently, and insisted on his stopping. He had one arm\\non the window of a carriage that was stopping at the corner, and out of\\nthe window were thrust the heads of a lady in a velvet hat, and two\\nchildren. Stepan Arkadyevitch was smiling and beckoning to his\\nbrother-in-law. The lady smiled a kindly smile too, and she too waved\\nher hand to Alexey Alexandrovitch. It was Dolly with her children.\\n\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch did not want to see anyone in Moscow, and least\\nof all his wife’s brother. He raised his hat and would have driven on,\\nbut Stepan Arkadyevitch told his coachman to stop, and ran across the\\nsnow to him.\\n\\n“Well, what a shame not to have let us know! Been here long? I was at\\nDussots’ yesterday and saw ‘Karenin’ on the visitors’ list, but it\\nnever entered my head that it was you,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch,\\nsticking his head in at the window of the carriage, “or I should have\\nlooked you up. I am glad to see you!” he said, knocking one foot\\nagainst the other to shake the snow off. “What a shame of you not to\\nlet us know!” he repeated.\\n\\n“I had no time; I am very busy,” Alexey Alexandrovitch responded dryly.\\n\\n“Come to my wife, she does so want to see you.”\\n\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch unfolded the rug in which his frozen feet were\\nwrapped, and getting out of his carriage made his way over the snow to\\nDarya Alexandrovna.\\n\\n“Why, Alexey Alexandrovitch, what are you cutting us like this for?”\\nsaid Dolly, smiling.\\n\\n“I was very busy. Delighted to see you!” he said in a tone clearly\\nindicating that he was annoyed by it. “How are you?”\\n\\n“Tell me, how is my darling Anna?”\\n\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch mumbled something and would have gone on. But\\nStepan Arkadyevitch stopped him.\\n\\n“I tell you what we’ll do tomorrow. Dolly, ask him to dinner. We’ll ask\\nKoznishev and Pestsov, so as to entertain him with our Moscow\\ncelebrities.”\\n\\n“Yes, please, do come,” said Dolly; “we will expect you at five, or six\\no’clock, if you like. How is my darling Anna? How long....”\\n\\n“She is quite well,” Alexey Alexandrovitch mumbled, frowning.\\n“Delighted!” and he moved away towards his carriage.\\n\\n“You will come?” Dolly called after him.\\n\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch said something which Dolly could not catch in the\\nnoise of the moving carriages.\\n\\n“I shall come round tomorrow!” Stepan Arkadyevitch shouted to him.\\n\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch got into his carriage, and buried himself in it\\nso as neither to see nor be seen.\\n\\n“Queer fish!” said Stepan Arkadyevitch to his wife, and glancing at his\\nwatch, he made a motion of his hand before his face, indicating a\\ncaress to his wife and children, and walked jauntily along the\\npavement.\\n\\n“Stiva! Stiva!” Dolly called, reddening.\\n\\nHe turned round.\\n\\n“I must get coats, you know, for Grisha and Tanya. Give me the money.”\\n\\n“Never mind; you tell them I’ll pay the bill!” and he vanished, nodding\\ngenially to an acquaintance who drove by 7\\n\\nThe next day was Sunday. Stepan Arkadyevitch went to the Grand Theater\\nto a rehearsal of the ballet, and gave Masha Tchibisova, a pretty\\ndancing-girl whom he had just taken under his protection, the coral\\nnecklace he had promised her the evening before, and behind the scenes\\nin the dim daylight of the theater, managed to kiss her pretty little\\nface, radiant over her present. Besides the gift of the necklace he\\nwanted to arrange with her about meeting after the ballet. After\\nexplaining that he could not come at the beginning of the ballet, he\\npromised he would come for the last act and take her to supper. From\\nthe theater Stepan Arkadyevitch drove to Ohotny Row, selected himself\\nthe fish and asparagus for dinner, and by twelve o’clock was at\\nDussots’, where he had to see three people, luckily all staying at the\\nsame hotel: Levin, who had recently come back from abroad and was\\nstaying there; the new head of his department, who had just been\\npromoted to that position, and had come on a tour of revision to\\nMoscow; and his brother-in-law, Karenin, whom he must see, so as to be\\nsure of bringing him to dinner.\\n\\nStepan Arkadyevitch liked dining, but still better he liked to give a\\ndinner, small, but very choice, both as regards the food and drink and\\nas regards the selection of guests. He particularly liked the program\\nof that day’s dinner. There would be fresh perch, asparagus, and _la\\npièce de resistance_—first-rate, but quite plain, roast beef, and wines\\nto suit: so much for the eating and drinking. Kitty and Levin would be\\nof the party, and that this might not be obtrusively evident, there\\nwould be a girl cousin too, and young Shtcherbatsky, and _la pièce de\\nresistance_ among the guests—Sergey Koznishev and Alexey\\nAlexandrovitch. Sergey Ivanovitch was a Moscow man, and a philosopher;\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch a Petersburger, and a practical politician. He\\nwas asking, too, the well-known eccentric enthusiast, Pestsov, a\\nliberal, a great talker, a musician, an historian, and the most\\ndelightfully youthful person of fifty, who would be a sauce or garnish\\nfor Koznishev and Karenin. He would provoke them and set them off.\\n\\nThe second installment for the forest had been received from the\\nmerchant and was not yet exhausted; Dolly had been very amiable and\\ngood-humored of late, and the idea of the dinner pleased Stepan\\nArkadyevitch from every point of view. He was in the most light-hearted\\nmood. There were two circumstances a little unpleasant, but these two\\ncircumstances were drowned in the sea of good-humored gaiety which\\nflooded the soul of Stepan Arkadyevitch. These two circumstances were:\\nfirst, that on meeting Alexey Alexandrovitch the day before in the\\nstreet he had noticed that he was cold and reserved with him, and\\nputting the expression of Alexey Alexandrovitch’s face and the fact\\nthat he had not come to see them or let them know of his arrival with\\nthe rumors he had heard about Anna and Vronsky, Stepan Arkadyevitch\\nguessed that something was wrong between the husband and wife.\\n\\nThat was one disagreeable thing. The other slightly disagreeable fact\\nwas that the new head of his department, like all new heads, had the\\nreputation already of a terrible person, who got up at six o’clock in\\nthe morning, worked like a horse, and insisted on his subordinates\\nworking in the same way. Moreover, this new head had the further\\nreputation of being a bear in his manners, and was, according to all\\nreports, a man of a class in all respects the opposite of that to which\\nhis predecessor had belonged, and to which Stepan Arkadyevitch had\\nhitherto belonged himself. On the previous day Stepan Arkadyevitch had\\nappeared at the office in a uniform, and the new chief had been very\\naffable and had talked to him as to an acquaintance. Consequently\\nStepan Arkadyevitch deemed it his duty to call upon him in his\\nnon-official dress. The thought that the new chief might not tender him\\na warm reception was the other unpleasant thing. But Stepan\\nArkadyevitch instinctively felt that everything would _come round_ all\\nright. “They’re all people, all men, like us poor sinners; why be nasty\\nand quarrelsome?” he thought as he went into the hotel.\\n\\n“Good-day, Vassily,” he said, walking into the corridor with his hat\\ncocked on one side, and addressing a footman he knew; “why, you’ve let\\nyour whiskers grow! Levin, number seven, eh? Take me up, please. And\\nfind out whether Count Anitchkin” (this was the new head) “is\\nreceiving.”\\n\\n“Yes, sir,” Vassily responded, smiling. “You’ve not been to see us for\\na long while.”\\n\\n“I was here yesterday, but at the other entrance. Is this number\\nseven?”\\n\\nLevin was standing with a peasant from Tver in the middle of the room,\\nmeasuring a fresh bearskin, when Stepan Arkadyevitch went in.\\n\\n“What! you killed him?” cried Stepan Arkadyevitch. “Well done! A\\nshe-bear? How are you, Arhip!”\\n\\nHe shook hands with the peasant and sat down on the edge of a chair,\\nwithout taking off his coat and hat.\\n\\n“Come, take off your coat and stay a little,” said Levin, taking his\\nhat.\\n\\n“No, I haven’t time; I’ve only looked in for a tiny second,” answered\\nStepan Arkadyevitch. He threw open his coat, but afterwards did take it\\noff, and sat on for a whole hour, talking to Levin about hunting and\\nthe most intimate subjects.\\n\\n“Come, tell me, please, what you did abroad? Where have you been?” said\\nStepan Arkadyevitch, when the peasant had gone.\\n\\n“Oh, I stayed in Germany, in Prussia, in France, and in England—not in\\nthe capitals, but in the manufacturing towns, and saw a great deal that\\nwas new to me. And I’m glad I went.”\\n\\n“Yes, I knew your idea of the solution of the labor question.”\\n\\n“Not a bit: in Russia there can be no labor question. In Russia the\\nquestion is that of the relation of the working people to the land;\\nthough the question exists there too—but there it’s a matter of\\nrepairing what’s been ruined, while with us....”\\n\\nStepan Arkadyevitch listened attentively to Levin.\\n\\n“Yes, yes!” he said, “it’s very possible you’re right. But I’m glad\\nyou’re in good spirits, and are hunting bears, and working, and\\ninterested. Shtcherbatsky told me another story—he met you—that you\\nwere in such a depressed state, talking of nothing but death....”\\n\\n“Well, what of it? I’ve not given up thinking of death,” said Levin.\\n“It’s true that it’s high time I was dead; and that all this is\\nnonsense. It’s the truth I’m telling you. I do value my idea and my\\nwork awfully; but in reality only consider this: all this world of ours\\nis nothing but a speck of mildew, which has grown up on a tiny planet.\\nAnd for us to suppose we can have something great—ideas, work—it’s all\\ndust and ashes.”\\n\\n“But all that’s as old as the hills, my boy!”\\n\\n“It is old; but do you know, when you grasp this fully, then somehow\\neverything becomes of no consequence. When you understand that you will\\ndie tomorrow, if not today, and nothing will be left, then everything\\nis so unimportant! And I consider my idea very important, but it turns\\nout really to be as unimportant too, even if it were carried out, as\\ndoing for that bear. So one goes on living, amusing oneself with\\nhunting, with work—anything so as not to think of death!”\\n\\nStepan Arkadyevitch smiled a subtle affectionate smile as he listened\\nto Levin.\\n\\n“Well, of course! Here you’ve come round to my point. Do you remember\\nyou attacked me for seeking enjoyment in life? Don’t be so severe, O\\nmoralist!”\\n\\n“No; all the same, what’s fine in life is....” Levin hesitated—“oh, I\\ndon’t know. All I know is that we shall soon be dead.”\\n\\n“Why so soon?”\\n\\n“And do you know, there’s less charm in life, when one thinks of death,\\nbut there’s more peace.”\\n\\n“On the contrary, the finish is always the best. But I must be going,”\\nsaid Stepan Arkadyevitch, getting up for the tenth time.\\n\\n“Oh, no, stay a bit!” said Levin, keeping him. “Now, when shall we see\\neach other again? I’m going tomorrow.”\\n\\n“I’m a nice person! Why, that’s just what I came for! You simply must\\ncome to dinner with us today. Your brother’s coming, and Karenin, my\\nbrother-in-law.”\\n\\n“You don’t mean to say he’s here?” said Levin, and he wanted to inquire\\nabout Kitty. He had heard at the beginning of the winter that she was\\nat Petersburg with her sister, the wife of the diplomat, and he did not\\nknow whether she had come back or not; but he changed his mind and did\\nnot ask. “Whether she’s coming or not, I don’t care,” he said to\\nhimself.\\n\\n“So you’ll come?”\\n\\n“Of course.”\\n\\n“At five o’clock, then, and not evening dress.”\\n\\nAnd Stepan Arkadyevitch got up and went down below to the new head of\\nhis department. Instinct had not misled Stepan Arkadyevitch. The\\nterrible new head turned out to be an extremely amenable person, and\\nStepan Arkadyevitch lunched with him and stayed on, so that it was four\\no’clock before he got to Alexey Alexandrovitch 8\\n\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch, on coming back from church service, had spent\\nthe whole morning indoors. He had two pieces of business before him\\nthat morning; first, to receive and send on a deputation from the\\nnative tribes which was on its way to Petersburg, and now at Moscow;\\nsecondly, to write the promised letter to the lawyer. The deputation,\\nthough it had been summoned at Alexey Alexandrovitch’s instigation, was\\nnot without its discomforting and even dangerous aspect, and he was\\nglad he had found it in Moscow. The members of this deputation had not\\nthe slightest conception of their duty and the part they were to play.\\nThey naïvely believed that it was their business to lay before the\\ncommission their needs and the actual condition of things, and to ask\\nassistance of the government, and utterly failed to grasp that some of\\ntheir statements and requests supported the contention of the enemy’s\\nside, and so spoiled the whole business. Alexey Alexandrovitch was\\nbusily engaged with them for a long while, drew up a program for them\\nfrom which they were not to depart, and on dismissing them wrote a\\nletter to Petersburg for the guidance of the deputation. He had his\\nchief support in this affair in the Countess Lidia Ivanovna. She was a\\nspecialist in the matter of deputations, and no one knew better than\\nshe how to manage them, and put them in the way they should go. Having\\ncompleted this task, Alexey Alexandrovitch wrote the letter to the\\nlawyer. Without the slightest hesitation he gave him permission to act\\nas he might judge best. In the letter he enclosed three of Vronsky’s\\nnotes to Anna, which were in the portfolio he had taken away.\\n\\nSince Alexey Alexandrovitch had left home with the intention of not\\nreturning to his family again, and since he had been at the lawyer’s\\nand had spoken, though only to one man, of his intention, since\\nespecially he had translated the matter from the world of real life to\\nthe world of ink and paper, he had grown more and more used to his own\\nintention, and by now distinctly perceived the feasibility of its\\nexecution.\\n\\nHe was sealing the envelope to the lawyer, when he heard the loud tones\\nof Stepan Arkadyevitch’s voice. Stepan Arkadyevitch was disputing with\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch’s servant, and insisting on being announced.\\n\\n“No matter,” thought Alexey Alexandrovitch, “so much the better. I will\\ninform him at once of my position in regard to his sister, and explain\\nwhy it is I can’t dine with him.”\\n\\n“Come in!” he said aloud, collecting his papers, and putting them in\\nthe blotting-paper.\\n\\n“There, you see, you’re talking nonsense, and he’s at home!” responded\\nStepan Arkadyevitch’s voice, addressing the servant, who had refused to\\nlet him in, and taking off his coat as he went, Oblonsky walked into\\nthe room. “Well, I’m awfully glad I’ve found you! So I hope....” Stepan\\nArkadyevitch began cheerfully.\\n\\n“I cannot come,” Alexey Alexandrovitch said coldly, standing and not\\nasking his visitor to sit down.\\n\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch had thought to pass at once into those frigid\\nrelations in which he ought to stand with the brother of a wife against\\nwhom he was beginning a suit for divorce. But he had not taken into\\naccount the ocean of kindliness brimming over in the heart of Stepan\\nArkadyevitch.\\n\\nStepan Arkadyevitch opened wide his clear, shining eyes.\\n\\n“Why can’t you? What do you mean?” he asked in perplexity, speaking in\\nFrench. “Oh, but it’s a promise. And we’re all counting on you.”\\n\\n“I want to tell you that I can’t dine at your house, because the terms\\nof relationship which have existed between us must cease.”\\n\\n“How? How do you mean? What for?” said Stepan Arkadyevitch with a\\nsmile.\\n\\n“Because I am beginning an action for divorce against your sister, my\\nwife. I ought to have....”\\n\\nBut, before Alexey Alexandrovitch had time to finish his sentence,\\nStepan Arkadyevitch was behaving not at all as he had expected. He\\ngroaned and sank into an armchair.\\n\\n“No, Alexey Alexandrovitch! What are you saying?” cried Oblonsky, and\\nhis suffering was apparent in his face.\\n\\n“It is so.”\\n\\n“Excuse me, I can’t, I can’t believe it!”\\n\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch sat down, feeling that his words had not had the\\neffect he anticipated, and that it would be unavoidable for him to\\nexplain his position, and that, whatever explanations he might make,\\nhis relations with his brother-in-law would remain unchanged.\\n\\n“Yes, I am brought to the painful necessity of seeking a divorce,” he\\nsaid.\\n\\n“I will say one thing, Alexey Alexandrovitch. I know you for an\\nexcellent, upright man; I know Anna—excuse me, I can’t change my\\nopinion of her—for a good, an excellent woman; and so, excuse me, I\\ncannot believe it. There is some misunderstanding,” said he.\\n\\n“Oh, if it were merely a misunderstanding!...”\\n\\n“Pardon, I understand,” interposed Stepan Arkadyevitch. “But of\\ncourse.... One thing: you must not act in haste. You must not, you must\\nnot act in haste!”\\n\\n“I am not acting in haste,” Alexey Alexandrovitch said coldly, “but one\\ncannot ask advice of anyone in such a matter. I have quite made up my\\nmind.”\\n\\n“This is awful!” said Stepan Arkadyevitch. “I would do one thing,\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch. I beseech you, do it!” he said. “No action has\\nyet been taken, if I understand rightly. Before you take advice, see my\\nwife, talk to her. She loves Anna like a sister, she loves you, and\\nshe’s a wonderful woman. For God’s sake, talk to her! Do me that favor,\\nI beseech you!”\\n\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch pondered, and Stepan Arkadyevitch looked at him\\nsympathetically, without interrupting his silence.\\n\\n“You will go to see her?”\\n\\n“I don’t know. That was just why I have not been to see you. I imagine\\nour relations must change.”\\n\\n“Why so? I don’t see that. Allow me to believe that apart from our\\nconnection you have for me, at least in part, the same friendly feeling\\nI have always had for you ... and sincere esteem,” said Stepan\\nArkadyevitch, pressing his hand. “Even if your worst suppositions were\\ncorrect, I don’t—and never would—take on myself to judge either side,\\nand I see no reason why our relations should be affected. But now, do\\nthis, come and see my wife.”\\n\\n“Well, we look at the matter differently,” said Alexey Alexandrovitch\\ncoldly. “However, we won’t discuss it.”\\n\\n“No; why shouldn’t you come today to dine, anyway? My wife’s expecting\\nyou. Please, do come. And, above all, talk it over with her. She’s a\\nwonderful woman. For God’s sake, on my knees, I implore you!”\\n\\n“If you so much wish it, I will come,” said Alexey Alexandrovitch,\\nsighing.\\n\\nAnd, anxious to change the conversation, he inquired about what\\ninterested them both—the new head of Stepan Arkadyevitch’s department,\\na man not yet old, who had suddenly been promoted to so high a\\nposition.\\n\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch had previously felt no liking for Count\\nAnitchkin, and had always differed from him in his opinions. But now,\\nfrom a feeling readily comprehensible to officials—that hatred felt by\\none who has suffered a defeat in the service for one who has received a\\npromotion, he could not endure him.\\n\\n“Well, have you seen him?” said Alexey Alexandrovitch with a malignant\\nsmile.\\n\\n“Of course; he was at our sitting yesterday. He seems to know his work\\ncapitally, and to be very energetic.”\\n\\n“Yes, but what is his energy directed to?” said Alexey Alexandrovitch.\\n“Is he aiming at doing anything, or simply undoing what’s been done?\\nIt’s the great misfortune of our government—this paper administration,\\nof which he’s a worthy representative.”\\n\\n“Really, I don’t know what fault one could find with him. His policy I\\ndon’t know, but one thing—he’s a very nice fellow,” answered Stepan\\nArkadyevitch. “I’ve just been seeing him, and he’s really a capital\\nfellow. We lunched together, and I taught him how to make, you know\\nthat drink, wine and oranges. It’s so cooling. And it’s a wonder he\\ndidn’t know it. He liked it awfully. No, really he’s a capital fellow.”\\n\\nStepan Arkadyevitch glanced at his watch.\\n\\n“Why, good heavens, it’s four already, and I’ve still to go to\\nDolgovushin’s! So please come round to dinner. You can’t imagine how\\nyou will grieve my wife and me.”\\n\\nThe way in which Alexey Alexandrovitch saw his brother-in-law out was\\nvery different from the manner in which he had met him.\\n\\n“I’ve promised, and I’ll come,” he answered wearily.\\n\\n“Believe me, I appreciate it, and I hope you won’t regret it,” answered\\nStepan Arkadyevitch, smiling.\\n\\nAnd, putting on his coat as he went, he patted the footman on the head,\\nchuckled, and went out.\\n\\n“At five o’clock, and not evening dress, please,” he shouted once more,\\nturning at the door 9\\n\\nIt was past five, and several guests had already arrived, before the\\nhost himself got home. He went in together with Sergey Ivanovitch\\nKoznishev and Pestsov, who had reached the street door at the same\\nmoment. These were the two leading representatives of the Moscow\\nintellectuals, as Oblonsky had called them. Both were men respected for\\ntheir character and their intelligence. They respected each other, but\\nwere in complete and hopeless disagreement upon almost every subject,\\nnot because they belonged to opposite parties, but precisely because\\nthey were of the same party (their enemies refused to see any\\ndistinction between their views); but, in that party, each had his own\\nspecial shade of opinion. And since no difference is less easily\\novercome than the difference of opinion about semi-abstract questions,\\nthey never agreed in any opinion, and had long, indeed, been accustomed\\nto jeer without anger, each at the other’s incorrigible aberrations.\\n\\nThey were just going in at the door, talking of the weather, when\\nStepan Arkadyevitch overtook them. In the drawing-room there were\\nalready sitting Prince Alexander Dmitrievitch Shtcherbatsky, young\\nShtcherbatsky, Turovtsin, Kitty, and Karenin.\\n\\nStepan Arkadyevitch saw immediately that things were not going well in\\nthe drawing-room without him. Darya Alexandrovna, in her best gray silk\\ngown, obviously worried about the children, who were to have their\\ndinner by themselves in the nursery, and by her husband’s absence, was\\nnot equal to the task of making the party mix without him. All were\\nsitting like so many priests’ wives on a visit (so the old prince\\nexpressed it), obviously wondering why they were there, and pumping up\\nremarks simply to avoid being silent. Turovtsin—good, simple man—felt\\nunmistakably a fish out of water, and the smile with which his thick\\nlips greeted Stepan Arkadyevitch said, as plainly as words: “Well, old\\nboy, you have popped me down in a learned set! A drinking party now, or\\nthe _Château des Fleurs_, would be more in my line!” The old prince sat\\nin silence, his bright little eyes watching Karenin from one side, and\\nStepan Arkadyevitch saw that he had already formed a phrase to sum up\\nthat politician of whom guests were invited to partake as though he\\nwere a sturgeon. Kitty was looking at the door, calling up all her\\nenergies to keep her from blushing at the entrance of Konstantin Levin.\\nYoung Shtcherbatsky, who had not been introduced to Karenin, was trying\\nto look as though he were not in the least conscious of it. Karenin\\nhimself had followed the Petersburg fashion for a dinner with ladies\\nand was wearing evening dress and a white tie. Stepan Arkadyevitch saw\\nby his face that he had come simply to keep his promise, and was\\nperforming a disagreeable duty in being present at this gathering. He\\nwas indeed the person chiefly responsible for the chill benumbing all\\nthe guests before Stepan Arkadyevitch came in.\\n\\nOn entering the drawing-room Stepan Arkadyevitch apologized, explaining\\nthat he had been detained by that prince, who was always the scapegoat\\nfor all his absences and unpunctualities, and in one moment he had made\\nall the guests acquainted with each other, and, bringing together\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch and Sergey Koznishev, started them on a\\ndiscussion of the Russification of Poland, into which they immediately\\nplunged with Pestsov. Slapping Turovtsin on the shoulder, he whispered\\nsomething comic in his ear, and set him down by his wife and the old\\nprince. Then he told Kitty she was looking very pretty that evening,\\nand presented Shtcherbatsky to Karenin. In a moment he had so kneaded\\ntogether the social dough that the drawing-room became very lively, and\\nthere was a merry buzz of voices. Konstantin Levin was the only person\\nwho had not arrived. But this was so much the better, as going into the\\ndining-room, Stepan Arkadyevitch found to his horror that the port and\\nsherry had been procured from Depré, and not from Levy, and, directing\\nthat the coachman should be sent off as speedily as possible to Levy’s,\\nhe was going back to the drawing-room.\\n\\nIn the dining-room he was met by Konstantin Levin.\\n\\n“I’m not late?”\\n\\n“You can never help being late!” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, taking his\\narm.\\n\\n“Have you a lot of people? Who’s here?” asked Levin, unable to help\\nblushing, as he knocked the snow off his cap with his glove.\\n\\n“All our own set. Kitty’s here. Come along, I’ll introduce you to\\nKarenin.”\\n\\nStepan Arkadyevitch, for all his liberal views, was well aware that to\\nmeet Karenin was sure to be felt a flattering distinction, and so\\ntreated his best friends to this honor. But at that instant Konstantin\\nLevin was not in a condition to feel all the gratification of making\\nsuch an acquaintance. He had not seen Kitty since that memorable\\nevening when he met Vronsky, not counting, that is, the moment when he\\nhad had a glimpse of her on the highroad. He had known at the bottom of\\nhis heart that he would see her here today. But to keep his thoughts\\nfree, he had tried to persuade himself that he did not know it. Now\\nwhen he heard that she was here, he was suddenly conscious of such\\ndelight, and at the same time of such dread, that his breath failed him\\nand he could not utter what he wanted to say.\\n\\n“What is she like, what is she like? Like what she used to be, or like\\nwhat she was in the carriage? What if Darya Alexandrovna told the\\ntruth? Why shouldn’t it be the truth?” he thought.\\n\\n“Oh, please, introduce me to Karenin,” he brought out with an effort,\\nand with a desperately determined step he walked into the drawing-room\\nand beheld her.\\n\\nShe was not the same as she used to be, nor was she as she had been in\\nthe carriage; she was quite different.\\n\\nShe was scared, shy, shame-faced, and still more charming from it. She\\nsaw him the very instant he walked into the room. She had been\\nexpecting him. She was delighted, and so confused at her own delight\\nthat there was a moment, the moment when he went up to her sister and\\nglanced again at her, when she, and he, and Dolly, who saw it all,\\nthought she would break down and would begin to cry. She crimsoned,\\nturned white, crimsoned again, and grew faint, waiting with quivering\\nlips for him to come to her. He went up to her, bowed, and held out his\\nhand without speaking. Except for the slight quiver of her lips and the\\nmoisture in her eyes that made them brighter, her smile was almost calm\\nas she said:\\n\\n“How long it is since we’ve seen each other!” and with desperate\\ndetermination she pressed his hand with her cold hand.\\n\\n“You’ve not seen me, but I’ve seen you,” said Levin, with a radiant\\nsmile of happiness. “I saw you when you were driving from the railway\\nstation to Ergushovo.”\\n\\n“When?” she asked, wondering.\\n\\n“You were driving to Ergushovo,” said Levin, feeling as if he would sob\\nwith the rapture that was flooding his heart. “And how dared I\\nassociate a thought of anything not innocent with this touching\\ncreature? And, yes, I do believe it’s true what Darya Alexandrovna told\\nme,” he thought.\\n\\nStepan Arkadyevitch took him by the arm and led him away to Karenin.\\n\\n“Let me introduce you.” He mentioned their names.\\n\\n“Very glad to meet you again,” said Alexey Alexandrovitch coldly,\\nshaking hands with Levin.\\n\\n“You are acquainted?” Stepan Arkadyevitch asked in surprise.\\n\\n“We spent three hours together in the train,” said Levin smiling, “but\\ngot out, just as in a masquerade, quite mystified—at least I was.”\\n\\n“Nonsense! Come along, please,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, pointing in\\nthe direction of the dining-room.\\n\\nThe men went into the dining-room and went up to a table, laid with six\\nsorts of spirits and as many kinds of cheese, some with little silver\\nspades and some without, caviar, herrings, preserves of various kinds,\\nand plates with slices of French bread.\\n\\nThe men stood round the strong-smelling spirits and salt delicacies,\\nand the discussion of the Russification of Poland between Koznishev,\\nKarenin, and Pestsov died down in anticipation of dinner.\\n\\nSergey Ivanovitch was unequaled in his skill in winding up the most\\nheated and serious argument by some unexpected pinch of Attic salt that\\nchanged the disposition of his opponent. He did this now.\\n\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch had been maintaining that the Russification of\\nPoland could only be accomplished as a result of larger measures which\\nought to be introduced by the Russian government.\\n\\nPestsov insisted that one country can only absorb another when it is\\nthe more densely populated.\\n\\nKoznishev admitted both points, but with limitations. As they were\\ngoing out of the drawing-room to conclude the argument, Koznishev said,\\nsmiling:\\n\\n“So, then, for the Russification of our foreign populations there is\\nbut one method—to bring up as many children as one can. My brother and\\nI are terribly in fault, I see. You married men, especially you, Stepan\\nArkadyevitch, are the real patriots: what number have you reached?” he\\nsaid, smiling genially at their host and holding out a tiny wine-glass\\nto him.\\n\\nEveryone laughed, and Stepan Arkadyevitch with particular good humor.\\n\\n“Oh, yes, that’s the best method!” he said, munching cheese and filling\\nthe wine-glass with a special sort of spirit. The conversation dropped\\nat the jest.\\n\\n“This cheese is not bad. Shall I give you some?” said the master of the\\nhouse. “Why, have you been going in for gymnastics again?” he asked\\nLevin, pinching his muscle with his left hand. Levin smiled, bent his\\narm, and under Stepan Arkadyevitch’s fingers the muscles swelled up\\nlike a sound cheese, hard as a knob of iron, through the fine cloth of\\nthe coat.\\n\\n“What biceps! A perfect Samson!”\\n\\n“I imagine great strength is needed for hunting bears,” observed Alexey\\nAlexandrovitch, who had the mistiest notions about the chase. He cut\\noff and spread with cheese a wafer of bread fine as a spider-web.\\n\\nLevin smiled.\\n\\n“Not at all. Quite the contrary; a child can kill a bear,” he said,\\nwith a slight bow moving aside for the ladies, who were approaching the\\ntable.\\n\\n“You have killed a bear, I’ve been told!” said Kitty, trying\\nassiduously to catch with her fork a perverse mushroom that would slip\\naway, and setting the lace quivering over her white arm. “Are there\\nbears on your place?” she added, turning her charming little head to\\nhim and smiling.\\n\\nThere was apparently nothing extraordinary in what she said, but what\\nunutterable meaning there was for him in every sound, in every turn of\\nher lips, her eyes, her hand as she said it! There was entreaty for\\nforgiveness, and trust in him, and tenderness—soft, timid\\ntenderness—and promise and hope and love for him, which he could not\\nbut believe in and which choked him with happiness.\\n\\n“No, we’ve been hunting in the Tver province. It was coming back from\\nthere that I met your _beau-frère_ in the train, or your _beau-frère’s_\\nbrother-in-law,” he said with a smile. “It was an amusing meeting.”\\n\\nAnd he began telling with droll good-humor how, after not sleeping all\\nnight, he had, wearing an old fur-lined, full-skirted coat, got into\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch’s compartment.\\n\\n“The conductor, forgetting the proverb, would have chucked me out on\\naccount of my attire; but thereupon I began expressing my feelings in\\nelevated language, and ... you, too,” he said, addressing Karenin and\\nforgetting his name, “at first would have ejected me on the ground of\\nthe old coat, but afterwards you took my part, for which I am extremely\\ngrateful.”\\n\\n“The rights of passengers generally to choose their seats are too\\nill-defined,” said Alexey Alexandrovitch, rubbing the tips of his\\nfingers on his handkerchief.\\n\\n“I saw you were in uncertainty about me,” said Levin, smiling\\ngood-naturedly, “but I made haste to plunge into intellectual\\nconversation to smooth over the defects of my attire.” Sergey\\nIvanovitch, while he kept up a conversation with their hostess, had one\\near for his brother, and he glanced askance at him. “What is the matter\\nwith him today? Why such a conquering hero?” he thought. He did not\\nknow that Levin was feeling as though he had grown wings. Levin knew\\nshe was listening to his words and that she was glad to listen to him.\\nAnd this was the only thing that interested him. Not in that room only,\\nbut in the whole world, there existed for him only himself, with\\nenormously increased importance and dignity in his own eyes, and she.\\nHe felt himself on a pinnacle that made him giddy, and far away down\\nbelow were all those nice excellent Karenins, Oblonskys, and all the\\nworld.\\n\\nQuite without attracting notice, without glancing at them, as though\\nthere were no other places left, Stepan Arkadyevitch put Levin and\\nKitty side by side.\\n\\n“Oh, you may as well sit there,” he said to Levin.\\n\\nThe dinner was as choice as the china, in which Stepan Arkadyevitch was\\na connoisseur. The _soupe Marie-Louise_ was a splendid success; the\\ntiny pies eaten with it melted in the mouth and were irreproachable.\\nThe two footmen and Matvey, in white cravats, did their duty with the\\ndishes and wines unobtrusively, quietly, and swiftly. On the material\\nside the dinner was a success; it was no less so on the immaterial. The\\nconversation, at times general and at times between individuals, never\\npaused, and towards the end the company was so lively that the men rose\\nfrom the table, without stopping speaking, and even Alexey\\nAlexandrovitch thawed 10\\n\\nPestsov liked thrashing an argument out to the end, and was not\\nsatisfied with Sergey Ivanovitch’s words, especially as he felt the\\ninjustice of his view.\\n\\n“I did not mean,” he said over the soup, addressing Alexey\\nAlexandrovitch, “mere density of population alone, but in conjunction\\nwith fundamental ideas, and not by means of principles.”\\n\\n“It seems to me,” Alexey Alexandrovitch said languidly, and with no\\nhaste, “that that’s the same thing. In my opinion, influence over\\nanother people is only possible to the people which has the higher\\ndevelopment, which....”\\n\\n“But that’s just the question,” Pestsov broke in in his bass. He was\\nalways in a hurry to speak, and seemed always to put his whole soul\\ninto what he was saying. “In what are we to make higher development\\nconsist? The English, the French, the Germans, which is at the highest\\nstage of development? Which of them will nationalize the other? We see\\nthe Rhine provinces have been turned French, but the Germans are not at\\na lower stage!” he shouted. “There is another law at work there.”\\n\\n“I fancy that the greater influence is always on the side of true\\ncivilization,” said Alexey Alexandrovitch, slightly lifting his\\neyebrows.\\n\\n“But what are we to lay down as the outward signs of true\\ncivilization?” said Pestsov.\\n\\n“I imagine such signs are generally very well known,” said Alexey\\nAlexandrovitch.\\n\\n“But are they fully known?” Sergey Ivanovitch put in with a subtle\\nsmile. “It is the accepted view now that real culture must be purely\\nclassical; but we see most intense disputes on each side of the\\nquestion, and there is no denying that the opposite camp has strong\\npoints in its favor.”\\n\\n“You are for classics, Sergey Ivanovitch. Will you take red wine?” said\\nStepan Arkadyevitch.\\n\\n“I am not expressing my own opinion of either form of culture,” Sergey\\nIvanovitch said, holding out his glass with a smile of condescension,\\nas to a child. “I only say that both sides have strong arguments to\\nsupport them,” he went on, addressing Alexey Alexandrovitch. “My\\nsympathies are classical from education, but in this discussion I am\\npersonally unable to arrive at a conclusion. I see no distinct grounds\\nfor classical studies being given a preeminence over scientific\\nstudies.”\\n\\n“The natural sciences have just as great an educational value,” put in\\nPestsov. “Take astronomy, take botany, or zoology with its system of\\ngeneral principles.”\\n\\n“I cannot quite agree with that,” responded Alexey Alexandrovitch “It\\nseems to me that one must admit that the very process of studying the\\nforms of language has a peculiarly favorable influence on intellectual\\ndevelopment. Moreover, it cannot be denied that the influence of the\\nclassical authors is in the highest degree moral, while, unfortunately,\\nwith the study of the natural sciences are associated the false and\\nnoxious doctrines which are the curse of our day.”\\n\\nSergey Ivanovitch would have said something, but Pestsov interrupted\\nhim in his rich bass. He began warmly contesting the justice of this\\nview. Sergey Ivanovitch waited serenely to speak, obviously with a\\nconvincing reply ready.\\n\\n“But,” said Sergey Ivanovitch, smiling subtly, and addressing Karenin,\\n“One must allow that to weigh all the advantages and disadvantages of\\nclassical and scientific studies is a difficult task, and the question\\nwhich form of education was to be preferred would not have been so\\nquickly and conclusively decided if there had not been in favor of\\nclassical education, as you expressed it just now, its moral—_disons le\\nmot_—anti-nihilist influence.”\\n\\n“Undoubtedly.”\\n\\n“If it had not been for the distinctive property of anti-nihilistic\\ninfluence on the side of classical studies, we should have considered\\nthe subject more, have weighed the arguments on both sides,” said\\nSergey Ivanovitch with a subtle smile, “we should have given elbow-room\\nto both tendencies. But now we know that these little pills of\\nclassical learning possess the medicinal property of anti-nihilism, and\\nwe boldly prescribe them to our patients.... But what if they had no\\nsuch medicinal property?” he wound up humorously.\\n\\nAt Sergey Ivanovitch’s little pills, everyone laughed; Turovtsin in\\nespecial roared loudly and jovially, glad at last to have found\\nsomething to laugh at, all he ever looked for in listening to\\nconversation.\\n\\nStepan Arkadyevitch had not made a mistake in inviting Pestsov. With\\nPestsov intellectual conversation never flagged for an instant.\\nDirectly Sergey Ivanovitch had concluded the conversation with his\\njest, Pestsov promptly started a new one.\\n\\n“I can’t agree even,” said he, “that the government had that aim. The\\ngovernment obviously is guided by abstract considerations, and remains\\nindifferent to the influence its measures may exercise. The education\\nof women, for instance, would naturally be regarded as likely to be\\nharmful, but the government opens schools and universities for women.”\\n\\nAnd the conversation at once passed to the new subject of the education\\nof women.\\n\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch expressed the idea that the education of women is\\napt to be confounded with the emancipation of women, and that it is\\nonly so that it can be considered dangerous.\\n\\n“I consider, on the contrary, that the two questions are inseparably\\nconnected together,” said Pestsov; “it is a vicious circle. Woman is\\ndeprived of rights from lack of education, and the lack of education\\nresults from the absence of rights. We must not forget that the\\nsubjection of women is so complete, and dates from such ages back that\\nwe are often unwilling to recognize the gulf that separates them from\\nus,” said he.\\n\\n“You said rights,” said Sergey Ivanovitch, waiting till Pestsov had\\nfinished, “meaning the right of sitting on juries, of voting, of\\npresiding at official meetings, the right of entering the civil\\nservice, of sitting in parliament....”\\n\\n“Undoubtedly.”\\n\\n“But if women, as a rare exception, can occupy such positions, it seems\\nto me you are wrong in using the expression ‘rights.’ It would be more\\ncorrect to say duties. Every man will agree that in doing the duty of a\\njuryman, a witness, a telegraph clerk, we feel we are performing\\nduties. And therefore it would be correct to say that women are seeking\\nduties, and quite legitimately. And one can but sympathize with this\\ndesire to assist in the general labor of man.”\\n\\n“Quite so,” Alexey Alexandrovitch assented. “The question, I imagine,\\nis simply whether they are fitted for such duties.”\\n\\n“They will most likely be perfectly fitted,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch,\\n“when education has become general among them. We see this....”\\n\\n“How about the proverb?” said the prince, who had a long while been\\nintent on the conversation, his little comical eyes twinkling. “I can\\nsay it before my daughter: her hair is long, because her wit is....”\\n\\n“Just what they thought of the negroes before their emancipation!” said\\nPestsov angrily.\\n\\n“What seems strange to me is that women should seek fresh duties,” said\\nSergey Ivanovitch, “while we see, unhappily, that men usually try to\\navoid them.”\\n\\n“Duties are bound up with rights—power, money, honor; those are what\\nwomen are seeking,” said Pestsov.\\n\\n“Just as though I should seek the right to be a wet-nurse and feel\\ninjured because women are paid for the work, while no one will take\\nme,” said the old prince.\\n\\nTurovtsin exploded in a loud roar of laughter and Sergey Ivanovitch\\nregretted that he had not made this comparison. Even Alexey\\nAlexandrovitch smiled.\\n\\n“Yes, but a man can’t nurse a baby,” said Pestsov, “while a woman....”\\n\\n“No, there was an Englishman who did suckle his baby on board ship,”\\nsaid the old prince, feeling this freedom in conversation permissible\\nbefore his own daughters.\\n\\n“There are as many such Englishmen as there would be women officials,”\\nsaid Sergey Ivanovitch.\\n\\n“Yes, but what is a girl to do who has no family?” put in Stepan\\nArkadyevitch, thinking of Masha Tchibisova, whom he had had in his mind\\nall along, in sympathizing with Pestsov and supporting him.\\n\\n“If the story of such a girl were thoroughly sifted, you would find she\\nhad abandoned a family—her own or a sister’s, where she might have\\nfound a woman’s duties,” Darya Alexandrovna broke in unexpectedly in a\\ntone of exasperation, probably suspecting what sort of girl Stepan\\nArkadyevitch was thinking of.\\n\\n“But we take our stand on principle as the ideal,” replied Pestsov in\\nhis mellow bass. “Woman desires to have rights, to be independent,\\neducated. She is oppressed, humiliated by the consciousness of her\\ndisabilities.”\\n\\n“And I’m oppressed and humiliated that they won’t engage me at the\\nFoundling,” the old prince said again, to the huge delight of\\nTurovtsin, who in his mirth dropped his asparagus with the thick end in\\nthe sauce 11\\n\\nEveryone took part in the conversation except Kitty and Levin. At\\nfirst, when they were talking of the influence that one people has on\\nanother, there rose to Levin’s mind what he had to say on the subject.\\nBut these ideas, once of such importance in his eyes, seemed to come\\ninto his brain as in a dream, and had now not the slightest interest\\nfor him. It even struck him as strange that they should be so eager to\\ntalk of what was of no use to anyone. Kitty, too, should, one would\\nhave supposed, have been interested in what they were saying of the\\nrights and education of women. How often she had mused on the subject,\\nthinking of her friend abroad, Varenka, of her painful state of\\ndependence, how often she had wondered about herself what would become\\nof her if she did not marry, and how often she had argued with her\\nsister about it! But it did not interest her at all. She and Levin had\\na conversation of their own, yet not a conversation, but some sort of\\nmysterious communication, which brought them every moment nearer, and\\nstirred in both a sense of glad terror before the unknown into which\\nthey were entering.\\n\\nAt first Levin, in answer to Kitty’s question how he could have seen\\nher last year in the carriage, told her how he had been coming home\\nfrom the mowing along the highroad and had met her.\\n\\n“It was very, very early in the morning. You were probably only just\\nawake. Your mother was asleep in the corner. It was an exquisite\\nmorning. I was walking along wondering who it could be in a\\nfour-in-hand? It was a splendid set of four horses with bells, and in a\\nsecond you flashed by, and I saw you at the window—you were sitting\\nlike this, holding the strings of your cap in both hands, and thinking\\nawfully deeply about something,” he said, smiling. “How I should like\\nto know what you were thinking about then! Something important?”\\n\\n“Wasn’t I dreadfully untidy?” she wondered, but seeing the smile of\\necstasy these reminiscences called up, she felt that the impression she\\nhad made had been very good. She blushed and laughed with delight;\\n“Really I don’t remember.”\\n\\n“How nicely Turovtsin laughs!” said Levin, admiring his moist eyes and\\nshaking chest.\\n\\n“Have you known him long?” asked Kitty.\\n\\n“Oh, everyone knows him!”\\n\\n“And I see you think he’s a horrid man?”\\n\\n“Not horrid, but nothing in him.”\\n\\n“Oh, you’re wrong! And you must give up thinking so directly!” said\\nKitty. “I used to have a very poor opinion of him too, but he, he’s an\\nawfully nice and wonderfully good-hearted man. He has a heart of gold.”\\n\\n“How could you find out what sort of heart he has?”\\n\\n“We are great friends. I know him very well. Last winter, soon after\\n... you came to see us,” she said, with a guilty and at the same time\\nconfiding smile, “all Dolly’s children had scarlet fever, and he\\nhappened to come and see her. And only fancy,” she said in a whisper,\\n“he felt so sorry for her that he stayed and began to help her look\\nafter the children. Yes, and for three weeks he stopped with them, and\\nlooked after the children like a nurse.”\\n\\n“I am telling Konstantin Dmitrievitch about Turovtsin in the scarlet\\nfever,” she said, bending over to her sister.\\n\\n“Yes, it was wonderful, noble!” said Dolly, glancing towards Turovtsin,\\nwho had become aware they were talking of him, and smiling gently to\\nhim. Levin glanced once more at Turovtsin, and wondered how it was he\\nhad not realized all this man’s goodness before.\\n\\n“I’m sorry, I’m sorry, and I’ll never think ill of people again!” he\\nsaid gaily, genuinely expressing what he felt at the moment 12\\n\\nConnected with the conversation that had sprung up on the rights of\\nwomen there were certain questions as to the inequality of rights in\\nmarriage improper to discuss before the ladies. Pestsov had several\\ntimes during dinner touched upon these questions, but Sergey Ivanovitch\\nand Stepan Arkadyevitch carefully drew him off them.\\n\\nWhen they rose from the table and the ladies had gone out, Pestsov did\\nnot follow them, but addressing Alexey Alexandrovitch, began to expound\\nthe chief ground of inequality. The inequality in marriage, in his\\nopinion, lay in the fact that the infidelity of the wife and the\\ninfidelity of the husband are punished unequally, both by the law and\\nby public opinion. Stepan Arkadyevitch went hurriedly up to Alexey\\nAlexandrovitch and offered him a cigar.\\n\\n“No, I don’t smoke,” Alexey Alexandrovitch answered calmly, and as\\nthough purposely wishing to show that he was not afraid of the subject,\\nhe turned to Pestsov with a chilly smile.\\n\\n“I imagine that such a view has a foundation in the very nature of\\nthings,” he said, and would have gone on to the drawing-room. But at\\nthis point Turovtsin broke suddenly and unexpectedly into the\\nconversation, addressing Alexey Alexandrovitch.\\n\\n“You heard, perhaps, about Pryatchnikov?” said Turovtsin, warmed up by\\nthe champagne he had drunk, and long waiting for an opportunity to\\nbreak the silence that had weighed on him. “Vasya Pryatchnikov,” he\\nsaid, with a good-natured smile on his damp, red lips, addressing\\nhimself principally to the most important guest, Alexey Alexandrovitch,\\n“they told me today he fought a duel with Kvitsky at Tver, and has\\nkilled him.”\\n\\nJust as it always seems that one bruises oneself on a sore place, so\\nStepan Arkadyevitch felt now that the conversation would by ill luck\\nfall every moment on Alexey Alexandrovitch’s sore spot. He would again\\nhave got his brother-in-law away, but Alexey Alexandrovitch himself\\ninquired, with curiosity:\\n\\n“What did Pryatchnikov fight about?”\\n\\n“His wife. Acted like a man, he did! Called him out and shot him!”\\n\\n“Ah!” said Alexey Alexandrovitch indifferently, and lifting his\\neyebrows, he went into the drawing-room.\\n\\n“How glad I am you have come,” Dolly said with a frightened smile,\\nmeeting him in the outer drawing-room. “I must talk to you. Let’s sit\\nhere.”\\n\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch, with the same expression of indifference, given\\nhim by his lifted eyebrows, sat down beside Darya Alexandrovna, and\\nsmiled affectedly.\\n\\n“It’s fortunate,” said he, “especially as I was meaning to ask you to\\nexcuse me, and to be taking leave. I have to start tomorrow.”\\n\\nDarya Alexandrovna was firmly convinced of Anna’s innocence, and she\\nfelt herself growing pale and her lips quivering with anger at this\\nfrigid, unfeeling man, who was so calmly intending to ruin her innocent\\nfriend.\\n\\n“Alexey Alexandrovitch,” she said, with desperate resolution looking\\nhim in the face, “I asked you about Anna, you made me no answer. How is\\nshe?”\\n\\n“She is, I believe, quite well, Darya Alexandrovna,” replied Alexey\\nAlexandrovitch, not looking at her.\\n\\n“Alexey Alexandrovitch, forgive me, I have no right ... but I love Anna\\nas a sister, and esteem her; I beg, I beseech you to tell me what is\\nwrong between you? what fault do you find with her?”\\n\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch frowned, and almost closing his eyes, dropped his\\nhead.\\n\\n“I presume that your husband has told you the grounds on which I\\nconsider it necessary to change my attitude to Anna Arkadyevna?” he\\nsaid, not looking her in the face, but eyeing with displeasure\\nShtcherbatsky, who was walking across the drawing-room.\\n\\n“I don’t believe it, I don’t believe it, I can’t believe it!” Dolly\\nsaid, clasping her bony hands before her with a vigorous gesture. She\\nrose quickly, and laid her hand on Alexey Alexandrovitch’s sleeve. “We\\nshall be disturbed here. Come this way, please.”\\n\\nDolly’s agitation had an effect on Alexey Alexandrovitch. He got up and\\nsubmissively followed her to the schoolroom. They sat down to a table\\ncovered with an oilcloth cut in slits by penknives.\\n\\n“I don’t, I don’t believe it!” Dolly said, trying to catch his glance\\nthat avoided her.\\n\\n“One cannot disbelieve facts, Darya Alexandrovna,” said he, with an\\nemphasis on the word “facts.”\\n\\n“But what has she done?” said Darya Alexandrovna. “What precisely has\\nshe done?”\\n\\n“She has forsaken her duty, and deceived her husband. That’s what she\\nhas done,” said he.\\n\\n“No, no, it can’t be! No, for God’s sake, you are mistaken,” said\\nDolly, putting her hands to her temples and closing her eyes.\\n\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch smiled coldly, with his lips alone, meaning to\\nsignify to her and to himself the firmness of his conviction; but this\\nwarm defense, though it could not shake him, reopened his wound. He\\nbegan to speak with greater heat.\\n\\n“It is extremely difficult to be mistaken when a wife herself informs\\nher husband of the fact—informs him that eight years of her life, and a\\nson, all that’s a mistake, and that she wants to begin life again,” he\\nsaid angrily, with a snort.\\n\\n“Anna and sin—I cannot connect them, I cannot believe it!”\\n\\n“Darya Alexandrovna,” he said, now looking straight into Dolly’s\\nkindly, troubled face, and feeling that his tongue was being loosened\\nin spite of himself, “I would give a great deal for doubt to be still\\npossible. When I doubted, I was miserable, but it was better than now.\\nWhen I doubted, I had hope; but now there is no hope, and still I doubt\\nof everything. I am in such doubt of everything that I even hate my\\nson, and sometimes do not believe he is my son. I am very unhappy.”\\n\\nHe had no need to say that. Darya Alexandrovna had seen that as soon as\\nhe glanced into her face; and she felt sorry for him, and her faith in\\nthe innocence of her friend began to totter.\\n\\n“Oh, this is awful, awful! But can it be true that you are resolved on\\na divorce?”\\n\\n“I am resolved on extreme measures. There is nothing else for me to\\ndo.”\\n\\n“Nothing else to do, nothing else to do....” she replied, with tears in\\nher eyes. “Oh no, don’t say nothing else to do!” she said.\\n\\n“What is horrible in a trouble of this kind is that one cannot, as in\\nany other—in loss, in death—bear one’s trouble in peace, but that one\\nmust act,” said he, as though guessing her thought. “One must get out\\nof the humiliating position in which one is placed; one can’t live _à\\ntrois_.”\\n\\n“I understand, I quite understand that,” said Dolly, and her head sank.\\nShe was silent for a little, thinking of herself, of her own grief in\\nher family, and all at once, with an impulsive movement, she raised her\\nhead and clasped her hands with an imploring gesture. “But wait a\\nlittle! You are a Christian. Think of her! What will become of her, if\\nyou cast her off?”\\n\\n“I have thought, Darya Alexandrovna, I have thought a great deal,” said\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch. His face turned red in patches, and his dim eyes\\nlooked straight before him. Darya Alexandrovna at that moment pitied\\nhim with all her heart. “That was what I did indeed when she herself\\nmade known to me my humiliation; I left everything as of old. I gave\\nher a chance to reform, I tried to save her. And with what result? She\\nwould not regard the slightest request—that she should observe\\ndecorum,” he said, getting heated. “One may save anyone who does not\\nwant to be ruined; but if the whole nature is so corrupt, so depraved,\\nthat ruin itself seems to be her salvation, what’s to be done?”\\n\\n“Anything, only not divorce!” answered Darya Alexandrovna\\n\\n“But what is anything?”\\n\\n“No, it is awful! She will be no one’s wife, she will be lost!”\\n\\n“What can I do?” said Alexey Alexandrovitch, raising his shoulders and\\nhis eyebrows. The recollection of his wife’s last act had so incensed\\nhim that he had become frigid, as at the beginning of the conversation.\\n“I am very grateful for your sympathy, but I must be going,” he said,\\ngetting up.\\n\\n“No, wait a minute. You must not ruin her. Wait a little; I will tell\\nyou about myself. I was married, and my husband deceived me; in anger\\nand jealousy, I would have thrown up everything, I would myself.... But\\nI came to myself again; and who did it? Anna saved me. And here I am\\nliving on. The children are growing up, my husband has come back to his\\nfamily, and feels his fault, is growing purer, better, and I live\\non.... I have forgiven it, and you ought to forgive!”\\n\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch heard her, but her words had no effect on him\\nnow. All the hatred of that day when he had resolved on a divorce had\\nsprung up again in his soul. He shook himself, and said in a shrill,\\nloud voice:\\n\\n“Forgive I cannot, and do not wish to, and I regard it as wrong. I have\\ndone everything for this woman, and she has trodden it all in the mud\\nto which she is akin. I am not a spiteful man, I have never hated\\nanyone, but I hate her with my whole soul, and I cannot even forgive\\nher, because I hate her too much for all the wrong she has done me!” he\\nsaid, with tones of hatred in his voice.\\n\\n“Love those that hate you....” Darya Alexandrovna whispered timorously.\\n\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch smiled contemptuously. That he knew long ago, but\\nit could not be applied to his case.\\n\\n“Love those that hate you, but to love those one hates is impossible.\\nForgive me for having troubled you. Everyone has enough to bear in his\\nown grief!” And regaining his self-possession, Alexey Alexandrovitch\\nquietly took leave and went away 13\\n\\nWhen they rose from table, Levin would have liked to follow Kitty into\\nthe drawing-room; but he was afraid she might dislike this, as too\\nobviously paying her attention. He remained in the little ring of men,\\ntaking part in the general conversation, and without looking at Kitty,\\nhe was aware of her movements, her looks, and the place where she was\\nin the drawing-room.\\n\\nHe did at once, and without the smallest effort, keep the promise he\\nhad made her—always to think well of all men, and to like everyone\\nalways. The conversation fell on the village commune, in which Pestsov\\nsaw a sort of special principle, called by him the “choral” principle.\\nLevin did not agree with Pestsov, nor with his brother, who had a\\nspecial attitude of his own, both admitting and not admitting the\\nsignificance of the Russian commune. But he talked to them, simply\\ntrying to reconcile and soften their differences. He was not in the\\nleast interested in what he said himself, and even less so in what they\\nsaid; all he wanted was that they and everyone should be happy and\\ncontented. He knew now the one thing of importance; and that one thing\\nwas at first there, in the drawing-room, and then began moving across\\nand came to a standstill at the door. Without turning round he felt the\\neyes fixed on him, and the smile, and he could not help turning round.\\nShe was standing in the doorway with Shtcherbatsky, looking at him.\\n\\n“I thought you were going towards the piano,” said he, going up to her.\\n“That’s something I miss in the country—music.”\\n\\n“No; we only came to fetch you and thank you,” she said, rewarding him\\nwith a smile that was like a gift, “for coming. What do they want to\\nargue for? No one ever convinces anyone, you know.”\\n\\n“Yes; that’s true,” said Levin; “it generally happens that one argues\\nwarmly simply because one can’t make out what one’s opponent wants to\\nprove.”\\n\\nLevin had often noticed in discussions between the most intelligent\\npeople that after enormous efforts, and an enormous expenditure of\\nlogical subtleties and words, the disputants finally arrived at being\\naware that what they had so long been struggling to prove to one\\nanother had long ago, from the beginning of the argument, been known to\\nboth, but that they liked different things, and would not define what\\nthey liked for fear of its being attacked. He had often had the\\nexperience of suddenly in a discussion grasping what it was his\\nopponent liked and at once liking it too, and immediately he found\\nhimself agreeing, and then all arguments fell away as useless.\\nSometimes, too, he had experienced the opposite, expressing at last\\nwhat he liked himself, which he was devising arguments to defend, and,\\nchancing to express it well and genuinely, he had found his opponent at\\nonce agreeing and ceasing to dispute his position. He tried to say\\nthis.\\n\\nShe knitted her brow, trying to understand. But directly he began to\\nillustrate his meaning, she understood at once.\\n\\n“I know: one must find out what he is arguing for, what is precious to\\nhim, then one can....”\\n\\nShe had completely guessed and expressed his badly expressed idea.\\nLevin smiled joyfully; he was struck by this transition from the\\nconfused, verbose discussion with Pestsov and his brother to this\\nlaconic, clear, almost wordless communication of the most complex\\nideas.\\n\\nShtcherbatsky moved away from them, and Kitty, going up to a\\ncard-table, sat down, and, taking up the chalk, began drawing diverging\\ncircles over the new green cloth.\\n\\nThey began again on the subject that had been started at dinner—the\\nliberty and occupations of women. Levin was of the opinion of Darya\\nAlexandrovna that a girl who did not marry should find a woman’s duties\\nin a family. He supported this view by the fact that no family can get\\non without women to help; that in every family, poor or rich, there are\\nand must be nurses, either relations or hired.\\n\\n“No,” said Kitty, blushing, but looking at him all the more boldly with\\nher truthful eyes; “a girl may be so circumstanced that she cannot live\\nin the family without humiliation, while she herself....”\\n\\nAt the hint he understood her.\\n\\n“Oh, yes,” he said. “Yes, yes, yes—you’re right; you’re right!”\\n\\nAnd he saw all that Pestsov had been maintaining at dinner of the\\nliberty of woman, simply from getting a glimpse of the terror of an old\\nmaid’s existence and its humiliation in Kitty’s heart; and loving her,\\nhe felt that terror and humiliation, and at once gave up his arguments.\\n\\nA silence followed. She was still drawing with the chalk on the table.\\nHer eyes were shining with a soft light. Under the influence of her\\nmood he felt in all his being a continually growing tension of\\nhappiness.\\n\\n“Ah! I’ve scribbled all over the table!” she said, and, laying down the\\nchalk, she made a movement as though to get up.\\n\\n“What! shall I be left alone—without her?” he thought with horror, and\\nhe took the chalk. “Wait a minute,” he said, sitting down to the table.\\n“I’ve long wanted to ask you one thing.”\\n\\nHe looked straight into her caressing, though frightened eyes.\\n\\n“Please, ask it.”\\n\\n“Here,” he said; and he wrote the initial letters, _w, y, t, m, i, c,\\nn, b, d, t, m, n, o, t_. These letters meant, “When you told me it\\ncould never be, did that mean never, or then?” There seemed no\\nlikelihood that she could make out this complicated sentence; but he\\nlooked at her as though his life depended on her understanding the\\nwords. She glanced at him seriously, then leaned her puckered brow on\\nher hands and began to read. Once or twice she stole a look at him, as\\nthough asking him, “Is it what I think?”\\n\\n“I understand,” she said, flushing a little.\\n\\n“What is this word?” he said, pointing to the _n_ that stood for\\n_never_.\\n\\n“It means _never_,” she said; “but that’s not true!”\\n\\nHe quickly rubbed out what he had written, gave her the chalk, and\\nstood up. She wrote, _t, i, c, n, a, d_.\\n\\nDolly was completely comforted in the depression caused by her\\nconversation with Alexey Alexandrovitch when she caught sight of the\\ntwo figures: Kitty with the chalk in her hand, with a shy and happy\\nsmile looking upwards at Levin, and his handsome figure bending over\\nthe table with glowing eyes fastened one minute on the table and the\\nnext on her. He was suddenly radiant: he had understood. It meant,\\n“Then I could not answer differently.”\\n\\nHe glanced at her questioningly, timidly.\\n\\n“Only then?”\\n\\n“Yes,” her smile answered.\\n\\n“And n... and now?” he asked.\\n\\n“Well, read this. I’ll tell you what I should like—should like so\\nmuch!” she wrote the initial letters, _i, y, c, f, a, f, w, h._ This\\nmeant, “If you could forget and forgive what happened.”\\n\\nHe snatched the chalk with nervous, trembling fingers, and breaking it,\\nwrote the initial letters of the following phrase, “I have nothing to\\nforget and to forgive; I have never ceased to love you.”\\n\\nShe glanced at him with a smile that did not waver.\\n\\n“I understand,” she said in a whisper.\\n\\nHe sat down and wrote a long phrase. She understood it all, and without\\nasking him, “Is it this?” took the chalk and at once answered.\\n\\nFor a long while he could not understand what she had written, and\\noften looked into her eyes. He was stupefied with happiness. He could\\nnot supply the word she had meant; but in her charming eyes, beaming\\nwith happiness, he saw all he needed to know. And he wrote three\\nletters. But he had hardly finished writing when she read them over her\\narm, and herself finished and wrote the answer, “Yes.”\\n\\n“You’re playing _secrétaire_?” said the old prince. “But we must really\\nbe getting along if you want to be in time at the theater.”\\n\\nLevin got up and escorted Kitty to the door.\\n\\nIn their conversation everything had been said; it had been said that\\nshe loved him, and that she would tell her father and mother that he\\nwould come tomorrow morning 14\\n\\nWhen Kitty had gone and Levin was left alone, he felt such uneasiness\\nwithout her, and such an impatient longing to get as quickly, as\\nquickly as possible, to tomorrow morning, when he would see her again\\nand be plighted to her forever, that he felt afraid, as though of\\ndeath, of those fourteen hours that he had to get through without her.\\nIt was essential for him to be with someone to talk to, so as not to be\\nleft alone, to kill time. Stepan Arkadyevitch would have been the\\ncompanion most congenial to him, but he was going out, he said, to a\\n_soirée_, in reality to the ballet. Levin only had time to tell him he\\nwas happy, and that he loved him, and would never, never forget what he\\nhad done for him. The eyes and the smile of Stepan Arkadyevitch showed\\nLevin that he comprehended that feeling fittingly.\\n\\n“Oh, so it’s not time to die yet?” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, pressing\\nLevin’s hand with emotion.\\n\\n“N-n-no!” said Levin.\\n\\nDarya Alexandrovna too, as she said good-bye to him, gave him a sort of\\ncongratulation, saying, “How glad I am you have met Kitty again! One\\nmust value old friends.” Levin did not like these words of Darya\\nAlexandrovna’s. She could not understand how lofty and beyond her it\\nall was, and she ought not to have dared to allude to it. Levin said\\ngood-bye to them, but, not to be left alone, he attached himself to his\\nbrother.\\n\\n“Where are you going?”\\n\\n“I’m going to a meeting.”\\n\\n“Well, I’ll come with you. May I?”\\n\\n“What for? Yes, come along,” said Sergey Ivanovitch, smiling. “What is\\nthe matter with you today?”\\n\\n“With me? Happiness is the matter with me!” said Levin, letting down\\nthe window of the carriage they were driving in. “You don’t mind?—it’s\\nso stifling. It’s happiness is the matter with me! Why is it you have\\nnever married?”\\n\\nSergey Ivanovitch smiled.\\n\\n“I am very glad, she seems a nice gi....” Sergey Ivanovitch was\\nbeginning.\\n\\n“Don’t say it! don’t say it!” shouted Levin, clutching at the collar of\\nhis fur coat with both hands, and muffling him up in it. “She’s a nice\\ngirl” were such simple, humble words, so out of harmony with his\\nfeeling.\\n\\nSergey Ivanovitch laughed outright a merry laugh, which was rare with\\nhim. “Well, anyway, I may say that I’m very glad of it.”\\n\\n“That you may do tomorrow, tomorrow and nothing more! Nothing, nothing,\\nsilence,” said Levin, and muffling him once more in his fur coat, he\\nadded: “I do like you so! Well, is it possible for me to be present at\\nthe meeting?”\\n\\n“Of course it is.”\\n\\n“What is your discussion about today?” asked Levin, never ceasing\\nsmiling.\\n\\nThey arrived at the meeting. Levin heard the secretary hesitatingly\\nread the minutes which he obviously did not himself understand; but\\nLevin saw from this secretary’s face what a good, nice, kind-hearted\\nperson he was. This was evident from his confusion and embarrassment in\\nreading the minutes. Then the discussion began. They were disputing\\nabout the misappropriation of certain sums and the laying of certain\\npipes, and Sergey Ivanovitch was very cutting to two members, and said\\nsomething at great length with an air of triumph; and another member,\\nscribbling something on a bit of paper, began timidly at first, but\\nafterwards answered him very viciously and delightfully. And then\\nSviazhsky (he was there too) said something too, very handsomely and\\nnobly. Levin listened to them, and saw clearly that these missing sums\\nand these pipes were not anything real, and that they were not at all\\nangry, but were all the nicest, kindest people, and everything was as\\nhappy and charming as possible among them. They did no harm to anyone,\\nand were all enjoying it. What struck Levin was that he could see\\nthrough them all today, and from little, almost imperceptible signs\\nknew the soul of each, and saw distinctly that they were all good at\\nheart. And Levin himself in particular they were all extremely fond of\\nthat day. That was evident from the way they spoke to him, from the\\nfriendly, affectionate way even those he did not know looked at him.\\n\\n“Well, did you like it?” Sergey Ivanovitch asked him.\\n\\n“Very much. I never supposed it was so interesting! Capital! Splendid!”\\n\\nSviazhsky went up to Levin and invited him to come round to tea with\\nhim. Levin was utterly at a loss to comprehend or recall what it was he\\nhad disliked in Sviazhsky, what he had failed to find in him. He was a\\nclever and wonderfully good-hearted man.\\n\\n“Most delighted,” he said, and asked after his wife and sister-in-law.\\nAnd from a queer association of ideas, because in his imagination the\\nidea of Sviazhsky’s sister-in-law was connected with marriage, it\\noccurred to him that there was no one to whom he could more suitably\\nspeak of his happiness, and he was very glad to go and see them.\\n\\nSviazhsky questioned him about his improvements on his estate,\\npresupposing, as he always did, that there was no possibility of doing\\nanything not done already in Europe, and now this did not in the least\\nannoy Levin. On the contrary, he felt that Sviazhsky was right, that\\nthe whole business was of little value, and he saw the wonderful\\nsoftness and consideration with which Sviazhsky avoided fully\\nexpressing his correct view. The ladies of the Sviazhsky household were\\nparticularly delightful. It seemed to Levin that they knew all about it\\nalready and sympathized with him, saying nothing merely from delicacy.\\nHe stayed with them one hour, two, three, talking of all sorts of\\nsubjects but the one thing that filled his heart, and did not observe\\nthat he was boring them dreadfully, and that it was long past their\\nbedtime.\\n\\nSviazhsky went with him into the hall, yawning and wondering at the\\nstrange humor his friend was in. It was past one o’clock. Levin went\\nback to his hotel, and was dismayed at the thought that all alone now\\nwith his impatience he had ten hours still left to get through. The\\nservant, whose turn it was to be up all night, lighted his candles, and\\nwould have gone away, but Levin stopped him. This servant, Yegor, whom\\nLevin had noticed before, struck him as a very intelligent, excellent,\\nand, above all, good-hearted man.\\n\\n“Well, Yegor, it’s hard work not sleeping, isn’t it?”\\n\\n“One’s got to put up with it! It’s part of our work, you see. In a\\ngentleman’s house it’s easier; but then here one makes more.”\\n\\nIt appeared that Yegor had a family, three boys and a daughter, a\\nsempstress, whom he wanted to marry to a cashier in a saddler’s shop.\\n\\nLevin, on hearing this, informed Yegor that, in his opinion, in\\nmarriage the great thing was love, and that with love one would always\\nbe happy, for happiness rests only on oneself.\\n\\nYegor listened attentively, and obviously quite took in Levin’s idea,\\nbut by way of assent to it he enunciated, greatly to Levin’s surprise,\\nthe observation that when he had lived with good masters he had always\\nbeen satisfied with his masters, and now was perfectly satisfied with\\nhis employer, though he was a Frenchman.\\n\\n“Wonderfully good-hearted fellow!” thought Levin.\\n\\n“Well, but you yourself, Yegor, when you got married, did you love your\\nwife?”\\n\\n“Ay! and why not?” responded Yegor.\\n\\nAnd Levin saw that Yegor too was in an excited state and intending to\\nexpress all his most heartfelt emotions.\\n\\n“My life, too, has been a wonderful one. From a child up....” he was\\nbeginning with flashing eyes, apparently catching Levin’s enthusiasm,\\njust as people catch yawning.\\n\\nBut at that moment a ring was heard. Yegor departed, and Levin was left\\nalone. He had eaten scarcely anything at dinner, had refused tea and\\nsupper at Sviazhsky’s, but he was incapable of thinking of supper. He\\nhad not slept the previous night, but was incapable of thinking of\\nsleep either. His room was cold, but he was oppressed by heat. He\\nopened both the movable panes in his window and sat down to the table\\nopposite the open panes. Over the snow-covered roofs could be seen a\\ndecorated cross with chains, and above it the rising triangle of\\nCharles’s Wain with the yellowish light of Capella. He gazed at the\\ncross, then at the stars, drank in the fresh freezing air that flowed\\nevenly into the room, and followed as though in a dream the images and\\nmemories that rose in his imagination. At four o’clock he heard steps\\nin the passage and peeped out at the door. It was the gambler Myaskin,\\nwhom he knew, coming from the club. He walked gloomily, frowning and\\ncoughing. “Poor, unlucky fellow!” thought Levin, and tears came into\\nhis eyes from love and pity for this man. He would have talked with\\nhim, and tried to comfort him, but remembering that he had nothing but\\nhis shirt on, he changed his mind and sat down again at the open pane\\nto bathe in the cold air and gaze at the exquisite lines of the cross,\\nsilent, but full of meaning for him, and the mounting lurid yellow\\nstar. At seven o’clock there was a noise of people polishing the\\nfloors, and bells ringing in some servants’ department, and Levin felt\\nthat he was beginning to get frozen. He closed the pane, washed,\\ndressed, and went out into the street 15\\n\\nThe streets were still empty. Levin went to the house of the\\nShtcherbatskys. The visitors’ doors were closed and everything was\\nasleep. He walked back, went into his room again, and asked for coffee.\\nThe day servant, not Yegor this time, brought it to him. Levin would\\nhave entered into conversation with him, but a bell rang for the\\nservant, and he went out. Levin tried to drink coffee and put some roll\\nin his mouth, but his mouth was quite at a loss what to do with the\\nroll. Levin, rejecting the roll, put on his coat and went out again for\\na walk. It was nine o’clock when he reached the Shtcherbatskys’ steps\\nthe second time. In the house they were only just up, and the cook came\\nout to go marketing. He had to get through at least two hours more.\\n\\nAll that night and morning Levin lived perfectly unconsciously, and\\nfelt perfectly lifted out of the conditions of material life. He had\\neaten nothing for a whole day, he had not slept for two nights, had\\nspent several hours undressed in the frozen air, and felt not simply\\nfresher and stronger than ever, but felt utterly independent of his\\nbody; he moved without muscular effort, and felt as if he could do\\nanything. He was convinced he could fly upwards or lift the corner of\\nthe house, if need be. He spent the remainder of the time in the\\nstreet, incessantly looking at his watch and gazing about him.\\n\\nAnd what he saw then, he never saw again after. The children especially\\ngoing to school, the bluish doves flying down from the roofs to the\\npavement, and the little loaves covered with flour, thrust out by an\\nunseen hand, touched him. Those loaves, those doves, and those two boys\\nwere not earthly creatures. It all happened at the same time: a boy ran\\ntowards a dove and glanced smiling at Levin; the dove, with a whir of\\nher wings, darted away, flashing in the sun, amid grains of snow that\\nquivered in the air, while from a little window there came a smell of\\nfresh-baked bread, and the loaves were put out. All of this together\\nwas so extraordinarily nice that Levin laughed and cried with delight.\\nGoing a long way round by Gazetny Place and Kislovka, he went back\\nagain to the hotel, and putting his watch before him, he sat down to\\nwait for twelve o’clock. In the next room they were talking about some\\nsort of machines, and swindling, and coughing their morning coughs.\\nThey did not realize that the hand was near twelve. The hand reached\\nit. Levin went out onto the steps. The sledge-drivers clearly knew all\\nabout it. They crowded round Levin with happy faces, quarreling among\\nthemselves, and offering their services. Trying not to offend the other\\nsledge drivers, and promising to drive with them too, Levin took one\\nand told him to drive to the Shtcherbatskys’. The sledge-driver was\\nsplendid in a white shirt-collar sticking out over his overcoat and\\ninto his strong, full-blooded red neck. The sledge was high and\\ncomfortable, and altogether such a one as Levin never drove in after,\\nand the horse was a good one, and tried to gallop but didn’t seem to\\nmove. The driver knew the Shtcherbatskys’ house, and drew up at the\\nentrance with a curve of his arm and a “Wo!” especially indicative of\\nrespect for his fare. The Shtcherbatskys’ hall-porter certainly knew\\nall about it. This was evident from the smile in his eyes and the way\\nhe said:\\n\\n“Well, it’s a long while since you’ve been to see us, Konstantin\\nDmitrievitch!”\\n\\nNot only he knew all about it, but he was unmistakably delighted and\\nmaking efforts to conceal his joy. Looking into his kindly old eyes,\\nLevin realized even something new in his happiness.\\n\\n“Are they up?”\\n\\n“Pray walk in! Leave it here,” said he, smiling, as Levin would have\\ncome back to take his hat. That meant something.\\n\\n“To whom shall I announce your honor?” asked the footman.\\n\\nThe footman, though a young man, and one of the new school of footmen,\\na dandy, was a very kind-hearted, good fellow, and he too knew all\\nabout it.\\n\\n“The princess ... the prince ... the young princess....” said Levin.\\n\\nThe first person he saw was Mademoiselle Linon. She walked across the\\nroom, and her ringlets and her face were beaming. He had only just\\nspoken to her, when suddenly he heard the rustle of a skirt at the\\ndoor, and Mademoiselle Linon vanished from Levin’s eyes, and a joyful\\nterror came over him at the nearness of his happiness. Mademoiselle\\nLinon was in great haste, and leaving him, went out at the other door.\\nDirectly she had gone out, swift, swift light steps sounded on the\\nparquet, and his bliss, his life, himself—what was best in himself,\\nwhat he had so long sought and longed for—was quickly, so quickly\\napproaching him. She did not walk, but seemed, by some unseen force, to\\nfloat to him. He saw nothing but her clear, truthful eyes, frightened\\nby the same bliss of love that flooded his heart. Those eyes were\\nshining nearer and nearer, blinding him with their light of love. She\\nstopped still close to him, touching him. Her hands rose and dropped\\nonto his shoulders.\\n\\nShe had done all she could—she had run up to him and given herself up\\nentirely, shy and happy. He put his arms round her and pressed his lips\\nto her mouth that sought his kiss.\\n\\nShe too had not slept all night, and had been expecting him all the\\nmorning.\\n\\nHer mother and father had consented without demur, and were happy in\\nher happiness. She had been waiting for him. She wanted to be the first\\nto tell him her happiness and his. She had got ready to see him alone,\\nand had been delighted at the idea, and had been shy and ashamed, and\\ndid not know herself what she was doing. She had heard his steps and\\nvoice, and had waited at the door for Mademoiselle Linon to go.\\nMademoiselle Linon had gone away. Without thinking, without asking\\nherself how and what, she had gone up to him, and did as she was doing.\\n\\n“Let us go to mamma!” she said, taking him by the hand. For a long\\nwhile he could say nothing, not so much because he was afraid of\\ndesecrating the loftiness of his emotion by a word, as that every time\\nhe tried to say something, instead of words he felt that tears of\\nhappiness were welling up. He took her hand and kissed it.\\n\\n“Can it be true?” he said at last in a choked voice. “I can’t believe\\nyou love me, dear!”\\n\\nShe smiled at that “dear,” and at the timidity with which he glanced at\\nher.\\n\\n“Yes!” she said significantly, deliberately. “I am so happy!”\\n\\nNot letting go his hands, she went into the drawing-room. The princess,\\nseeing them, breathed quickly, and immediately began to cry and then\\nimmediately began to laugh, and with a vigorous step Levin had not\\nexpected, ran up to him, and hugging his head, kissed him, wetting his\\ncheeks with her tears.\\n\\n“So it is all settled! I am glad. Love her. I am glad.... Kitty!”\\n\\n“You’ve not been long settling things,” said the old prince, trying to\\nseem unmoved; but Levin noticed that his eyes were wet when he turned\\nto him.\\n\\n“I’ve long, always wished for this!” said the prince, taking Levin by\\nthe arm and drawing him towards himself. “Even when this little\\nfeather-head fancied....”\\n\\n“Papa!” shrieked Kitty, and shut his mouth with her hands.\\n\\n“Well, I won’t!” he said. “I’m very, very ... plea... Oh, what a fool I\\nam....”\\n\\nHe embraced Kitty, kissed her face, her hand, her face again, and made\\nthe sign of the cross over her.\\n\\nAnd there came over Levin a new feeling of love for this man, till then\\nso little known to him, when he saw how slowly and tenderly Kitty\\nkissed his muscular hand 16\\n\\nThe princess sat in her armchair, silent and smiling; the prince sat\\ndown beside her. Kitty stood by her father’s chair, still holding his\\nhand. All were silent.\\n\\nThe princess was the first to put everything into words, and to\\ntranslate all thoughts and feelings into practical questions. And all\\nequally felt this strange and painful for the first minute.\\n\\n“When is it to be? We must have the benediction and announcement. And\\nwhen’s the wedding to be? What do you think, Alexander?”\\n\\n“Here he is,” said the old prince, pointing to Levin—“he’s the\\nprincipal person in the matter.”\\n\\n“When?” said Levin blushing. “Tomorrow. If you ask me, I should say,\\nthe benediction today and the wedding tomorrow.”\\n\\n“Come, _mon cher_, that’s nonsense!”\\n\\n“Well, in a week.”\\n\\n“He’s quite mad.”\\n\\n“No, why so?”\\n\\n“Well, upon my word!” said the mother, smiling, delighted at this\\nhaste. “How about the trousseau?”\\n\\n“Will there really be a trousseau and all that?” Levin thought with\\nhorror. “But can the trousseau and the benediction and all that—can it\\nspoil my happiness? Nothing can spoil it!” He glanced at Kitty, and\\nnoticed that she was not in the least, not in the very least, disturbed\\nby the idea of the trousseau. “Then it must be all right,” he thought.\\n\\n“Oh, I know nothing about it; I only said what I should like,” he said\\napologetically.\\n\\n“We’ll talk it over, then. The benediction and announcement can take\\nplace now. That’s very well.”\\n\\nThe princess went up to her husband, kissed him, and would have gone\\naway, but he kept her, embraced her, and, tenderly as a young lover,\\nkissed her several times, smiling. The old people were obviously\\nmuddled for a moment, and did not quite know whether it was they who\\nwere in love again or their daughter. When the prince and the princess\\nhad gone, Levin went up to his betrothed and took her hand. He was\\nself-possessed now and could speak, and he had a great deal he wanted\\nto tell her. But he said not at all what he had to say.\\n\\n“How I knew it would be so! I never hoped for it; and yet in my heart I\\nwas always sure,” he said. “I believe that it was ordained.”\\n\\n“And I!” she said. “Even when....” She stopped and went on again,\\nlooking at him resolutely with her truthful eyes, “Even when I thrust\\nfrom me my happiness. I always loved you alone, but I was carried away.\\nI ought to tell you.... Can you forgive that?”\\n\\n“Perhaps it was for the best. You will have to forgive me so much. I\\nought to tell you....”\\n\\nThis was one of the things he had meant to speak about. He had resolved\\nfrom the first to tell her two things—that he was not chaste as she\\nwas, and that he was not a believer. It was agonizing, but he\\nconsidered he ought to tell her both these facts.\\n\\n“No, not now, later!” he said.\\n\\n“Very well, later, but you must certainly tell me. I’m not afraid of\\nanything. I want to know everything. Now it is settled.”\\n\\nHe added: “Settled that you’ll take me whatever I may be—you won’t give\\nme up? Yes?”\\n\\n“Yes, yes.”\\n\\nTheir conversation was interrupted by Mademoiselle Linon, who with an\\naffected but tender smile came to congratulate her favorite pupil.\\nBefore she had gone, the servants came in with their congratulations.\\nThen relations arrived, and there began that state of blissful\\nabsurdity from which Levin did not emerge till the day after his\\nwedding. Levin was in a continual state of awkwardness and discomfort,\\nbut the intensity of his happiness went on all the while increasing. He\\nfelt continually that a great deal was being expected of him—what, he\\ndid not know; and he did everything he was told, and it all gave him\\nhappiness. He had thought his engagement would have nothing about it\\nlike others, that the ordinary conditions of engaged couples would\\nspoil his special happiness; but it ended in his doing exactly as other\\npeople did, and his happiness being only increased thereby and becoming\\nmore and more special, more and more unlike anything that had ever\\nhappened.\\n\\n“Now we shall have sweetmeats to eat,” said Mademoiselle Linon—and\\nLevin drove off to buy sweetmeats.\\n\\n“Well, I’m very glad,” said Sviazhsky. “I advise you to get the\\nbouquets from Fomin’s.”\\n\\n“Oh, are they wanted?” And he drove to Fomin’s.\\n\\nHis brother offered to lend him money, as he would have so many\\nexpenses, presents to give....\\n\\n“Oh, are presents wanted?” And he galloped to Foulde’s.\\n\\nAnd at the confectioner’s, and at Fomin’s, and at Foulde’s he saw that\\nhe was expected; that they were pleased to see him, and prided\\nthemselves on his happiness, just as everyone whom he had to do with\\nduring those days. What was extraordinary was that everyone not only\\nliked him, but even people previously unsympathetic, cold, and callous,\\nwere enthusiastic over him, gave way to him in everything, treated his\\nfeeling with tenderness and delicacy, and shared his conviction that he\\nwas the happiest man in the world because his betrothed was beyond\\nperfection. Kitty too felt the same thing. When Countess Nordston\\nventured to hint that she had hoped for something better, Kitty was so\\nangry and proved so conclusively that nothing in the world could be\\nbetter than Levin, that Countess Nordston had to admit it, and in\\nKitty’s presence never met Levin without a smile of ecstatic\\nadmiration.\\n\\nThe confession he had promised was the one painful incident of this\\ntime. He consulted the old prince, and with his sanction gave Kitty his\\ndiary, in which there was written the confession that tortured him. He\\nhad written this diary at the time with a view to his future wife. Two\\nthings caused him anguish: his lack of purity and his lack of faith.\\nHis confession of unbelief passed unnoticed. She was religious, had\\nnever doubted the truths of religion, but his external unbelief did not\\naffect her in the least. Through love she knew all his soul, and in his\\nsoul she saw what she wanted, and that such a state of soul should be\\ncalled unbelieving was to her a matter of no account. The other\\nconfession set her weeping bitterly.\\n\\nLevin, not without an inner struggle, handed her his diary. He knew\\nthat between him and her there could not be, and should not be,\\nsecrets, and so he had decided that so it must be. But he had not\\nrealized what an effect it would have on her, he had not put himself in\\nher place. It was only when the same evening he came to their house\\nbefore the theater, went into her room and saw her tear-stained,\\npitiful, sweet face, miserable with suffering he had caused and nothing\\ncould undo, he felt the abyss that separated his shameful past from her\\ndovelike purity, and was appalled at what he had done.\\n\\n“Take them, take these dreadful books!” she said, pushing away the\\nnotebooks lying before her on the table. “Why did you give them me? No,\\nit was better anyway,” she added, touched by his despairing face. “But\\nit’s awful, awful!”\\n\\nHis head sank, and he was silent. He could say nothing.\\n\\n“You can’t forgive me,” he whispered.\\n\\n“Yes, I forgive you; but it’s terrible!”\\n\\nBut his happiness was so immense that this confession did not shatter\\nit, it only added another shade to it. She forgave him; but from that\\ntime more than ever he considered himself unworthy of her, morally\\nbowed down lower than ever before her, and prized more highly than ever\\nhis undeserved happiness 17\\n\\nUnconsciously going over in his memory the conversations that had taken\\nplace during and after dinner, Alexey Alexandrovitch returned to his\\nsolitary room. Darya Alexandrovna’s words about forgiveness had aroused\\nin him nothing but annoyance. The applicability or non-applicability of\\nthe Christian precept to his own case was too difficult a question to\\nbe discussed lightly, and this question had long ago been answered by\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch in the negative. Of all that had been said, what\\nstuck most in his memory was the phrase of stupid, good-natured\\nTurovtsin—“_Acted like a man, he did! Called him out and shot him!_”\\nEveryone had apparently shared this feeling, though from politeness\\nthey had not expressed it.\\n\\n“But the matter is settled, it’s useless thinking about it,” Alexey\\nAlexandrovitch told himself. And thinking of nothing but the journey\\nbefore him, and the revision work he had to do, he went into his room\\nand asked the porter who escorted him where his man was. The porter\\nsaid that the man had only just gone out. Alexey Alexandrovitch ordered\\ntea to be sent him, sat down to the table, and taking the guidebook,\\nbegan considering the route of his journey.\\n\\n“Two telegrams,” said his manservant, coming into the room. “I beg your\\npardon, your excellency; I’d only just that minute gone out.”\\n\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch took the telegrams and opened them. The first\\ntelegram was the announcement of Stremov’s appointment to the very post\\nKarenin had coveted. Alexey Alexandrovitch flung the telegram down, and\\nflushing a little, got up and began to pace up and down the room.\\n“_Quos vult perdere dementat_,” he said, meaning by _quos_ the persons\\nresponsible for this appointment. He was not so much annoyed that he\\nhad not received the post, that he had been conspicuously passed over;\\nbut it was incomprehensible, amazing to him that they did not see that\\nthe wordy phrase-monger Stremov was the last man fit for it. How could\\nthey fail to see how they were ruining themselves, lowering their\\n_prestige_ by this appointment?\\n\\n“Something else in the same line,” he said to himself bitterly, opening\\nthe second telegram. The telegram was from his wife. Her name, written\\nin blue pencil, “Anna,” was the first thing that caught his eye. “I am\\ndying; I beg, I implore you to come. I shall die easier with your\\nforgiveness,” he read. He smiled contemptuously, and flung down the\\ntelegram. That this was a trick and a fraud, of that, he thought for\\nthe first minute, there could be no doubt.\\n\\n“There is no deceit she would stick at. She was near her confinement.\\nPerhaps it is the confinement. But what can be their aim? To legitimize\\nthe child, to compromise me, and prevent a divorce,” he thought. “But\\nsomething was said in it: I am dying....” He read the telegram again,\\nand suddenly the plain meaning of what was said in it struck him.\\n\\n“And if it is true?” he said to himself. “If it is true that in the\\nmoment of agony and nearness to death she is genuinely penitent, and I,\\ntaking it for a trick, refuse to go? That would not only be cruel, and\\neveryone would blame me, but it would be stupid on my part.”\\n\\n“Piotr, call a coach; I am going to Petersburg,” he said to his\\nservant.\\n\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch decided that he would go to Petersburg and see\\nhis wife. If her illness was a trick, he would say nothing and go away\\nagain. If she was really in danger, and wished to see him before her\\ndeath, he would forgive her if he found her alive, and pay her the last\\nduties if he came too late.\\n\\nAll the way he thought no more of what he ought to do.\\n\\nWith a sense of weariness and uncleanness from the night spent in the\\ntrain, in the early fog of Petersburg Alexey Alexandrovitch drove\\nthrough the deserted Nevsky and stared straight before him, not\\nthinking of what was awaiting him. He could not think about it, because\\nin picturing what would happen, he could not drive away the reflection\\nthat her death would at once remove all the difficulty of his position.\\nBakers, closed shops, night-cabmen, porters sweeping the pavements\\nflashed past his eyes, and he watched it all, trying to smother the\\nthought of what was awaiting him, and what he dared not hope for, and\\nyet was hoping for. He drove up to the steps. A sledge and a carriage\\nwith the coachman asleep stood at the entrance. As he went into the\\nentry, Alexey Alexandrovitch, as it were, got out his resolution from\\nthe remotest corner of his brain, and mastered it thoroughly. Its\\nmeaning ran: “If it’s a trick, then calm contempt and departure. If\\ntruth, do what is proper.”\\n\\nThe porter opened the door before Alexey Alexandrovitch rang. The\\nporter, Kapitonitch, looked queer in an old coat, without a tie, and in\\nslippers.\\n\\n“How is your mistress?”\\n\\n“A successful confinement yesterday.”\\n\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch stopped short and turned white. He felt\\ndistinctly now how intensely he had longed for her death.\\n\\n“And how is she?”\\n\\nKorney in his morning apron ran downstairs.\\n\\n“Very ill,” he answered. “There was a consultation yesterday, and the\\ndoctor’s here now.”\\n\\n“Take my things,” said Alexey Alexandrovitch, and feeling some relief\\nat the news that there was still hope of her death, he went into the\\nhall.\\n\\nOn the hatstand there was a military overcoat. Alexey Alexandrovitch\\nnoticed it and asked:\\n\\n“Who is here?”\\n\\n“The doctor, the midwife, and Count Vronsky.”\\n\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch went into the inner rooms.\\n\\nIn the drawing-room there was no one; at the sound of his steps there\\ncame out of her boudoir the midwife in a cap with lilac ribbons.\\n\\nShe went up to Alexey Alexandrovitch, and with the familiarity given by\\nthe approach of death took him by the arm and drew him towards the\\nbedroom.\\n\\n“Thank God you’ve come! She keeps on about you and nothing but you,”\\nshe said.\\n\\n“Make haste with the ice!” the doctor’s peremptory voice said from the\\nbedroom.\\n\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch went into her boudoir.\\n\\nAt the table, sitting sideways in a low chair, was Vronsky, his face\\nhidden in his hands, weeping. He jumped up at the doctor’s voice, took\\nhis hands from his face, and saw Alexey Alexandrovitch. Seeing the\\nhusband, he was so overwhelmed that he sat down again, drawing his head\\ndown to his shoulders, as if he wanted to disappear; but he made an\\neffort over himself, got up and said:\\n\\n“She is dying. The doctors say there is no hope. I am entirely in your\\npower, only let me be here ... though I am at your disposal. I....”\\n\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch, seeing Vronsky’s tears, felt a rush of that\\nnervous emotion always produced in him by the sight of other people’s\\nsuffering, and turning away his face, he moved hurriedly to the door,\\nwithout hearing the rest of his words. From the bedroom came the sound\\nof Anna’s voice saying something. Her voice was lively, eager, with\\nexceedingly distinct intonations. Alexey Alexandrovitch went into the\\nbedroom, and went up to the bed. She was lying turned with her face\\ntowards him. Her cheeks were flushed crimson, her eyes glittered, her\\nlittle white hands thrust out from the sleeves of her dressing gown\\nwere playing with the quilt, twisting it about. It seemed as though she\\nwere not only well and blooming, but in the happiest frame of mind. She\\nwas talking rapidly, musically, and with exceptionally correct\\narticulation and expressive intonation.\\n\\n“For Alexey—I am speaking of Alexey Alexandrovitch (what a strange and\\nawful thing that both are Alexey, isn’t it?)—Alexey would not refuse\\nme. I should forget, he would forgive.... But why doesn’t he come? He’s\\nso good he doesn’t know himself how good he is. Ah, my God, what agony!\\nGive me some water, quick! Oh, that will be bad for her, my little\\ngirl! Oh, very well then, give her to a nurse. Yes, I agree, it’s\\nbetter in fact. He’ll be coming; it will hurt him to see her. Give her\\nto the nurse.”\\n\\n“Anna Arkadyevna, he has come. Here he is!” said the midwife, trying to\\nattract her attention to Alexey Alexandrovitch.\\n\\n“Oh, what nonsense!” Anna went on, not seeing her husband. “No, give\\nher to me; give me my little one! He has not come yet. You say he won’t\\nforgive me, because you don’t know him. No one knows him. I’m the only\\none, and it was hard for me even. His eyes I ought to know—Seryozha has\\njust the same eyes—and I can’t bear to see them because of it. Has\\nSeryozha had his dinner? I know everyone will forget him. He would not\\nforget. Seryozha must be moved into the corner room, and Mariette must\\nbe asked to sleep with him.”\\n\\nAll of a sudden she shrank back, was silent; and in terror, as though\\nexpecting a blow, as though to defend herself, she raised her hands to\\nher face. She had seen her husband.\\n\\n“No, no!” she began. “I am not afraid of him; I am afraid of death.\\nAlexey, come here. I am in a hurry, because I’ve no time, I’ve not long\\nleft to live; the fever will begin directly and I shall understand\\nnothing more. Now I understand, I understand it all, I see it all!”\\n\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch’s wrinkled face wore an expression of agony; he\\ntook her by the hand and tried to say something, but he could not utter\\nit; his lower lip quivered, but he still went on struggling with his\\nemotion, and only now and then glanced at her. And each time he glanced\\nat her, he saw her eyes gazing at him with such passionate and\\ntriumphant tenderness as he had never seen in them.\\n\\n“Wait a minute, you don’t know ... stay a little, stay!...” She\\nstopped, as though collecting her ideas. “Yes,” she began; “yes, yes,\\nyes. This is what I wanted to say. Don’t be surprised at me. I’m still\\nthe same.... But there is another woman in me, I’m afraid of her: she\\nloved that man, and I tried to hate you, and could not forget about her\\nthat used to be. I’m not that woman. Now I’m my real self, all myself.\\nI’m dying now, I know I shall die, ask him. Even now I feel—see here,\\nthe weights on my feet, on my hands, on my fingers. My fingers—see how\\nhuge they are! But this will soon all be over.... Only one thing I\\nwant: forgive me, forgive me quite. I’m terrible, but my nurse used to\\ntell me; the holy martyr—what was her name? She was worse. And I’ll go\\nto Rome; there’s a wilderness, and there I shall be no trouble to\\nanyone, only I’ll take Seryozha and the little one.... No, you can’t\\nforgive me! I know, it can’t be forgiven! No, no, go away, you’re too\\ngood!” She held his hand in one burning hand, while she pushed him away\\nwith the other.\\n\\nThe nervous agitation of Alexey Alexandrovitch kept increasing, and had\\nby now reached such a point that he ceased to struggle with it. He\\nsuddenly felt that what he had regarded as nervous agitation was on the\\ncontrary a blissful spiritual condition that gave him all at once a new\\nhappiness he had never known. He did not think that the Christian law\\nthat he had been all his life trying to follow, enjoined on him to\\nforgive and love his enemies; but a glad feeling of love and\\nforgiveness for his enemies filled his heart. He knelt down, and laying\\nhis head in the curve of her arm, which burned him as with fire through\\nthe sleeve, he sobbed like a little child. She put her arm around his\\nhead, moved towards him, and with defiant pride lifted up her eyes.\\n\\n“That is he. I knew him! Now, forgive me, everyone, forgive me!...\\nThey’ve come again; why don’t they go away?... Oh, take these cloaks\\noff me!”\\n\\nThe doctor unloosed her hands, carefully laying her on the pillow, and\\ncovered her up to the shoulders. She lay back submissively, and looked\\nbefore her with beaming eyes.\\n\\n“Remember one thing, that I needed nothing but forgiveness, and I want\\nnothing more.... Why doesn’t _he_ come?” she said, turning to the door\\ntowards Vronsky. “Do come, do come! Give him your hand.”\\n\\nVronsky came to the side of the bed, and seeing Anna, again hid his\\nface in his hands.\\n\\n“Uncover your face—look at him! He’s a saint,” she said. “Oh! uncover\\nyour face, do uncover it!” she said angrily. “Alexey Alexandrovitch, do\\nuncover his face! I want to see him.”\\n\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch took Vronsky’s hands and drew them away from his\\nface, which was awful with the expression of agony and shame upon it.\\n\\n“Give him your hand. Forgive him.”\\n\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch gave him his hand, not attempting to restrain the\\ntears that streamed from his eyes.\\n\\n“Thank God, thank God!” she said, “now everything is ready. Only to\\nstretch my legs a little. There, that’s capital. How badly these\\nflowers are done—not a bit like a violet,” she said, pointing to the\\nhangings. “My God, my God! when will it end? Give me some morphine.\\nDoctor, give me some morphine! Oh, my God, my God!”\\n\\nAnd she tossed about on the bed.\\n\\nThe doctors said that it was puerperal fever, and that it was\\nninety-nine chances in a hundred it would end in death. The whole day\\nlong there was fever, delirium, and unconsciousness. At midnight the\\npatient lay without consciousness, and almost without pulse.\\n\\nThe end was expected every minute.\\n\\nVronsky had gone home, but in the morning he came to inquire, and\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch meeting him in the hall, said: “Better stay, she\\nmight ask for you,” and himself led him to his wife’s boudoir. Towards\\nmorning, there was a return again of excitement, rapid thought and\\ntalk, and again it ended in unconsciousness. On the third day it was\\nthe same thing, and the doctors said there was hope. That day Alexey\\nAlexandrovitch went into the boudoir where Vronsky was sitting, and\\nclosing the door sat down opposite him.\\n\\n“Alexey Alexandrovitch,” said Vronsky, feeling that a statement of the\\nposition was coming, “I can’t speak, I can’t understand. Spare me!\\nHowever hard it is for you, believe me, it is more terrible for me.”\\n\\nHe would have risen; but Alexey Alexandrovitch took him by the hand and\\nsaid:\\n\\n“I beg you to hear me out; it is necessary. I must explain my feelings,\\nthe feelings that have guided me and will guide me, so that you may not\\nbe in error regarding me. You know I had resolved on a divorce, and had\\neven begun to take proceedings. I won’t conceal from you that in\\nbeginning this I was in uncertainty, I was in misery; I will confess\\nthat I was pursued by a desire to revenge myself on you and on her.\\nWhen I got the telegram, I came here with the same feelings; I will say\\nmore, I longed for her death. But....” He paused, pondering whether to\\ndisclose or not to disclose his feeling to him. “But I saw her and\\nforgave her. And the happiness of forgiveness has revealed to me my\\nduty. I forgive completely. I would offer the other cheek, I would give\\nmy cloak if my coat be taken. I pray to God only not to take from me\\nthe bliss of forgiveness!”\\n\\nTears stood in his eyes, and the luminous, serene look in them\\nimpressed Vronsky.\\n\\n“This is my position: you can trample me in the mud, make me the\\nlaughing-stock of the world, I will not abandon her, and I will never\\nutter a word of reproach to you,” Alexey Alexandrovitch went on. “My\\nduty is clearly marked for me; I ought to be with her, and I will be.\\nIf she wishes to see you, I will let you know, but now I suppose it\\nwould be better for you to go away.”\\n\\nHe got up, and sobs cut short his words. Vronsky too was getting up,\\nand in a stooping, not yet erect posture, looked up at him from under\\nhis brows. He did not understand Alexey Alexandrovitch’s feeling, but\\nhe felt that it was something higher and even unattainable for him with\\nhis view of life 18\\n\\nAfter the conversation with Alexey Alexandrovitch, Vronsky went out\\nonto the steps of the Karenins’ house and stood still, with difficulty\\nremembering where he was, and where he ought to walk or drive. He felt\\ndisgraced, humiliated, guilty, and deprived of all possibility of\\nwashing away his humiliation. He felt thrust out of the beaten track\\nalong which he had so proudly and lightly walked till then. All the\\nhabits and rules of his life that had seemed so firm, had turned out\\nsuddenly false and inapplicable. The betrayed husband, who had figured\\ntill that time as a pitiful creature, an incidental and somewhat\\nludicrous obstacle to his happiness, had suddenly been summoned by her\\nherself, elevated to an awe-inspiring pinnacle, and on the pinnacle\\nthat husband had shown himself, not malignant, not false, not\\nludicrous, but kind and straightforward and large. Vronsky could not\\nbut feel this, and the parts were suddenly reversed. Vronsky felt his\\nelevation and his own abasement, his truth and his own falsehood. He\\nfelt that the husband was magnanimous even in his sorrow, while he had\\nbeen base and petty in his deceit. But this sense of his own\\nhumiliation before the man he had unjustly despised made up only a\\nsmall part of his misery. He felt unutterably wretched now, for his\\npassion for Anna, which had seemed to him of late to be growing cooler,\\nnow that he knew he had lost her forever, was stronger than ever it had\\nbeen. He had seen all of her in her illness, had come to know her very\\nsoul, and it seemed to him that he had never loved her till then. And\\nnow when he had learned to know her, to love her as she should be\\nloved, he had been humiliated before her, and had lost her forever,\\nleaving with her nothing of himself but a shameful memory. Most\\nterrible of all had been his ludicrous, shameful position when Alexey\\nAlexandrovitch had pulled his hands away from his humiliated face. He\\nstood on the steps of the Karenins’ house like one distraught, and did\\nnot know what to do.\\n\\n“A sledge, sir?” asked the porter.\\n\\n“Yes, a sledge.”\\n\\nOn getting home, after three sleepless nights, Vronsky, without\\nundressing, lay down flat on the sofa, clasping his hands and laying\\nhis head on them. His head was heavy. Images, memories, and ideas of\\nthe strangest description followed one another with extraordinary\\nrapidity and vividness. First it was the medicine he had poured out for\\nthe patient and spilt over the spoon, then the midwife’s white hands,\\nthen the queer posture of Alexey Alexandrovitch on the floor beside the\\nbed.\\n\\n“To sleep! To forget!” he said to himself with the serene confidence of\\na healthy man that if he is tired and sleepy, he will go to sleep at\\nonce. And the same instant his head did begin to feel drowsy and he\\nbegan to drop off into forgetfulness. The waves of the sea of\\nunconsciousness had begun to meet over his head, when all at once—it\\nwas as though a violent shock of electricity had passed over him. He\\nstarted so that he leaped up on the springs of the sofa, and leaning on\\nhis arms got in a panic onto his knees. His eyes were wide open as\\nthough he had never been asleep. The heaviness in his head and the\\nweariness in his limbs that he had felt a minute before had suddenly\\ngone.\\n\\n“You may trample me in the mud,” he heard Alexey Alexandrovitch’s words\\nand saw him standing before him, and saw Anna’s face with its burning\\nflush and glittering eyes, gazing with love and tenderness not at him\\nbut at Alexey Alexandrovitch; he saw his own, as he fancied, foolish\\nand ludicrous figure when Alexey Alexandrovitch took his hands away\\nfrom his face. He stretched out his legs again and flung himself on the\\nsofa in the same position and shut his eyes.\\n\\n“To sleep! To forget!” he repeated to himself. But with his eyes shut\\nhe saw more distinctly than ever Anna’s face as it had been on the\\nmemorable evening before the races.\\n\\n“That is not and will not be, and she wants to wipe it out of her\\nmemory. But I cannot live without it. How can we be reconciled? how can\\nwe be reconciled?” he said aloud, and unconsciously began to repeat\\nthese words. This repetition checked the rising up of fresh images and\\nmemories, which he felt were thronging in his brain. But repeating\\nwords did not check his imagination for long. Again in extraordinarily\\nrapid succession his best moments rose before his mind, and then his\\nrecent humiliation. “Take away his hands,” Anna’s voice says. He takes\\naway his hands and feels the shamestruck and idiotic expression of his\\nface.\\n\\nHe still lay down, trying to sleep, though he felt there was not the\\nsmallest hope of it, and kept repeating stray words from some chain of\\nthought, trying by this to check the rising flood of fresh images. He\\nlistened, and heard in a strange, mad whisper words repeated: “I did\\nnot appreciate it, did not make enough of it. I did not appreciate it,\\ndid not make enough of it.”\\n\\n“What’s this? Am I going out of my mind?” he said to himself. “Perhaps.\\nWhat makes men go out of their minds; what makes men shoot themselves?”\\nhe answered himself, and opening his eyes, he saw with wonder an\\nembroidered cushion beside him, worked by Varya, his brother’s wife. He\\ntouched the tassel of the cushion, and tried to think of Varya, of when\\nhe had seen her last. But to think of anything extraneous was an\\nagonizing effort. “No, I must sleep!” He moved the cushion up, and\\npressed his head into it, but he had to make an effort to keep his eyes\\nshut. He jumped up and sat down. “That’s all over for me,” he said to\\nhimself. “I must think what to do. What is left?” His mind rapidly ran\\nthrough his life apart from his love of Anna.\\n\\n“Ambition? Serpuhovskoy? Society? The court?” He could not come to a\\npause anywhere. All of it had had meaning before, but now there was no\\nreality in it. He got up from the sofa, took off his coat, undid his\\nbelt, and uncovering his hairy chest to breathe more freely, walked up\\nand down the room. “This is how people go mad,” he repeated, “and how\\nthey shoot themselves ... to escape humiliation,” he added slowly.\\n\\nHe went to the door and closed it, then with fixed eyes and clenched\\nteeth he went up to the table, took a revolver, looked round him,\\nturned it to a loaded barrel, and sank into thought. For two minutes,\\nhis head bent forward with an expression of an intense effort of\\nthought, he stood with the revolver in his hand, motionless, thinking.\\n\\n“Of course,” he said to himself, as though a logical, continuous, and\\nclear chain of reasoning had brought him to an indubitable conclusion.\\nIn reality this “of course,” that seemed convincing to him, was simply\\nthe result of exactly the same circle of memories and images through\\nwhich he had passed ten times already during the last hour—memories of\\nhappiness lost forever. There was the same conception of the\\nsenselessness of everything to come in life, the same consciousness of\\nhumiliation. Even the sequence of these images and emotions was the\\nsame.\\n\\n“Of course,” he repeated, when for the third time his thought passed\\nagain round the same spellbound circle of memories and images, and\\npulling the revolver to the left side of his chest, and clutching it\\nvigorously with his whole hand, as it were, squeezing it in his fist,\\nhe pulled the trigger. He did not hear the sound of the shot, but a\\nviolent blow on his chest sent him reeling. He tried to clutch at the\\nedge of the table, dropped the revolver, staggered, and sat down on the\\nground, looking about him in astonishment. He did not recognize his\\nroom, looking up from the ground, at the bent legs of the table, at the\\nwastepaper basket, and the tiger-skin rug. The hurried, creaking steps\\nof his servant coming through the drawing-room brought him to his\\nsenses. He made an effort at thought, and was aware that he was on the\\nfloor; and seeing blood on the tiger-skin rug and on his arm, he knew\\nhe had shot himself.\\n\\n“Idiotic! Missed!” he said, fumbling after the revolver. The revolver\\nwas close beside him—he sought further off. Still feeling for it, he\\nstretched out to the other side, and not being strong enough to keep\\nhis balance, fell over, streaming with blood.\\n\\nThe elegant, whiskered manservant, who used to be continually\\ncomplaining to his acquaintances of the delicacy of his nerves, was so\\npanic-stricken on seeing his master lying on the floor, that he left\\nhim losing blood while he ran for assistance. An hour later Varya, his\\nbrother’s wife, had arrived, and with the assistance of three doctors,\\nwhom she had sent for in all directions, and who all appeared at the\\nsame moment, she got the wounded man to bed, and remained to nurse him 19\\n\\nThe mistake made by Alexey Alexandrovitch in that, when preparing for\\nseeing his wife, he had overlooked the possibility that her repentance\\nmight be sincere, and he might forgive her, and she might not die—this\\nmistake was two months after his return from Moscow brought home to him\\nin all its significance. But the mistake made by him had arisen not\\nsimply from his having overlooked that contingency, but also from the\\nfact that until that day of his interview with his dying wife, he had\\nnot known his own heart. At his sick wife’s bedside he had for the\\nfirst time in his life given way to that feeling of sympathetic\\nsuffering always roused in him by the sufferings of others, and\\nhitherto looked on by him with shame as a harmful weakness. And pity\\nfor her, and remorse for having desired her death, and most of all, the\\njoy of forgiveness, made him at once conscious, not simply of the\\nrelief of his own sufferings, but of a spiritual peace he had never\\nexperienced before. He suddenly felt that the very thing that was the\\nsource of his sufferings had become the source of his spiritual joy;\\nthat what had seemed insoluble while he was judging, blaming, and\\nhating, had become clear and simple when he forgave and loved.\\n\\nHe forgave his wife and pitied her for her sufferings and her remorse.\\nHe forgave Vronsky, and pitied him, especially after reports reached\\nhim of his despairing action. He felt more for his son than before. And\\nhe blamed himself now for having taken too little interest in him. But\\nfor the little newborn baby he felt a quite peculiar sentiment, not of\\npity, only, but of tenderness. At first, from a feeling of compassion\\nalone, he had been interested in the delicate little creature, who was\\nnot his child, and who was cast on one side during her mother’s\\nillness, and would certainly have died if he had not troubled about\\nher, and he did not himself observe how fond he became of her. He would\\ngo into the nursery several times a day, and sit there for a long\\nwhile, so that the nurses, who were at first afraid of him, got quite\\nused to his presence. Sometimes for half an hour at a stretch he would\\nsit silently gazing at the saffron-red, downy, wrinkled face of the\\nsleeping baby, watching the movements of the frowning brows, and the\\nfat little hands, with clenched fingers, that rubbed the little eyes\\nand nose. At such moments particularly, Alexey Alexandrovitch had a\\nsense of perfect peace and inward harmony, and saw nothing\\nextraordinary in his position, nothing that ought to be changed.\\n\\nBut as time went on, he saw more and more distinctly that however\\nnatural the position now seemed to him, he would not long be allowed to\\nremain in it. He felt that besides the blessed spiritual force\\ncontrolling his soul, there was another, a brutal force, as powerful,\\nor more powerful, which controlled his life, and that this force would\\nnot allow him that humble peace he longed for. He felt that everyone\\nwas looking at him with inquiring wonder, that he was not understood,\\nand that something was expected of him. Above all, he felt the\\ninstability and unnaturalness of his relations with his wife.\\n\\nWhen the softening effect of the near approach of death had passed\\naway, Alexey Alexandrovitch began to notice that Anna was afraid of\\nhim, ill at ease with him, and could not look him straight in the face.\\nShe seemed to be wanting, and not daring, to tell him something; and as\\nthough foreseeing their present relations could not continue, she\\nseemed to be expecting something from him.\\n\\nTowards the end of February it happened that Anna’s baby daughter, who\\nhad been named Anna too, fell ill. Alexey Alexandrovitch was in the\\nnursery in the morning, and leaving orders for the doctor to be sent\\nfor, he went to his office. On finishing his work, he returned home at\\nfour. Going into the hall he saw a handsome groom, in a braided livery\\nand a bear fur cape, holding a white fur cloak.\\n\\n“Who is here?” asked Alexey Alexandrovitch.\\n\\n“Princess Elizaveta Federovna Tverskaya,” the groom answered, and it\\nseemed to Alexey Alexandrovitch that he grinned.\\n\\nDuring all this difficult time Alexey Alexandrovitch had noticed that\\nhis worldly acquaintances, especially women, took a peculiar interest\\nin him and his wife. All these acquaintances he observed with\\ndifficulty concealing their mirth at something; the same mirth that he\\nhad perceived in the lawyer’s eyes, and just now in the eyes of this\\ngroom. Everyone seemed, somehow, hugely delighted, as though they had\\njust been at a wedding. When they met him, with ill-disguised enjoyment\\nthey inquired after his wife’s health. The presence of Princess\\nTverskaya was unpleasant to Alexey Alexandrovitch from the memories\\nassociated with her, and also because he disliked her, and he went\\nstraight to the nursery. In the day nursery Seryozha, leaning on the\\ntable with his legs on a chair, was drawing and chatting away merrily.\\nThe English governess, who had during Anna’s illness replaced the\\nFrench one, was sitting near the boy knitting a shawl. She hurriedly\\ngot up, curtseyed, and pulled Seryozha.\\n\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch stroked his son’s hair, answered the governess’s\\ninquiries about his wife, and asked what the doctor had said of the\\nbaby.\\n\\n“The doctor said it was nothing serious, and he ordered a bath, sir.”\\n\\n“But she is still in pain,” said Alexey Alexandrovitch, listening to\\nthe baby’s screaming in the next room.\\n\\n“I think it’s the wet-nurse, sir,” the Englishwoman said firmly.\\n\\n“What makes you think so?” he asked, stopping short.\\n\\n“It’s just as it was at Countess Paul’s, sir. They gave the baby\\nmedicine, and it turned out that the baby was simply hungry: the nurse\\nhad no milk, sir.”\\n\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch pondered, and after standing still a few seconds\\nhe went in at the other door. The baby was lying with its head thrown\\nback, stiffening itself in the nurse’s arms, and would not take the\\nplump breast offered it; and it never ceased screaming in spite of the\\ndouble hushing of the wet-nurse and the other nurse, who was bending\\nover her.\\n\\n“Still no better?” said Alexey Alexandrovitch.\\n\\n“She’s very restless,” answered the nurse in a whisper.\\n\\n“Miss Edwarde says that perhaps the wet-nurse has no milk,” he said.\\n\\n“I think so too, Alexey Alexandrovitch.”\\n\\n“Then why didn’t you say so?”\\n\\n“Who’s one to say it to? Anna Arkadyevna still ill....” said the nurse\\ndiscontentedly.\\n\\nThe nurse was an old servant of the family. And in her simple words\\nthere seemed to Alexey Alexandrovitch an allusion to his position.\\n\\nThe baby screamed louder than ever, struggling and sobbing. The nurse,\\nwith a gesture of despair, went to it, took it from the wet-nurse’s\\narms, and began walking up and down, rocking it.\\n\\n“You must ask the doctor to examine the wet-nurse,” said Alexey\\nAlexandrovitch. The smartly dressed and healthy-looking nurse,\\nfrightened at the idea of losing her place, muttered something to\\nherself, and covering her bosom, smiled contemptuously at the idea of\\ndoubts being cast on her abundance of milk. In that smile, too, Alexey\\nAlexandrovitch saw a sneer at his position.\\n\\n“Luckless child!” said the nurse, hushing the baby, and still walking\\nup and down with it.\\n\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch sat down, and with a despondent and suffering\\nface watched the nurse walking to and fro.\\n\\nWhen the child at last was still, and had been put in a deep bed, and\\nthe nurse, after smoothing the little pillow, had left her, Alexey\\nAlexandrovitch got up, and walking awkwardly on tiptoe, approached the\\nbaby. For a minute he was still, and with the same despondent face\\ngazed at the baby; but all at once a smile, that moved his hair and the\\nskin of his forehead, came out on his face, and he went as softly out\\nof the room.\\n\\nIn the dining-room he rang the bell, and told the servant who came in\\nto send again for the doctor. He felt vexed with his wife for not being\\nanxious about this exquisite baby, and in this vexed humor he had no\\nwish to go to her; he had no wish, either, to see Princess Betsy. But\\nhis wife might wonder why he did not go to her as usual; and so,\\novercoming his disinclination, he went towards the bedroom. As he\\nwalked over the soft rug towards the door, he could not help\\noverhearing a conversation he did not want to hear.\\n\\n“If he hadn’t been going away, I could have understood your answer and\\nhis too. But your husband ought to be above that,” Betsy was saying.\\n\\n“It’s not for my husband; for myself I don’t wish it. Don’t say that!”\\nanswered Anna’s excited voice.\\n\\n“Yes, but you must care to say good-bye to a man who has shot himself\\non your account....”\\n\\n“That’s just why I don’t want to.”\\n\\nWith a dismayed and guilty expression, Alexey Alexandrovitch stopped\\nand would have gone back unobserved. But reflecting that this would be\\nundignified, he turned back again, and clearing his throat, he went up\\nto the bedroom. The voices were silent, and he went in.\\n\\nAnna, in a gray dressing gown, with a crop of short clustering black\\ncurls on her round head, was sitting on a settee. The eagerness died\\nout of her face, as it always did, at the sight of her husband; she\\ndropped her head and looked round uneasily at Betsy. Betsy, dressed in\\nthe height of the latest fashion, in a hat that towered somewhere over\\nher head like a shade on a lamp, in a blue dress with violet crossway\\nstripes slanting one way on the bodice and the other way on the skirt,\\nwas sitting beside Anna, her tall flat figure held erect. Bowing her\\nhead, she greeted Alexey Alexandrovitch with an ironical smile.\\n\\n“Ah!” she said, as though surprised. “I’m very glad you’re at home. You\\nnever put in an appearance anywhere, and I haven’t seen you ever since\\nAnna has been ill. I have heard all about it—your anxiety. Yes, you’re\\na wonderful husband!” she said, with a meaning and affable air, as\\nthough she were bestowing an order of magnanimity on him for his\\nconduct to his wife.\\n\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch bowed frigidly, and kissing his wife’s hand,\\nasked how she was.\\n\\n“Better, I think,” she said, avoiding his eyes.\\n\\n“But you’ve rather a feverish-looking color,” he said, laying stress on\\nthe word “feverish.”\\n\\n“We’ve been talking too much,” said Betsy. “I feel it’s selfishness on\\nmy part, and I am going away.”\\n\\nShe got up, but Anna, suddenly flushing, quickly caught at her hand.\\n\\n“No, wait a minute, please. I must tell you ... no, you.” she turned to\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch, and her neck and brow were suffused with\\ncrimson. “I won’t and can’t keep anything secret from you,” she said.\\n\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch cracked his fingers and bowed his head.\\n\\n“Betsy’s been telling me that Count Vronsky wants to come here to say\\ngood-bye before his departure for Tashkend.” She did not look at her\\nhusband, and was evidently in haste to have everything out, however\\nhard it might be for her. “I told her I could not receive him.”\\n\\n“You said, my dear, that it would depend on Alexey Alexandrovitch,”\\nBetsy corrected her.\\n\\n“Oh, no, I can’t receive him; and what object would there....” She\\nstopped suddenly, and glanced inquiringly at her husband (he did not\\nlook at her). “In short, I don’t wish it....”\\n\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch advanced and would have taken her hand.\\n\\nHer first impulse was to jerk back her hand from the damp hand with big\\nswollen veins that sought hers, but with an obvious effort to control\\nherself she pressed his hand.\\n\\n“I am very grateful to you for your confidence, but....” he said,\\nfeeling with confusion and annoyance that what he could decide easily\\nand clearly by himself, he could not discuss before Princess Tverskaya,\\nwho to him stood for the incarnation of that brute force which would\\ninevitably control him in the life he led in the eyes of the world, and\\nhinder him from giving way to his feeling of love and forgiveness. He\\nstopped short, looking at Princess Tverskaya.\\n\\n“Well, good-bye, my darling,” said Betsy, getting up. She kissed Anna,\\nand went out. Alexey Alexandrovitch escorted her out.\\n\\n“Alexey Alexandrovitch! I know you are a truly magnanimous man,” said\\nBetsy, stopping in the little drawing-room, and with special warmth\\nshaking hands with him once more. “I am an outsider, but I so love her\\nand respect you that I venture to advise. Receive him. Alexey Vronsky\\nis the soul of honor, and he is going away to Tashkend.”\\n\\n“Thank you, princess, for your sympathy and advice. But the question of\\nwhether my wife can or cannot see anyone she must decide herself.”\\n\\nHe said this from habit, lifting his brows with dignity, and reflected\\nimmediately that whatever his words might be, there could be no dignity\\nin his position. And he saw this by the suppressed, malicious, and\\nironical smile with which Betsy glanced at him after this phrase 20\\n\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch took leave of Betsy in the drawing-room, and went\\nto his wife. She was lying down, but hearing his steps she sat up\\nhastily in her former attitude, and looked in a scared way at him. He\\nsaw she had been crying.\\n\\n“I am very grateful for your confidence in me.” He repeated gently in\\nRussian the phrase he had said in Betsy’s presence in French, and sat\\ndown beside her. When he spoke to her in Russian, using the Russian\\n“thou” of intimacy and affection, it was insufferably irritating to\\nAnna. “And I am very grateful for your decision. I, too, imagine that\\nsince he is going away, there is no sort of necessity for Count Vronsky\\nto come here. However, if....”\\n\\n“But I’ve said so already, so why repeat it?” Anna suddenly interrupted\\nhim with an irritation she could not succeed in repressing. “No sort of\\nnecessity,” she thought, “for a man to come and say good-bye to the\\nwoman he loves, for whom he was ready to ruin himself, and has ruined\\nhimself, and who cannot live without him. No sort of necessity!” she\\ncompressed her lips, and dropped her burning eyes to his hands with\\ntheir swollen veins. They were rubbing each other.\\n\\n“Let us never speak of it,” she added more calmly.\\n\\n“I have left this question to you to decide, and I am very glad to\\nsee....” Alexey Alexandrovitch was beginning.\\n\\n“That my wish coincides with your own,” she finished quickly,\\nexasperated at his talking so slowly while she knew beforehand all he\\nwould say.\\n\\n“Yes,” he assented; “and Princess Tverskaya’s interference in the most\\ndifficult private affairs is utterly uncalled for. She especially....”\\n\\n“I don’t believe a word of what’s said about her,” said Anna quickly.\\n“I know she really cares for me.”\\n\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch sighed and said nothing. She played nervously\\nwith the tassel of her dressing-gown, glancing at him with that\\ntorturing sensation of physical repulsion for which she blamed herself,\\nthough she could not control it. Her only desire now was to be rid of\\nhis oppressive presence.\\n\\n“I have just sent for the doctor,” said Alexey Alexandrovitch.\\n\\n“I am very well; what do I want the doctor for?”\\n\\n“No, the little one cries, and they say the nurse hasn’t enough milk.”\\n\\n“Why didn’t you let me nurse her, when I begged to? Anyway” (Alexey\\nAlexandrovitch knew what was meant by that “anyway”), “she’s a baby,\\nand they’re killing her.” She rang the bell and ordered the baby to be\\nbrought her. “I begged to nurse her, I wasn’t allowed to, and now I’m\\nblamed for it.”\\n\\n“I don’t blame....”\\n\\n“Yes, you do blame me! My God! why didn’t I die!” And she broke into\\nsobs. “Forgive me, I’m nervous, I’m unjust,” she said, controlling\\nherself, “but do go away....”\\n\\n“No, it can’t go on like this,” Alexey Alexandrovitch said to himself\\ndecidedly as he left his wife’s room.\\n\\nNever had the impossibility of his position in the world’s eyes, and\\nhis wife’s hatred of him, and altogether the might of that mysterious\\nbrutal force that guided his life against his spiritual inclinations,\\nand exacted conformity with its decrees and change in his attitude to\\nhis wife, been presented to him with such distinctness as that day. He\\nsaw clearly that all the world and his wife expected of him something,\\nbut what exactly, he could not make out. He felt that this was rousing\\nin his soul a feeling of anger destructive of his peace of mind and of\\nall the good of his achievement. He believed that for Anna herself it\\nwould be better to break off all relations with Vronsky; but if they\\nall thought this out of the question, he was even ready to allow these\\nrelations to be renewed, so long as the children were not disgraced,\\nand he was not deprived of them nor forced to change his position. Bad\\nas this might be, it was anyway better than a rupture, which would put\\nher in a hopeless and shameful position, and deprive him of everything\\nhe cared for. But he felt helpless; he knew beforehand that everyone\\nwas against him, and that he would not be allowed to do what seemed to\\nhim now so natural and right, but would be forced to do what was wrong,\\nthough it seemed the proper thing to them 21\\n\\nBefore Betsy had time to walk out of the drawing-room, she was met in\\nthe doorway by Stepan Arkadyevitch, who had just come from Yeliseev’s,\\nwhere a consignment of fresh oysters had been received.\\n\\n“Ah! princess! what a delightful meeting!” he began. “I’ve been to see\\nyou.”\\n\\n“A meeting for one minute, for I’m going,” said Betsy, smiling and\\nputting on her glove.\\n\\n“Don’t put on your glove yet, princess; let me kiss your hand. There’s\\nnothing I’m so thankful to the revival of the old fashions for as the\\nkissing the hand.” He kissed Betsy’s hand. “When shall we see each\\nother?”\\n\\n“You don’t deserve it,” answered Betsy, smiling.\\n\\n“Oh, yes, I deserve a great deal, for I’ve become a most serious\\nperson. I don’t only manage my own affairs, but other people’s too,” he\\nsaid, with a significant expression.\\n\\n“Oh, I’m so glad!” answered Betsy, at once understanding that he was\\nspeaking of Anna. And going back into the drawing-room, they stood in a\\ncorner. “He’s killing her,” said Betsy in a whisper full of meaning.\\n“It’s impossible, impossible....”\\n\\n“I’m so glad you think so,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, shaking his head\\nwith a serious and sympathetically distressed expression, “that’s what\\nI’ve come to Petersburg for.”\\n\\n“The whole town’s talking of it,” she said. “It’s an impossible\\nposition. She pines and pines away. He doesn’t understand that she’s\\none of those women who can’t trifle with their feelings. One of two\\nthings: either let him take her away, act with energy, or give her a\\ndivorce. This is stifling her.”\\n\\n“Yes, yes ... just so....” Oblonsky said, sighing. “That’s what I’ve\\ncome for. At least not solely for that ... I’ve been made a\\n_Kammerherr_; of course, one has to say thank you. But the chief thing\\nwas having to settle this.”\\n\\n“Well, God help you!” said Betsy.\\n\\nAfter accompanying Betsy to the outside hall, once more kissing her\\nhand above the glove, at the point where the pulse beats, and murmuring\\nto her such unseemly nonsense that she did not know whether to laugh or\\nbe angry, Stepan Arkadyevitch went to his sister. He found her in\\ntears.\\n\\nAlthough he happened to be bubbling over with good spirits, Stepan\\nArkadyevitch immediately and quite naturally fell into the sympathetic,\\npoetically emotional tone which harmonized with her mood. He asked her\\nhow she was, and how she had spent the morning.\\n\\n“Very, very miserably. Today and this morning and all past days and\\ndays to come,” she said.\\n\\n“I think you’re giving way to pessimism. You must rouse yourself, you\\nmust look life in the face. I know it’s hard, but....”\\n\\n“I have heard it said that women love men even for their vices,” Anna\\nbegan suddenly, “but I hate him for his virtues. I can’t live with him.\\nDo you understand? the sight of him has a physical effect on me, it\\nmakes me beside myself. I can’t, I can’t live with him. What am I to\\ndo? I have been unhappy, and used to think one couldn’t be more\\nunhappy, but the awful state of things I am going through now, I could\\nnever have conceived. Would you believe it, that knowing he’s a good\\nman, a splendid man, that I’m not worth his little finger, still I hate\\nhim. I hate him for his generosity. And there’s nothing left for me\\nbut....”\\n\\nShe would have said death, but Stepan Arkadyevitch would not let her\\nfinish.\\n\\n“You are ill and overwrought,” he said; “believe me, you’re\\nexaggerating dreadfully. There’s nothing so terrible in it.”\\n\\nAnd Stepan Arkadyevitch smiled. No one else in Stepan Arkadyevitch’s\\nplace, having to do with such despair, would have ventured to smile\\n(the smile would have seemed brutal); but in his smile there was so\\nmuch of sweetness and almost feminine tenderness that his smile did not\\nwound, but softened and soothed. His gentle, soothing words and smiles\\nwere as soothing and softening as almond oil. And Anna soon felt this.\\n\\n“No, Stiva,” she said, “I’m lost, lost! worse than lost! I can’t say\\nyet that all is over; on the contrary, I feel that it’s not over. I’m\\nan overstrained string that must snap. But it’s not ended yet ... and\\nit will have a fearful end.”\\n\\n“No matter, we must let the string be loosened, little by little.\\nThere’s no position from which there is no way of escape.”\\n\\n“I have thought, and thought. Only one....”\\n\\nAgain he knew from her terrified eyes that this one way of escape in\\nher thought was death, and he would not let her say it.\\n\\n“Not at all,” he said. “Listen to me. You can’t see your own position\\nas I can. Let me tell you candidly my opinion.” Again he smiled\\ndiscreetly his almond-oil smile. “I’ll begin from the beginning. You\\nmarried a man twenty years older than yourself. You married him without\\nlove and not knowing what love was. It was a mistake, let’s admit.”\\n\\n“A fearful mistake!” said Anna.\\n\\n“But I repeat, it’s an accomplished fact. Then you had, let us say, the\\nmisfortune to love a man not your husband. That was a misfortune; but\\nthat, too, is an accomplished fact. And your husband knew it and\\nforgave it.” He stopped at each sentence, waiting for her to object,\\nbut she made no answer. “That’s so. Now the question is: can you go on\\nliving with your husband? Do you wish it? Does he wish it?”\\n\\n“I know nothing, nothing.”\\n\\n“But you said yourself that you can’t endure him.”\\n\\n“No, I didn’t say so. I deny it. I can’t tell, I don’t know anything\\nabout it.”\\n\\n“Yes, but let....”\\n\\n“You can’t understand. I feel I’m lying head downwards in a sort of\\npit, but I ought not to save myself. And I can’t....”\\n\\n“Never mind, we’ll slip something under and pull you out. I understand\\nyou: I understand that you can’t take it on yourself to express your\\nwishes, your feelings.”\\n\\n“There’s nothing, nothing I wish ... except for it to be all over.”\\n\\n“But he sees this and knows it. And do you suppose it weighs on him any\\nless than on you? You’re wretched, he’s wretched, and what good can\\ncome of it? while divorce would solve the difficulty completely.” With\\nsome effort Stepan Arkadyevitch brought out his central idea, and\\nlooked significantly at her.\\n\\nShe said nothing, and shook her cropped head in dissent. But from the\\nlook in her face, that suddenly brightened into its old beauty, he saw\\nthat if she did not desire this, it was simply because it seemed to her\\nunattainable happiness.\\n\\n“I’m awfully sorry for you! And how happy I should be if I could\\narrange things!” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, smiling more boldly. “Don’t\\nspeak, don’t say a word! God grant only that I may speak as I feel. I’m\\ngoing to him.”\\n\\nAnna looked at him with dreamy, shining eyes, and said nothing 22\\n\\nStepan Arkadyevitch, with the same somewhat solemn expression with\\nwhich he used to take his presidential chair at his board, walked into\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch’s room. Alexey Alexandrovitch was walking about\\nhis room with his hands behind his back, thinking of just what Stepan\\nArkadyevitch had been discussing with his wife.\\n\\n“I’m not interrupting you?” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, on the sight of\\nhis brother-in-law becoming suddenly aware of a sense of embarrassment\\nunusual with him. To conceal this embarrassment he took out a cigarette\\ncase he had just bought that opened in a new way, and sniffing the\\nleather, took a cigarette out of it.\\n\\n“No. Do you want anything?” Alexey Alexandrovitch asked without\\neagerness.\\n\\n“Yes, I wished ... I wanted ... yes, I wanted to talk to you,” said\\nStepan Arkadyevitch, with surprise aware of an unaccustomed timidity.\\n\\nThis feeling was so unexpected and so strange that he did not believe\\nit was the voice of conscience telling him that what he was meaning to\\ndo was wrong.\\n\\nStepan Arkadyevitch made an effort and struggled with the timidity that\\nhad come over him.\\n\\n“I hope you believe in my love for my sister and my sincere affection\\nand respect for you,” he said, reddening.\\n\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch stood still and said nothing, but his face struck\\nStepan Arkadyevitch by its expression of an unresisting sacrifice.\\n\\n“I intended ... I wanted to have a little talk with you about my sister\\nand your mutual position,” he said, still struggling with an\\nunaccustomed constraint.\\n\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch smiled mournfully, looked at his brother-in-law,\\nand without answering went up to the table, took from it an unfinished\\nletter, and handed it to his brother-in-law.\\n\\n“I think unceasingly of the same thing. And here is what I had begun\\nwriting, thinking I could say it better by letter, and that my presence\\nirritates her,” he said, as he gave him the letter.\\n\\nStepan Arkadyevitch took the letter, looked with incredulous surprise\\nat the lusterless eyes fixed so immovably on him, and began to read.\\n\\n“I see that my presence is irksome to you. Painful as it is to me to\\nbelieve it, I see that it is so, and cannot be otherwise. I don’t blame\\nyou, and God is my witness that on seeing you at the time of your\\nillness I resolved with my whole heart to forget all that had passed\\nbetween us and to begin a new life. I do not regret, and shall never\\nregret, what I have done; but I have desired one thing—your good, the\\ngood of your soul—and now I see I have not attained that. Tell me\\nyourself what will give you true happiness and peace to your soul. I\\nput myself entirely in your hands, and trust to your feeling of what’s\\nright.”\\n\\nStepan Arkadyevitch handed back the letter, and with the same surprise\\ncontinued looking at his brother-in-law, not knowing what to say. This\\nsilence was so awkward for both of them that Stepan Arkadyevitch’s lips\\nbegan twitching nervously, while he still gazed without speaking at\\nKarenin’s face.\\n\\n“That’s what I wanted to say to her,” said Alexey Alexandrovitch,\\nturning away.\\n\\n“Yes, yes....” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, not able to answer for the\\ntears that were choking him.\\n\\n“Yes, yes, I understand you,” he brought out at last.\\n\\n“I want to know what she would like,” said Alexey Alexandrovitch.\\n\\n“I am afraid she does not understand her own position. She is not a\\njudge,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, recovering himself. “She is crushed,\\nsimply crushed by your generosity. If she were to read this letter, she\\nwould be incapable of saying anything, she would only hang her head\\nlower than ever.”\\n\\n“Yes, but what’s to be done in that case? how explain, how find out her\\nwishes?”\\n\\n“If you will allow me to give my opinion, I think that it lies with you\\nto point out directly the steps you consider necessary to end the\\nposition.”\\n\\n“So you consider it must be ended?” Alexey Alexandrovitch interrupted\\nhim. “But how?” he added, with a gesture of his hands before his eyes\\nnot usual with him. “I see no possible way out of it.”\\n\\n“There is some way of getting out of every position,” said Stepan\\nArkadyevitch, standing up and becoming more cheerful. “There was a time\\nwhen you thought of breaking off.... If you are convinced now that you\\ncannot make each other happy....”\\n\\n“Happiness may be variously understood. But suppose that I agree to\\neverything, that I want nothing: what way is there of getting out of\\nour position?”\\n\\n“If you care to know my opinion,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch with the\\nsame smile of softening, almond-oil tenderness with which he had been\\ntalking to Anna. His kindly smile was so winning that Alexey\\nAlexandrovitch, feeling his own weakness and unconsciously swayed by\\nit, was ready to believe what Stepan Arkadyevitch was saying.\\n\\n“She will never speak out about it. But one thing is possible, one\\nthing she might desire,” he went on, “that is the cessation of your\\nrelations and all memories associated with them. To my thinking, in\\nyour position what’s essential is the formation of a new attitude to\\none another. And that can only rest on a basis of freedom on both\\nsides.”\\n\\n“Divorce,” Alexey Alexandrovitch interrupted, in a tone of aversion.\\n\\n“Yes, I imagine that divorce—yes, divorce,” Stepan Arkadyevitch\\nrepeated, reddening. “That is from every point of view the most\\nrational course for married people who find themselves in the position\\nyou are in. What can be done if married people find that life is\\nimpossible for them together? That may always happen.”\\n\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch sighed heavily and closed his eyes.\\n\\n“There’s only one point to be considered: is either of the parties\\ndesirous of forming new ties? If not, it is very simple,” said Stepan\\nArkadyevitch, feeling more and more free from constraint.\\n\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch, scowling with emotion, muttered something to\\nhimself, and made no answer. All that seemed so simple to Stepan\\nArkadyevitch, Alexey Alexandrovitch had thought over thousands of\\ntimes. And, so far from being simple, it all seemed to him utterly\\nimpossible. Divorce, the details of which he knew by this time, seemed\\nto him now out of the question, because the sense of his own dignity\\nand respect for religion forbade his taking upon himself a fictitious\\ncharge of adultery, and still more suffering his wife, pardoned and\\nbeloved by him, to be caught in the fact and put to public shame.\\nDivorce appeared to him impossible also on other still more weighty\\ngrounds.\\n\\nWhat would become of his son in case of a divorce? To leave him with\\nhis mother was out of the question. The divorced mother would have her\\nown illegitimate family, in which his position as a stepson and his\\neducation would not be good. Keep him with him? He knew that would be\\nan act of vengeance on his part, and that he did not want. But apart\\nfrom this, what more than all made divorce seem impossible to Alexey\\nAlexandrovitch was, that by consenting to a divorce he would be\\ncompletely ruining Anna. The saying of Darya Alexandrovna at Moscow,\\nthat in deciding on a divorce he was thinking of himself, and not\\nconsidering that by this he would be ruining her irrevocably, had sunk\\ninto his heart. And connecting this saying with his forgiveness of her,\\nwith his devotion to the children, he understood it now in his own way.\\nTo consent to a divorce, to give her her freedom, meant in his thoughts\\nto take from himself the last tie that bound him to life—the children\\nwhom he loved; and to take from her the last prop that stayed her on\\nthe path of right, to thrust her down to her ruin. If she were\\ndivorced, he knew she would join her life to Vronsky’s, and their tie\\nwould be an illegitimate and criminal one, since a wife, by the\\ninterpretation of the ecclesiastical law, could not marry while her\\nhusband was living. “She will join him, and in a year or two he will\\nthrow her over, or she will form a new tie,” thought Alexey\\nAlexandrovitch. “And I, by agreeing to an unlawful divorce, shall be to\\nblame for her ruin.” He had thought it all over hundreds of times, and\\nwas convinced that a divorce was not at all simple, as Stepan\\nArkadyevitch had said, but was utterly impossible. He did not believe a\\nsingle word Stepan Arkadyevitch said to him; to every word he had a\\nthousand objections to make, but he listened to him, feeling that his\\nwords were the expression of that mighty brutal force which controlled\\nhis life and to which he would have to submit.\\n\\n“The only question is on what terms you agree to give her a divorce.\\nShe does not want anything, does not dare ask you for anything, she\\nleaves it all to your generosity.”\\n\\n“My God, my God! what for?” thought Alexey Alexandrovitch, remembering\\nthe details of divorce proceedings in which the husband took the blame\\non himself, and with just the same gesture with which Vronsky had done\\nthe same, he hid his face for shame in his hands.\\n\\n“You are distressed, I understand that. But if you think it over....”\\n\\n“Whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other\\nalso; and if any man take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak also,”\\nthought Alexey Alexandrovitch.\\n\\n“Yes, yes!” he cried in a shrill voice. “I will take the disgrace on\\nmyself, I will give up even my son, but ... but wouldn’t it be better\\nto let it alone? Still you may do as you like....”\\n\\nAnd turning away so that his brother-in-law could not see him, he sat\\ndown on a chair at the window. There was bitterness, there was shame in\\nhis heart, but with bitterness and shame he felt joy and emotion at the\\nheight of his own meekness.\\n\\nStepan Arkadyevitch was touched. He was silent for a space.\\n\\n“Alexey Alexandrovitch, believe me, she appreciates your generosity,”\\nhe said. “But it seems it was the will of God,” he added, and as he\\nsaid it felt how foolish a remark it was, and with difficulty repressed\\na smile at his own foolishness.\\n\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch would have made some reply, but tears stopped\\nhim.\\n\\n“This is an unhappy fatality, and one must accept it as such. I accept\\nthe calamity as an accomplished fact, and am doing my best to help both\\nher and you,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch.\\n\\nWhen he went out of his brother-in-law’s room he was touched, but that\\ndid not prevent him from being glad he had successfully brought the\\nmatter to a conclusion, for he felt certain Alexey Alexandrovitch would\\nnot go back on his words. To this satisfaction was added the fact that\\nan idea had just struck him for a riddle turning on his successful\\nachievement, that when the affair was over he would ask his wife and\\nmost intimate friends. He put this riddle into two or three different\\nways. “But I’ll work it out better than that,” he said to himself with\\na smile 23\\n\\nVronsky’s wound had been a dangerous one, though it did not touch the\\nheart, and for several days he had lain between life and death. The\\nfirst time he was able to speak, Varya, his brother’s wife, was alone\\nin the room.\\n\\n“Varya,” he said, looking sternly at her, “I shot myself by accident.\\nAnd please never speak of it, and tell everyone so. Or else it’s too\\nridiculous.”\\n\\nWithout answering his words, Varya bent over him, and with a delighted\\nsmile gazed into his face. His eyes were clear, not feverish; but their\\nexpression was stern.\\n\\n“Thank God!” she said. “You’re not in pain?”\\n\\n“A little here.” He pointed to his breast.\\n\\n“Then let me change your bandages.”\\n\\nIn silence, stiffening his broad jaws, he looked at her while she\\nbandaged him up. When she had finished he said:\\n\\n“I’m not delirious. Please manage that there may be no talk of my\\nhaving shot myself on purpose.”\\n\\n“No one does say so. Only I hope you won’t shoot yourself by accident\\nany more,” she said, with a questioning smile.\\n\\n“Of course I won’t, but it would have been better....”\\n\\nAnd he smiled gloomily.\\n\\nIn spite of these words and this smile, which so frightened Varya, when\\nthe inflammation was over and he began to recover, he felt that he was\\ncompletely free from one part of his misery. By his action he had, as\\nit were, washed away the shame and humiliation he had felt before. He\\ncould now think calmly of Alexey Alexandrovitch. He recognized all his\\nmagnanimity, but he did not now feel himself humiliated by it. Besides,\\nhe got back again into the beaten track of his life. He saw the\\npossibility of looking men in the face again without shame, and he\\ncould live in accordance with his own habits. One thing he could not\\npluck out of his heart, though he never ceased struggling with it, was\\nthe regret, amounting to despair, that he had lost her forever. That\\nnow, having expiated his sin against the husband, he was bound to\\nrenounce her, and never in future to stand between her with her\\nrepentance and her husband, he had firmly decided in his heart; but he\\ncould not tear out of his heart his regret at the loss of her love, he\\ncould not erase from his memory those moments of happiness that he had\\nso little prized at the time, and that haunted him in all their charm.\\n\\nSerpuhovskoy had planned his appointment at Tashkend, and Vronsky\\nagreed to the proposition without the slightest hesitation. But the\\nnearer the time of departure came, the bitterer was the sacrifice he\\nwas making to what he thought his duty.\\n\\nHis wound had healed, and he was driving about making preparations for\\nhis departure for Tashkend.\\n\\n“To see her once and then to bury myself, to die,” he thought, and as\\nhe was paying farewell visits, he uttered this thought to Betsy.\\nCharged with this commission, Betsy had gone to Anna, and brought him\\nback a negative reply.\\n\\n“So much the better,” thought Vronsky, when he received the news. “It\\nwas a weakness, which would have shattered what strength I have left.”\\n\\nNext day Betsy herself came to him in the morning, and announced that\\nshe had heard through Oblonsky as a positive fact that Alexey\\nAlexandrovitch had agreed to a divorce, and that therefore Vronsky\\ncould see Anna.\\n\\nWithout even troubling himself to see Betsy out of his flat, forgetting\\nall his resolutions, without asking when he could see her, where her\\nhusband was, Vronsky drove straight to the Karenins’. He ran up the\\nstairs seeing no one and nothing, and with a rapid step, almost\\nbreaking into a run, he went into her room. And without considering,\\nwithout noticing whether there was anyone in the room or not, he flung\\nhis arms round her, and began to cover her face, her hands, her neck\\nwith kisses.\\n\\nAnna had been preparing herself for this meeting, had thought what she\\nwould say to him, but she did not succeed in saying anything of it; his\\npassion mastered her. She tried to calm him, to calm herself, but it\\nwas too late. His feeling infected her. Her lips trembled so that for a\\nlong while she could say nothing.\\n\\n“Yes, you have conquered me, and I am yours,” she said at last,\\npressing his hands to her bosom.\\n\\n“So it had to be,” he said. “So long as we live, it must be so. I know\\nit now.”\\n\\n“That’s true,” she said, getting whiter and whiter, and embracing his\\nhead. “Still there is something terrible in it after all that has\\nhappened.”\\n\\n“It will all pass, it will all pass; we shall be so happy. Our love, if\\nit could be stronger, will be strengthened by there being something\\nterrible in it,” he said, lifting his head and parting his strong teeth\\nin a smile.\\n\\nAnd she could not but respond with a smile—not to his words, but to the\\nlove in his eyes. She took his hand and stroked her chilled cheeks and\\ncropped head with it.\\n\\n“I don’t know you with this short hair. You’ve grown so pretty. A boy.\\nBut how pale you are!”\\n\\n“Yes, I’m very weak,” she said, smiling. And her lips began trembling\\nagain.\\n\\n“We’ll go to Italy; you will get strong,” he said.\\n\\n“Can it be possible we could be like husband and wife, alone, your\\nfamily with you?” she said, looking close into his eyes.\\n\\n“It only seems strange to me that it can ever have been otherwise.”\\n\\n“Stiva says that _he_ has agreed to everything, but I can’t accept\\n_his_ generosity,” she said, looking dreamily past Vronsky’s face. “I\\ndon’t want a divorce; it’s all the same to me now. Only I don’t know\\nwhat he will decide about Seryozha.”\\n\\nHe could not conceive how at this moment of their meeting she could\\nremember and think of her son, of divorce. What did it all matter?\\n\\n“Don’t speak of that, don’t think of it,” he said, turning her hand in\\nhis, and trying to draw her attention to him; but still she did not\\nlook at him.\\n\\n“Oh, why didn’t I die! it would have been better,” she said, and silent\\ntears flowed down both her cheeks; but she tried to smile, so as not to\\nwound him.\\n\\nTo decline the flattering and dangerous appointment at Tashkend would\\nhave been, Vronsky had till then considered, disgraceful and\\nimpossible. But now, without an instant’s consideration, he declined\\nit, and observing dissatisfaction in the most exalted quarters at this\\nstep, he immediately retired from the army.\\n\\nA month later Alexey Alexandrovitch was left alone with his son in his\\nhouse at Petersburg, while Anna and Vronsky had gone abroad, not having\\nobtained a divorce, but having absolutely declined all idea of one.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPART FIVE 1\\n\\n\\nPrincess Shtcherbatskaya considered that it was out of the question for\\nthe wedding to take place before Lent, just five weeks off, since not\\nhalf the trousseau could possibly be ready by that time. But she could\\nnot but agree with Levin that to fix it for after Lent would be putting\\nit off too late, as an old aunt of Prince Shtcherbatsky’s was seriously\\nill and might die, and then the mourning would delay the wedding still\\nlonger. And therefore, deciding to divide the trousseau into two\\nparts—a larger and smaller trousseau—the princess consented to have the\\nwedding before Lent. She determined that she would get the smaller part\\nof the trousseau all ready now, and the larger part should be made\\nlater, and she was much vexed with Levin because he was incapable of\\ngiving her a serious answer to the question whether he agreed to this\\narrangement or not. The arrangement was the more suitable as,\\nimmediately after the wedding, the young people were to go to the\\ncountry, where the more important part of the trousseau would not be\\nwanted.\\n\\nLevin still continued in the same delirious condition in which it\\nseemed to him that he and his happiness constituted the chief and sole\\naim of all existence, and that he need not now think or care about\\nanything, that everything was being done and would be done for him by\\nothers. He had not even plans and aims for the future, he left its\\narrangement to others, knowing that everything would be delightful. His\\nbrother Sergey Ivanovitch, Stepan Arkadyevitch, and the princess guided\\nhim in doing what he had to do. All he did was to agree entirely with\\neverything suggested to him. His brother raised money for him, the\\nprincess advised him to leave Moscow after the wedding. Stepan\\nArkadyevitch advised him to go abroad. He agreed to everything. “Do\\nwhat you choose, if it amuses you. I’m happy, and my happiness can be\\nno greater and no less for anything you do,” he thought. When he told\\nKitty of Stepan Arkadyevitch’s advice that they should go abroad, he\\nwas much surprised that she did not agree to this, and had some\\ndefinite requirements of her own in regard to their future. She knew\\nLevin had work he loved in the country. She did not, as he saw,\\nunderstand this work, she did not even care to understand it. But that\\ndid not prevent her from regarding it as a matter of great importance.\\nAnd then she knew their home would be in the country, and she wanted to\\ngo, not abroad where she was not going to live, but to the place where\\ntheir home would be. This definitely expressed purpose astonished\\nLevin. But since he did not care either way, he immediately asked\\nStepan Arkadyevitch, as though it were his duty, to go down to the\\ncountry and to arrange everything there to the best of his ability with\\nthe taste of which he had so much.\\n\\n“But I say,” Stepan Arkadyevitch said to him one day after he had come\\nback from the country, where he had got everything ready for the young\\npeople’s arrival, “have you a certificate of having been at\\nconfession?”\\n\\n“No. But what of it?”\\n\\n“You can’t be married without it.”\\n\\n“_Aïe, aïe, aïe!_” cried Levin. “Why, I believe it’s nine years since\\nI’ve taken the sacrament! I never thought of it.”\\n\\n“You’re a pretty fellow!” said Stepan Arkadyevitch laughing, “and you\\ncall me a Nihilist! But this won’t do, you know. You must take the\\nsacrament.”\\n\\n“When? There are four days left now.”\\n\\nStepan Arkadyevitch arranged this also, and Levin had to go to\\nconfession. To Levin, as to any unbeliever who respects the beliefs of\\nothers, it was exceedingly disagreeable to be present at and take part\\nin church ceremonies. At this moment, in his present softened state of\\nfeeling, sensitive to everything, this inevitable act of hypocrisy was\\nnot merely painful to Levin, it seemed to him utterly impossible. Now,\\nin the heyday of his highest glory, his fullest flower, he would have\\nto be a liar or a scoffer. He felt incapable of being either. But\\nthough he repeatedly plied Stepan Arkadyevitch with questions as to the\\npossibility of obtaining a certificate without actually communicating,\\nStepan Arkadyevitch maintained that it was out of the question.\\n\\n“Besides, what is it to you—two days? And he’s an awfully nice clever\\nold fellow. He’ll pull the tooth out for you so gently, you won’t\\nnotice it.”\\n\\nStanding at the first litany, Levin attempted to revive in himself his\\nyouthful recollections of the intense religious emotion he had passed\\nthrough between the ages of sixteen and seventeen.\\n\\nBut he was at once convinced that it was utterly impossible to him. He\\nattempted to look at it all as an empty custom, having no sort of\\nmeaning, like the custom of paying calls. But he felt that he could not\\ndo that either. Levin found himself, like the majority of his\\ncontemporaries, in the vaguest position in regard to religion. Believe\\nhe could not, and at the same time he had no firm conviction that it\\nwas all wrong. And consequently, not being able to believe in the\\nsignificance of what he was doing nor to regard it with indifference as\\nan empty formality, during the whole period of preparing for the\\nsacrament he was conscious of a feeling of discomfort and shame at\\ndoing what he did not himself understand, and what, as an inner voice\\ntold him, was therefore false and wrong.\\n\\nDuring the service he would first listen to the prayers, trying to\\nattach some meaning to them not discordant with his own views; then\\nfeeling that he could not understand and must condemn them, he tried\\nnot to listen to them, but to attend to the thoughts, observations, and\\nmemories which floated through his brain with extreme vividness during\\nthis idle time of standing in church.\\n\\nHe had stood through the litany, the evening service and the midnight\\nservice, and the next day he got up earlier than usual, and without\\nhaving tea went at eight o’clock in the morning to the church for the\\nmorning service and the confession.\\n\\nThere was no one in the church but a beggar soldier, two old women, and\\nthe church officials. A young deacon, whose long back showed in two\\ndistinct halves through his thin undercassock, met him, and at once\\ngoing to a little table at the wall read the exhortation. During the\\nreading, especially at the frequent and rapid repetition of the same\\nwords, “Lord, have mercy on us!” which resounded with an echo, Levin\\nfelt that thought was shut and sealed up, and that it must not be\\ntouched or stirred now or confusion would be the result; and so\\nstanding behind the deacon he went on thinking of his own affairs,\\nneither listening nor examining what was said. “It’s wonderful what\\nexpression there is in her hand,” he thought, remembering how they had\\nbeen sitting the day before at a corner table. They had nothing to talk\\nabout, as was almost always the case at this time, and laying her hand\\non the table she kept opening and shutting it, and laughed herself as\\nshe watched her action. He remembered how he had kissed it and then had\\nexamined the lines on the pink palm. “Have mercy on us again!” thought\\nLevin, crossing himself, bowing, and looking at the supple spring of\\nthe deacon’s back bowing before him. “She took my hand then and\\nexamined the lines. ‘You’ve got a splendid hand,’ she said.” And he\\nlooked at his own hand and the short hand of the deacon. “Yes, now it\\nwill soon be over,” he thought. “No, it seems to be beginning again,”\\nhe thought, listening to the prayers. “No, it’s just ending: there he\\nis bowing down to the ground. That’s always at the end.”\\n\\nThe deacon’s hand in a plush cuff accepted a three-rouble note\\nunobtrusively, and the deacon said he would put it down in the\\nregister, and his new boots creaking jauntily over the flagstones of\\nthe empty church, he went to the altar. A moment later he peeped out\\nthence and beckoned to Levin. Thought, till then locked up, began to\\nstir in Levin’s head, but he made haste to drive it away. “It will come\\nright somehow,” he thought, and went towards the altar-rails. He went\\nup the steps, and turning to the right saw the priest. The priest, a\\nlittle old man with a scanty grizzled beard and weary, good-natured\\neyes, was standing at the altar-rails, turning over the pages of a\\nmissal. With a slight bow to Levin he began immediately reading prayers\\nin the official voice. When he had finished them he bowed down to the\\nground and turned, facing Levin.\\n\\n“Christ is present here unseen, receiving your confession,” he said,\\npointing to the crucifix. “Do you believe in all the doctrines of the\\nHoly Apostolic Church?” the priest went on, turning his eyes away from\\nLevin’s face and folding his hands under his stole.\\n\\n“I have doubted, I doubt everything,” said Levin in a voice that jarred\\non himself, and he ceased speaking.\\n\\nThe priest waited a few seconds to see if he would not say more, and\\nclosing his eyes he said quickly, with a broad, Vladimirsky accent:\\n\\n“Doubt is natural to the weakness of mankind, but we must pray that God\\nin His mercy will strengthen us. What are your special sins?” he added,\\nwithout the slightest interval, as though anxious not to waste time.\\n\\n“My chief sin is doubt. I have doubts of everything, and for the most\\npart I am in doubt.”\\n\\n“Doubt is natural to the weakness of mankind,” the priest repeated the\\nsame words. “What do you doubt about principally?”\\n\\n“I doubt of everything. I sometimes even have doubts of the existence\\nof God,” Levin could not help saying, and he was horrified at the\\nimpropriety of what he was saying. But Levin’s words did not, it\\nseemed, make much impression on the priest.\\n\\n“What sort of doubt can there be of the existence of God?” he said\\nhurriedly, with a just perceptible smile.\\n\\nLevin did not speak.\\n\\n“What doubt can you have of the Creator when you behold His creation?”\\nthe priest went on in the rapid customary jargon. “Who has decked the\\nheavenly firmament with its lights? Who has clothed the earth in its\\nbeauty? How explain it without the Creator?” he said, looking\\ninquiringly at Levin.\\n\\nLevin felt that it would be improper to enter upon a metaphysical\\ndiscussion with the priest, and so he said in reply merely what was a\\ndirect answer to the question.\\n\\n“I don’t know,” he said.\\n\\n“You don’t know! Then how can you doubt that God created all?” the\\npriest said, with good-humored perplexity.\\n\\n“I don’t understand it at all,” said Levin, blushing, and feeling that\\nhis words were stupid, and that they could not be anything but stupid\\nin such a position.\\n\\n“Pray to God and beseech Him. Even the holy fathers had doubts, and\\nprayed to God to strengthen their faith. The devil has great power, and\\nwe must resist him. Pray to God, beseech Him. Pray to God,” he repeated\\nhurriedly.\\n\\nThe priest paused for some time, as though meditating.\\n\\n“You’re about, I hear, to marry the daughter of my parishioner and son\\nin the spirit, Prince Shtcherbatsky?” he resumed, with a smile. “An\\nexcellent young lady.”\\n\\n“Yes,” answered Levin, blushing for the priest. “What does he want to\\nask me about this at confession for?” he thought.\\n\\nAnd, as though answering his thought, the priest said to him:\\n\\n“You are about to enter into holy matrimony, and God may bless you with\\noffspring. Well, what sort of bringing-up can you give your babes if\\nyou do not overcome the temptation of the devil, enticing you to\\ninfidelity?” he said, with gentle reproachfulness. “If you love your\\nchild as a good father, you will not desire only wealth, luxury, honor\\nfor your infant; you will be anxious for his salvation, his spiritual\\nenlightenment with the light of truth. Eh? What answer will you make\\nhim when the innocent babe asks you: ‘Papa! who made all that enchants\\nme in this world—the earth, the waters, the sun, the flowers, the\\ngrass?’ Can you say to him: ‘I don’t know’? You cannot but know, since\\nthe Lord God in His infinite mercy has revealed it to us. Or your child\\nwill ask you: ‘What awaits me in the life beyond the tomb?’ What will\\nyou say to him when you know nothing? How will you answer him? Will you\\nleave him to the allurements of the world and the devil? That’s not\\nright,” he said, and he stopped, putting his head on one side and\\nlooking at Levin with his kindly, gentle eyes.\\n\\nLevin made no answer this time, not because he did not want to enter\\nupon a discussion with the priest, but because, so far, no one had ever\\nasked him such questions, and when his babes did ask him those\\nquestions, it would be time enough to think about answering them.\\n\\n“You are entering upon a time of life,” pursued the priest, “when you\\nmust choose your path and keep to it. Pray to God that He may in His\\nmercy aid you and have mercy on you!” he concluded. “Our Lord and God,\\nJesus Christ, in the abundance and riches of His loving-kindness,\\nforgives this child....” and, finishing the prayer of absolution, the\\npriest blessed him and dismissed him.\\n\\nOn getting home that day, Levin had a delightful sense of relief at the\\nawkward position being over and having been got through without his\\nhaving to tell a lie. Apart from this, there remained a vague memory\\nthat what the kind, nice old fellow had said had not been at all so\\nstupid as he had fancied at first, and that there was something in it\\nthat must be cleared up.\\n\\n“Of course, not now,” thought Levin, “but some day later on.” Levin\\nfelt more than ever now that there was something not clear and not\\nclean in his soul, and that, in regard to religion, he was in the same\\nposition which he perceived so clearly and disliked in others, and for\\nwhich he blamed his friend Sviazhsky.\\n\\nLevin spent that evening with his betrothed at Dolly’s, and was in very\\nhigh spirits. To explain to Stepan Arkadyevitch the state of excitement\\nin which he found himself, he said that he was happy like a dog being\\ntrained to jump through a hoop, who, having at last caught the idea,\\nand done what was required of him, whines and wags its tail, and jumps\\nup to the table and the windows in its delight 2\\n\\nOn the day of the wedding, according to the Russian custom (the\\nprincess and Darya Alexandrovna insisted on strictly keeping all the\\ncustoms), Levin did not see his betrothed, and dined at his hotel with\\nthree bachelor friends, casually brought together at his rooms. These\\nwere Sergey Ivanovitch, Katavasov, a university friend, now professor\\nof natural science, whom Levin had met in the street and insisted on\\ntaking home with him, and Tchirikov, his best man, a Moscow\\nconciliation-board judge, Levin’s companion in his bear-hunts. The\\ndinner was a very merry one: Sergey Ivanovitch was in his happiest\\nmood, and was much amused by Katavasov’s originality. Katavasov,\\nfeeling his originality was appreciated and understood, made the most\\nof it. Tchirikov always gave a lively and good-humored support to\\nconversation of any sort.\\n\\n“See, now,” said Katavasov, drawling his words from a habit acquired in\\nthe lecture-room, “what a capable fellow was our friend Konstantin\\nDmitrievitch. I’m not speaking of present company, for he’s absent. At\\nthe time he left the university he was fond of science, took an\\ninterest in humanity; now one-half of his abilities is devoted to\\ndeceiving himself, and the other to justifying the deceit.”\\n\\n“A more determined enemy of matrimony than you I never saw,” said\\nSergey Ivanovitch.\\n\\n“Oh, no, I’m not an enemy of matrimony. I’m in favor of division of\\nlabor. People who can do nothing else ought to rear people while the\\nrest work for their happiness and enlightenment. That’s how I look at\\nit. To muddle up two trades is the error of the amateur; I’m not one of\\ntheir number.”\\n\\n“How happy I shall be when I hear that you’re in love!” said Levin.\\n“Please invite me to the wedding.”\\n\\n“I’m in love now.”\\n\\n“Yes, with a cuttlefish! You know,” Levin turned to his brother,\\n“Mihail Semyonovitch is writing a work on the digestive organs of\\nthe....”\\n\\n“Now, make a muddle of it! It doesn’t matter what about. And the fact\\nis, I certainly do love cuttlefish.”\\n\\n“But that’s no hindrance to your loving your wife.”\\n\\n“The cuttlefish is no hindrance. The wife is the hindrance.”\\n\\n“Why so?”\\n\\n“Oh, you’ll see! You care about farming, hunting,—well, you’d better\\nlook out!”\\n\\n“Arhip was here today; he said there were a lot of elks in Prudno, and\\ntwo bears,” said Tchirikov.\\n\\n“Well, you must go and get them without me.”\\n\\n“Ah, that’s the truth,” said Sergey Ivanovitch. “And you may say\\ngood-bye to bear-hunting for the future—your wife won’t allow it!”\\n\\nLevin smiled. The picture of his wife not letting him go was so\\npleasant that he was ready to renounce the delights of looking upon\\nbears forever.\\n\\n“Still, it’s a pity they should get those two bears without you. Do you\\nremember last time at Hapilovo? That was a delightful hunt!” said\\nTchirikov.\\n\\nLevin had not the heart to disillusion him of the notion that there\\ncould be something delightful apart from her, and so said nothing.\\n\\n“There’s some sense in this custom of saying good-bye to bachelor\\nlife,” said Sergey Ivanovitch. “However happy you may be, you must\\nregret your freedom.”\\n\\n“And confess there is a feeling that you want to jump out of the\\nwindow, like Gogol’s bridegroom?”\\n\\n“Of course there is, but it isn’t confessed,” said Katavasov, and he\\nbroke into loud laughter.\\n\\n“Oh, well, the window’s open. Let’s start off this instant to Tver!\\nThere’s a big she-bear; one can go right up to the lair. Seriously,\\nlet’s go by the five o’clock! And here let them do what they like,”\\nsaid Tchirikov, smiling.\\n\\n“Well, now, on my honor,” said Levin, smiling, “I can’t find in my\\nheart that feeling of regret for my freedom.”\\n\\n“Yes, there’s such a chaos in your heart just now that you can’t find\\nanything there,” said Katavasov. “Wait a bit, when you set it to rights\\na little, you’ll find it!”\\n\\n“No; if so, I should have felt a little, apart from my feeling” (he\\ncould not say love before them) “and happiness, a certain regret at\\nlosing my freedom.... On the contrary, I am glad at the very loss of my\\nfreedom.”\\n\\n“Awful! It’s a hopeless case!” said Katavasov. “Well, let’s drink to\\nhis recovery, or wish that a hundredth part of his dreams may be\\nrealized—and that would be happiness such as never has been seen on\\nearth!”\\n\\nSoon after dinner the guests went away to be in time to be dressed for\\nthe wedding.\\n\\nWhen he was left alone, and recalled the conversation of these bachelor\\nfriends, Levin asked himself: had he in his heart that regret for his\\nfreedom of which they had spoken? He smiled at the question. “Freedom!\\nWhat is freedom for? Happiness is only in loving and wishing her\\nwishes, thinking her thoughts, that is to say, not freedom at\\nall—that’s happiness!”\\n\\n“But do I know her ideas, her wishes, her feelings?” some voice\\nsuddenly whispered to him. The smile died away from his face, and he\\ngrew thoughtful. And suddenly a strange feeling came upon him. There\\ncame over him a dread and doubt—doubt of everything.\\n\\n“What if she does not love me? What if she’s marrying me simply to be\\nmarried? What if she doesn’t see herself what she’s doing?” he asked\\nhimself. “She may come to her senses, and only when she is being\\nmarried realize that she does not and cannot love me.” And strange,\\nmost evil thoughts of her began to come to him. He was jealous of\\nVronsky, as he had been a year ago, as though the evening he had seen\\nher with Vronsky had been yesterday. He suspected she had not told him\\neverything.\\n\\nHe jumped up quickly. “No, this can’t go on!” he said to himself in\\ndespair. “I’ll go to her; I’ll ask her; I’ll say for the last time: we\\nare free, and hadn’t we better stay so? Anything’s better than endless\\nmisery, disgrace, unfaithfulness!” With despair in his heart and bitter\\nanger against all men, against himself, against her, he went out of the\\nhotel and drove to her house.\\n\\nHe found her in one of the back rooms. She was sitting on a chest and\\nmaking some arrangements with her maid, sorting over heaps of dresses\\nof different colors, spread on the backs of chairs and on the floor.\\n\\n“Ah!” she cried, seeing him, and beaming with delight. “Kostya!\\nKonstantin Dmitrievitch!” (These latter days she used these names\\nalmost alternately.) “I didn’t expect you! I’m going through my\\nwardrobe to see what’s for whom....”\\n\\n“Oh! that’s very nice!” he said gloomily, looking at the maid.\\n\\n“You can go, Dunyasha, I’ll call you presently,” said Kitty. “Kostya,\\nwhat’s the matter?” she asked, definitely adopting this familiar name\\nas soon as the maid had gone out. She noticed his strange face,\\nagitated and gloomy, and a panic came over her.\\n\\n“Kitty! I’m in torture. I can’t suffer alone,” he said with despair in\\nhis voice, standing before her and looking imploringly into her eyes.\\nHe saw already from her loving, truthful face, that nothing could come\\nof what he had meant to say, but yet he wanted her to reassure him\\nherself. “I’ve come to say that there’s still time. This can all be\\nstopped and set right.”\\n\\n“What? I don’t understand. What is the matter?”\\n\\n“What I have said a thousand times over, and can’t help thinking ...\\nthat I’m not worthy of you. You couldn’t consent to marry me. Think a\\nlittle. You’ve made a mistake. Think it over thoroughly. You can’t love\\nme.... If ... better say so,” he said, not looking at her. “I shall be\\nwretched. Let people say what they like; anything’s better than\\nmisery.... Far better now while there’s still time....”\\n\\n“I don’t understand,” she answered, panic-stricken; “you mean you want\\nto give it up ... don’t want it?”\\n\\n“Yes, if you don’t love me.”\\n\\n“You’re out of your mind!” she cried, turning crimson with vexation.\\nBut his face was so piteous, that she restrained her vexation, and\\nflinging some clothes off an armchair, she sat down beside him. “What\\nare you thinking? tell me all.”\\n\\n“I am thinking you can’t love me. What can you love me for?”\\n\\n“My God! what can I do?...” she said, and burst into tears.\\n\\n“Oh! what have I done?” he cried, and kneeling before her, he fell to\\nkissing her hands.\\n\\nWhen the princess came into the room five minutes later, she found them\\ncompletely reconciled. Kitty had not simply assured him that she loved\\nhim, but had gone so far—in answer to his question, what she loved him\\nfor—as to explain what for. She told him that she loved him because she\\nunderstood him completely, because she knew what he would like, and\\nbecause everything he liked was good. And this seemed to him perfectly\\nclear. When the princess came to them, they were sitting side by side\\non the chest, sorting the dresses and disputing over Kitty’s wanting to\\ngive Dunyasha the brown dress she had been wearing when Levin proposed\\nto her, while he insisted that that dress must never be given away, but\\nDunyasha must have the blue one.\\n\\n“How is it you don’t see? She’s a brunette, and it won’t suit her....\\nI’ve worked it all out.”\\n\\nHearing why he had come, the princess was half humorously, half\\nseriously angry with him, and sent him home to dress and not to hinder\\nKitty’s hair-dressing, as Charles the hair-dresser was just coming.\\n\\n“As it is, she’s been eating nothing lately and is losing her looks,\\nand then you must come and upset her with your nonsense,” she said to\\nhim. “Get along with you, my dear!”\\n\\nLevin, guilty and shamefaced, but pacified, went back to his hotel. His\\nbrother, Darya Alexandrovna, and Stepan Arkadyevitch, all in full\\ndress, were waiting for him to bless him with the holy picture. There\\nwas no time to lose. Darya Alexandrovna had to drive home again to\\nfetch her curled and pomaded son, who was to carry the holy pictures\\nafter the bride. Then a carriage had to be sent for the best man, and\\nanother that would take Sergey Ivanovitch away would have to be sent\\nback.... Altogether there were a great many most complicated matters to\\nbe considered and arranged. One thing was unmistakable, that there must\\nbe no delay, as it was already half-past six.\\n\\nNothing special happened at the ceremony of benediction with the holy\\npicture. Stepan Arkadyevitch stood in a comically solemn pose beside\\nhis wife, took the holy picture, and telling Levin to bow down to the\\nground, he blessed him with his kindly, ironical smile, and kissed him\\nthree times; Darya Alexandrovna did the same, and immediately was in a\\nhurry to get off, and again plunged into the intricate question of the\\ndestinations of the various carriages.\\n\\n“Come, I’ll tell you how we’ll manage: you drive in our carriage to\\nfetch him, and Sergey Ivanovitch, if he’ll be so good, will drive there\\nand then send his carriage.”\\n\\n“Of course; I shall be delighted.”\\n\\n“We’ll come on directly with him. Are your things sent off?” said\\nStepan Arkadyevitch.\\n\\n“Yes,” answered Levin, and he told Kouzma to put out his clothes for\\nhim to dress 3\\n\\nA crowd of people, principally women, was thronging round the church\\nlighted up for the wedding. Those who had not succeeded in getting into\\nthe main entrance were crowding about the windows, pushing, wrangling,\\nand peeping through the gratings.\\n\\nMore than twenty carriages had already been drawn up in ranks along the\\nstreet by the police. A police officer, regardless of the frost, stood\\nat the entrance, gorgeous in his uniform. More carriages were\\ncontinually driving up, and ladies wearing flowers and carrying their\\ntrains, and men taking off their helmets or black hats kept walking\\ninto the church. Inside the church both lusters were already lighted,\\nand all the candles before the holy pictures. The gilt on the red\\nground of the holy picture-stand, and the gilt relief on the pictures,\\nand the silver of the lusters and candlesticks, and the stones of the\\nfloor, and the rugs, and the banners above in the choir, and the steps\\nof the altar, and the old blackened books, and the cassocks and\\nsurplices—all were flooded with light. On the right side of the warm\\nchurch, in the crowd of frock coats and white ties, uniforms and\\nbroadcloth, velvet, satin, hair and flowers, bare shoulders and arms\\nand long gloves, there was discreet but lively conversation that echoed\\nstrangely in the high cupola. Every time there was heard the creak of\\nthe opened door the conversation in the crowd died away, and everybody\\nlooked round expecting to see the bride and bridegroom come in. But the\\ndoor had opened more than ten times, and each time it was either a\\nbelated guest or guests, who joined the circle of the invited on the\\nright, or a spectator, who had eluded or softened the police officer,\\nand went to join the crowd of outsiders on the left. Both the guests\\nand the outside public had by now passed through all the phases of\\nanticipation.\\n\\nAt first they imagined that the bride and bridegroom would arrive\\nimmediately, and attached no importance at all to their being late.\\nThen they began to look more and more often towards the door, and to\\ntalk of whether anything could have happened. Then the long delay began\\nto be positively discomforting, and relations and guests tried to look\\nas if they were not thinking of the bridegroom but were engrossed in\\nconversation.\\n\\nThe head deacon, as though to remind them of the value of his time,\\ncoughed impatiently, making the window-panes quiver in their frames. In\\nthe choir the bored choristers could be heard trying their voices and\\nblowing their noses. The priest was continually sending first the\\nbeadle and then the deacon to find out whether the bridegroom had not\\ncome, more and more often he went himself, in a lilac vestment and an\\nembroidered sash, to the side door, expecting to see the bridegroom. At\\nlast one of the ladies, glancing at her watch, said, “It really is\\nstrange, though!” and all the guests became uneasy and began loudly\\nexpressing their wonder and dissatisfaction. One of the bridegroom’s\\nbest men went to find out what had happened. Kitty meanwhile had long\\nago been quite ready, and in her white dress and long veil and wreath\\nof orange blossoms she was standing in the drawing-room of the\\nShtcherbatskys’ house with her sister, Madame Lvova, who was her\\nbridal-mother. She was looking out of the window, and had been for over\\nhalf an hour anxiously expecting to hear from the best man that her\\nbridegroom was at the church.\\n\\nLevin meanwhile, in his trousers, but without his coat and waistcoat,\\nwas walking to and fro in his room at the hotel, continually putting\\nhis head out of the door and looking up and down the corridor. But in\\nthe corridor there was no sign of the person he was looking for and he\\ncame back in despair, and frantically waving his hands addressed Stepan\\nArkadyevitch, who was smoking serenely.\\n\\n“Was ever a man in such a fearful fool’s position?” he said.\\n\\n“Yes, it is stupid,” Stepan Arkadyevitch assented, smiling soothingly.\\n“But don’t worry, it’ll be brought directly.”\\n\\n“No, what is to be done!” said Levin, with smothered fury. “And these\\nfools of open waistcoats! Out of the question!” he said, looking at the\\ncrumpled front of his shirt. “And what if the things have been taken on\\nto the railway station!” he roared in desperation.\\n\\n“Then you must put on mine.”\\n\\n“I ought to have done so long ago, if at all.”\\n\\n“It’s not nice to look ridiculous.... Wait a bit! it will _come\\nround_.”\\n\\nThe point was that when Levin asked for his evening suit, Kouzma, his\\nold servant, had brought him the coat, waistcoat, and everything that\\nwas wanted.\\n\\n“But the shirt!” cried Levin.\\n\\n“You’ve got a shirt on,” Kouzma answered, with a placid smile.\\n\\nKouzma had not thought of leaving out a clean shirt, and on receiving\\ninstructions to pack up everything and send it round to the\\nShtcherbatskys’ house, from which the young people were to set out the\\nsame evening, he had done so, packing everything but the dress suit.\\nThe shirt worn since the morning was crumpled and out of the question\\nwith the fashionable open waistcoat. It was a long way to send to the\\nShtcherbatskys’. They sent out to buy a shirt. The servant came back;\\neverything was shut up—it was Sunday. They sent to Stepan\\nArkadyevitch’s and brought a shirt—it was impossibly wide and short.\\nThey sent finally to the Shtcherbatskys’ to unpack the things. The\\nbridegroom was expected at the church while he was pacing up and down\\nhis room like a wild beast in a cage, peeping out into the corridor,\\nand with horror and despair recalling what absurd things he had said to\\nKitty and what she might be thinking now.\\n\\nAt last the guilty Kouzma flew panting into the room with the shirt.\\n\\n“Only just in time. They were just lifting it into the van,” said\\nKouzma.\\n\\nThree minutes later Levin ran full speed into the corridor, not looking\\nat his watch for fear of aggravating his sufferings.\\n\\n“You won’t help matters like this,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch with a\\nsmile, hurrying with more deliberation after him. “It will come round,\\nit will come round ... I tell you 4\\n\\n“They’ve come!” “Here he is!” “Which one?” “Rather young, eh?” “Why, my\\ndear soul, she looks more dead than alive!” were the comments in the\\ncrowd, when Levin, meeting his bride in the entrance, walked with her\\ninto the church.\\n\\nStepan Arkadyevitch told his wife the cause of the delay, and the\\nguests were whispering it with smiles to one another. Levin saw nothing\\nand no one; he did not take his eyes off his bride.\\n\\nEveryone said she had lost her looks dreadfully of late, and was not\\nnearly so pretty on her wedding day as usual; but Levin did not think\\nso. He looked at her hair done up high, with the long white veil and\\nwhite flowers and the high, stand-up, scalloped collar, that in such a\\nmaidenly fashion hid her long neck at the sides and only showed it in\\nfront, her strikingly slender figure, and it seemed to him that she\\nlooked better than ever—not because these flowers, this veil, this gown\\nfrom Paris added anything to her beauty; but because, in spite of the\\nelaborate sumptuousness of her attire, the expression of her sweet\\nface, of her eyes, of her lips was still her own characteristic\\nexpression of guileless truthfulness.\\n\\n“I was beginning to think you meant to run away,” she said, and smiled\\nto him.\\n\\n“It’s so stupid, what happened to me, I’m ashamed to speak of it!” he\\nsaid, reddening, and he was obliged to turn to Sergey Ivanovitch, who\\ncame up to him.\\n\\n“This is a pretty story of yours about the shirt!” said Sergey\\nIvanovitch, shaking his head and smiling.\\n\\n“Yes, yes!” answered Levin, without an idea of what they were talking\\nabout.\\n\\n“Now, Kostya, you have to decide,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch with an air\\nof mock dismay, “a weighty question. You are at this moment just in the\\nhumor to appreciate all its gravity. They ask me, are they to light the\\ncandles that have been lighted before or candles that have never been\\nlighted? It’s a matter of ten roubles,” he added, relaxing his lips\\ninto a smile. “I have decided, but I was afraid you might not agree.”\\n\\nLevin saw it was a joke, but he could not smile.\\n\\n“Well, how’s it to be then?—unlighted or lighted candles? that’s the\\nquestion.”\\n\\n“Yes, yes, unlighted.”\\n\\n“Oh, I’m very glad. The question’s decided!” said Stepan Arkadyevitch,\\nsmiling. “How silly men are, though, in this position,” he said to\\nTchirikov, when Levin, after looking absently at him, had moved back to\\nhis bride.\\n\\n“Kitty, mind you’re the first to step on the carpet,” said Countess\\nNordston, coming up. “You’re a nice person!” she said to Levin.\\n\\n“Aren’t you frightened, eh?” said Marya Dmitrievna, an old aunt.\\n\\n“Are you cold? You’re pale. Stop a minute, stoop down,” said Kitty’s\\nsister, Madame Lvova, and with her plump, handsome arms she smilingly\\nset straight the flowers on her head.\\n\\nDolly came up, tried to say something, but could not speak, cried, and\\nthen laughed unnaturally.\\n\\nKitty looked at all of them with the same absent eyes as Levin.\\n\\nMeanwhile the officiating clergy had got into their vestments, and the\\npriest and deacon came out to the lectern, which stood in the forepart\\nof the church. The priest turned to Levin saying something. Levin did\\nnot hear what the priest said.\\n\\n“Take the bride’s hand and lead her up,” the best man said to Levin.\\n\\nIt was a long while before Levin could make out what was expected of\\nhim. For a long time they tried to set him right and made him begin\\nagain—because he kept taking Kitty by the wrong arm or with the wrong\\narm—till he understood at last that what he had to do was, without\\nchanging his position, to take her right hand in his right hand. When\\nat last he had taken the bride’s hand in the correct way, the priest\\nwalked a few paces in front of them and stopped at the lectern. The\\ncrowd of friends and relations moved after them, with a buzz of talk\\nand a rustle of skirts. Someone stooped down and pulled out the bride’s\\ntrain. The church became so still that the drops of wax could be heard\\nfalling from the candles.\\n\\nThe little old priest in his ecclesiastical cap, with his long\\nsilvery-gray locks of hair parted behind his ears, was fumbling with\\nsomething at the lectern, putting out his little old hands from under\\nthe heavy silver vestment with the gold cross on the back of it.\\n\\nStepan Arkadyevitch approached him cautiously, whispered something, and\\nmaking a sign to Levin, walked back again.\\n\\nThe priest lighted two candles, wreathed with flowers, and holding them\\nsideways so that the wax dropped slowly from them he turned, facing the\\nbridal pair. The priest was the same old man that had confessed Levin.\\nHe looked with weary and melancholy eyes at the bride and bridegroom,\\nsighed, and putting his right hand out from his vestment, blessed the\\nbridegroom with it, and also with a shade of solicitous tenderness laid\\nthe crossed fingers on the bowed head of Kitty. Then he gave them the\\ncandles, and taking the censer, moved slowly away from them.\\n\\n“Can it be true?” thought Levin, and he looked round at his bride.\\nLooking down at her he saw her face in profile, and from the scarcely\\nperceptible quiver of her lips and eyelashes he knew she was aware of\\nhis eyes upon her. She did not look round, but the high scalloped\\ncollar, that reached her little pink ear, trembled faintly. He saw that\\na sigh was held back in her throat, and the little hand in the long\\nglove shook as it held the candle.\\n\\nAll the fuss of the shirt, of being late, all the talk of friends and\\nrelations, their annoyance, his ludicrous position—all suddenly passed\\naway and he was filled with joy and dread.\\n\\nThe handsome, stately head-deacon wearing a silver robe and his curly\\nlocks standing out at each side of his head, stepped smartly forward,\\nand lifting his stole on two fingers, stood opposite the priest.\\n\\n“Blessed be the name of the Lord,” the solemn syllables rang out slowly\\none after another, setting the air quivering with waves of sound.\\n\\n“Blessed is the name of our God, from the beginning, is now, and ever\\nshall be,” the little old priest answered in a submissive, piping\\nvoice, still fingering something at the lectern. And the full chorus of\\nthe unseen choir rose up, filling the whole church, from the windows to\\nthe vaulted roof, with broad waves of melody. It grew stronger, rested\\nfor an instant, and slowly died away.\\n\\nThey prayed, as they always do, for peace from on high and for\\nsalvation, for the Holy Synod, and for the Tsar; they prayed, too, for\\nthe servants of God, Konstantin and Ekaterina, now plighting their\\ntroth.\\n\\n“Vouchsafe to them love made perfect, peace and help, O Lord, we\\nbeseech Thee,” the whole church seemed to breathe with the voice of the\\nhead deacon.\\n\\nLevin heard the words, and they impressed him. “How did they guess that\\nit is help, just help that one wants?” he thought, recalling all his\\nfears and doubts of late. “What do I know? what can I do in this\\nfearful business,” he thought, “without help? Yes, it is help I want\\nnow.”\\n\\nWhen the deacon had finished the prayer for the Imperial family, the\\npriest turned to the bridal pair with a book: “Eternal God, that\\njoinest together in love them that were separate,” he read in a gentle,\\npiping voice: “who hast ordained the union of holy wedlock that cannot\\nbe set asunder, Thou who didst bless Isaac and Rebecca and their\\ndescendants, according to Thy Holy Covenant; bless Thy servants,\\nKonstantin and Ekaterina, leading them in the path of all good works.\\nFor gracious and merciful art Thou, our Lord, and glory be to Thee, the\\nFather, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, now and ever shall be.”\\n\\n“Amen!” the unseen choir sent rolling again upon the air.\\n\\n“‘Joinest together in love them that were separate.’ What deep meaning\\nin those words, and how they correspond with what one feels at this\\nmoment,” thought Levin. “Is she feeling the same as I?”\\n\\nAnd looking round, he met her eyes, and from their expression he\\nconcluded that she was understanding it just as he was. But this was a\\nmistake; she almost completely missed the meaning of the words of the\\nservice; she had not heard them, in fact. She could not listen to them\\nand take them in, so strong was the one feeling that filled her breast\\nand grew stronger and stronger. That feeling was joy at the completion\\nof the process that for the last month and a half had been going on in\\nher soul, and had during those six weeks been a joy and a torture to\\nher. On the day when in the drawing-room of the house in Arbaty Street\\nshe had gone up to him in her brown dress, and given herself to him\\nwithout a word—on that day, at that hour, there took place in her heart\\na complete severance from all her old life, and a quite different, new,\\nutterly strange life had begun for her, while the old life was actually\\ngoing on as before. Those six weeks had for her been a time of the\\nutmost bliss and the utmost misery. All her life, all her desires and\\nhopes were concentrated on this one man, still uncomprehended by her,\\nto whom she was bound by a feeling of alternate attraction and\\nrepulsion, even less comprehended than the man himself, and all the\\nwhile she was going on living in the outward conditions of her old\\nlife. Living the old life, she was horrified at herself, at her utter\\ninsurmountable callousness to all her own past, to things, to habits,\\nto the people she had loved, who loved her—to her mother, who was\\nwounded by her indifference, to her kind, tender father, till then\\ndearer than all the world. At one moment she was horrified at this\\nindifference, at another she rejoiced at what had brought her to this\\nindifference. She could not frame a thought, not a wish apart from life\\nwith this man; but this new life was not yet, and she could not even\\npicture it clearly to herself. There was only anticipation, the dread\\nand joy of the new and the unknown. And now behold—anticipation and\\nuncertainty and remorse at the abandonment of the old life—all was\\nending, and the new was beginning. This new life could not but have\\nterrors for her inexperience; but, terrible or not, the change had been\\nwrought six weeks before in her soul, and this was merely the final\\nsanction of what had long been completed in her heart.\\n\\nTurning again to the lectern, the priest with some difficulty took\\nKitty’s little ring, and asking Levin for his hand, put it on the first\\njoint of his finger. “The servant of God, Konstantin, plights his troth\\nto the servant of God, Ekaterina.” And putting his big ring on Kitty’s\\ntouchingly weak, pink little finger, the priest said the same thing.\\n\\nAnd the bridal pair tried several times to understand what they had to\\ndo, and each time made some mistake and were corrected by the priest in\\na whisper. At last, having duly performed the ceremony, having signed\\nthe rings with the cross, the priest handed Kitty the big ring, and\\nLevin the little one. Again they were puzzled, and passed the rings\\nfrom hand to hand, still without doing what was expected.\\n\\nDolly, Tchirikov, and Stepan Arkadyevitch stepped forward to set them\\nright. There was an interval of hesitation, whispering, and smiles; but\\nthe expression of solemn emotion on the faces of the betrothed pair did\\nnot change: on the contrary, in their perplexity over their hands they\\nlooked more grave and deeply moved than before, and the smile with\\nwhich Stepan Arkadyevitch whispered to them that now they would each\\nput on their own ring died away on his lips. He had a feeling that any\\nsmile would jar on them.\\n\\n“Thou who didst from the beginning create male and female,” the priest\\nread after the exchange of rings, “from Thee woman was given to man to\\nbe a helpmeet to him, and for the procreation of children. O Lord, our\\nGod, who hast poured down the blessings of Thy Truth according to Thy\\nHoly Covenant upon Thy chosen servants, our fathers, from generation to\\ngeneration, bless Thy servants Konstantin and Ekaterina, and make their\\ntroth fast in faith, and union of hearts, and truth, and love....”\\n\\nLevin felt more and more that all his ideas of marriage, all his dreams\\nof how he would order his life, were mere childishness, and that it was\\nsomething he had not understood hitherto, and now understood less than\\never, though it was being performed upon him. The lump in his throat\\nrose higher and higher, tears that would not be checked came into his\\neyes 5\\n\\nIn the church there was all Moscow, all the friends and relations; and\\nduring the ceremony of plighting troth, in the brilliantly lighted\\nchurch, there was an incessant flow of discreetly subdued talk in the\\ncircle of gaily dressed women and girls, and men in white ties,\\nfrockcoats, and uniforms. The talk was principally kept up by the men,\\nwhile the women were absorbed in watching every detail of the ceremony,\\nwhich always means so much to them.\\n\\nIn the little group nearest to the bride were her two sisters: Dolly,\\nand the other one, the self-possessed beauty, Madame Lvova, who had\\njust arrived from abroad.\\n\\n“Why is it Marie’s in lilac, as bad as black, at a wedding?” said\\nMadame Korsunskaya.\\n\\n“With her complexion, it’s the one salvation,” responded Madame\\nTrubetskaya. “I wonder why they had the wedding in the evening? It’s\\nlike shop-people....”\\n\\n“So much prettier. I was married in the evening too....” answered\\nMadame Korsunskaya, and she sighed, remembering how charming she had\\nbeen that day, and how absurdly in love her husband was, and how\\ndifferent it all was now.\\n\\n“They say if anyone’s best man more than ten times, he’ll never be\\nmarried. I wanted to be for the tenth time, but the post was taken,”\\nsaid Count Siniavin to the pretty Princess Tcharskaya, who had designs\\non him.\\n\\nPrincess Tcharskaya only answered with a smile. She looked at Kitty,\\nthinking how and when she would stand with Count Siniavin in Kitty’s\\nplace, and how she would remind him then of his joke today.\\n\\nShtcherbatsky told the old maid of honor, Madame Nikolaeva, that he\\nmeant to put the crown on Kitty’s chignon for luck.\\n\\n“She ought not to have worn a chignon,” answered Madame Nikolaeva, who\\nhad long ago made up her mind that if the elderly widower she was\\nangling for married her, the wedding should be of the simplest. “I\\ndon’t like such grandeur.”\\n\\nSergey Ivanovitch was talking to Darya Dmitrievna, jestingly assuring\\nher that the custom of going away after the wedding was becoming common\\nbecause newly married people always felt a little ashamed of\\nthemselves.\\n\\n“Your brother may feel proud of himself. She’s a marvel of sweetness. I\\nbelieve you’re envious.”\\n\\n“Oh, I’ve got over that, Darya Dmitrievna,” he answered, and a\\nmelancholy and serious expression suddenly came over his face.\\n\\nStepan Arkadyevitch was telling his sister-in-law his joke about\\ndivorce.\\n\\n“The wreath wants setting straight,” she answered, not hearing him.\\n\\n“What a pity she’s lost her looks so,” Countess Nordston said to Madame\\nLvova. “Still he’s not worth her little finger, is he?”\\n\\n“Oh, I like him so—not because he’s my future _beau-frère_,” answered\\nMadame Lvova. “And how well he’s behaving! It’s so difficult, too, to\\nlook well in such a position, not to be ridiculous. And he’s not\\nridiculous, and not affected; one can see he’s moved.”\\n\\n“You expected it, I suppose?”\\n\\n“Almost. She always cared for him.”\\n\\n“Well, we shall see which of them will step on the rug first. I warned\\nKitty.”\\n\\n“It will make no difference,” said Madame Lvova; “we’re all obedient\\nwives; it’s in our family.”\\n\\n“Oh, I stepped on the rug before Vassily on purpose. And you, Dolly?”\\n\\nDolly stood beside them; she heard them, but she did not answer. She\\nwas deeply moved. The tears stood in her eyes, and she could not have\\nspoken without crying. She was rejoicing over Kitty and Levin; going\\nback in thought to her own wedding, she glanced at the radiant figure\\nof Stepan Arkadyevitch, forgot all the present, and remembered only her\\nown innocent love. She recalled not herself only, but all her\\nwomen-friends and acquaintances. She thought of them on the one day of\\ntheir triumph, when they had stood like Kitty under the wedding crown,\\nwith love and hope and dread in their hearts, renouncing the past, and\\nstepping forward into the mysterious future. Among the brides that came\\nback to her memory, she thought too of her darling Anna, of whose\\nproposed divorce she had just been hearing. And she had stood just as\\ninnocent in orange flowers and bridal veil. And now? “It’s terribly\\nstrange,” she said to herself. It was not merely the sisters, the\\nwomen-friends and female relations of the bride who were following\\nevery detail of the ceremony. Women who were quite strangers, mere\\nspectators, were watching it excitedly, holding their breath, in fear\\nof losing a single movement or expression of the bride and bridegroom,\\nand angrily not answering, often not hearing, the remarks of the\\ncallous men, who kept making joking or irrelevant observations.\\n\\n“Why has she been crying? Is she being married against her will?”\\n\\n“Against her will to a fine fellow like that? A prince, isn’t he?”\\n\\n“Is that her sister in the white satin? Just listen how the deacon\\nbooms out, ‘And fearing her husband.’”\\n\\n“Are the choristers from Tchudovo?”\\n\\n“No, from the Synod.”\\n\\n“I asked the footman. He says he’s going to take her home to his\\ncountry place at once. Awfully rich, they say. That’s why she’s being\\nmarried to him.”\\n\\n“No, they’re a well-matched pair.”\\n\\n“I say, Marya Vassilievna, you were making out those fly-away\\ncrinolines were not being worn. Just look at her in the puce dress—an\\nambassador’s wife they say she is—how her skirt bounces out from side\\nto side!”\\n\\n“What a pretty dear the bride is—like a lamb decked with flowers! Well,\\nsay what you will, we women feel for our sister.”\\n\\nSuch were the comments in the crowd of gazing women who had succeeded\\nin slipping in at the church doors 6\\n\\nWhen the ceremony of plighting troth was over, the beadle spread before\\nthe lectern in the middle of the church a piece of pink silken stuff,\\nthe choir sang a complicated and elaborate psalm, in which the bass and\\ntenor sang responses to one another, and the priest turning round\\npointed the bridal pair to the pink silk rug. Though both had often\\nheard a great deal about the saying that the one who steps first on the\\nrug will be the head of the house, neither Levin nor Kitty were capable\\nof recollecting it, as they took the few steps towards it. They did not\\nhear the loud remarks and disputes that followed, some maintaining he\\nhad stepped on first, and others that both had stepped on together.\\n\\nAfter the customary questions, whether they desired to enter upon\\nmatrimony, and whether they were pledged to anyone else, and their\\nanswers, which sounded strange to themselves, a new ceremony began.\\nKitty listened to the words of the prayer, trying to make out their\\nmeaning, but she could not. The feeling of triumph and radiant\\nhappiness flooded her soul more and more as the ceremony went on, and\\ndeprived her of all power of attention.\\n\\nThey prayed: “Endow them with continence and fruitfulness, and\\nvouchsafe that their hearts may rejoice looking upon their sons and\\ndaughters.” They alluded to God’s creation of a wife from Adam’s rib\\n“and for this cause a man shall leave father and mother, and cleave\\nunto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh,” and that “this is a\\ngreat mystery”; they prayed that God would make them fruitful and bless\\nthem, like Isaac and Rebecca, Joseph, Moses and Zipporah, and that they\\nmight look upon their children’s children. “That’s all splendid,”\\nthought Kitty, catching the words, “all that’s just as it should be,”\\nand a smile of happiness, unconsciously reflected in everyone who\\nlooked at her, beamed on her radiant face.\\n\\n“Put it on quite,” voices were heard urging when the priest had put on\\nthe wedding crowns and Shtcherbatsky, his hand shaking in its\\nthree-button glove, held the crown high above her head.\\n\\n“Put it on!” she whispered, smiling.\\n\\nLevin looked round at her, and was struck by the joyful radiance on her\\nface, and unconsciously her feeling infected him. He too, like her felt\\nglad and happy.\\n\\nThey enjoyed hearing the epistle read, and the roll of the head\\ndeacon’s voice at the last verse, awaited with such impatience by the\\noutside public. They enjoyed drinking out of the shallow cup of warm\\nred wine and water, and they were still more pleased when the priest,\\nflinging back his stole and taking both their hands in his, led them\\nround the lectern to the accompaniment of bass voices chanting “Glory\\nto God.”\\n\\nShtcherbatsky and Tchirikov, supporting the crowns and stumbling over\\nthe bride’s train, smiling too and seeming delighted at something, were\\nat one moment left behind, at the next treading on the bridal pair as\\nthe priest came to a halt. The spark of joy kindled in Kitty seemed to\\nhave infected everyone in the church. It seemed to Levin that the\\npriest and the deacon too wanted to smile just as he did.\\n\\nTaking the crowns off their heads the priest read the last prayer and\\ncongratulated the young people. Levin looked at Kitty, and he had never\\nbefore seen her look as she did. She was charming with the new radiance\\nof happiness in her face. Levin longed to say something to her, but he\\ndid not know whether it was all over. The priest got him out of his\\ndifficulty. He smiled his kindly smile and said gently, “Kiss your\\nwife, and you kiss your husband,” and took the candles out of their\\nhands.\\n\\nLevin kissed her smiling lips with timid care, gave her his arm, and\\nwith a new strange sense of closeness, walked out of the church. He did\\nnot believe, he could not believe, that it was true. It was only when\\ntheir wondering and timid eyes met that he believed in it, because he\\nfelt that they were one.\\n\\nAfter supper, the same night, the young people left for the country 7\\n\\nVronsky and Anna had been traveling for three months together in\\nEurope. They had visited Venice, Rome, and Naples, and had just arrived\\nat a small Italian town where they meant to stay some time. A handsome\\nhead waiter, with thick pomaded hair parted from the neck upwards, an\\nevening coat, a broad white cambric shirt front, and a bunch of\\ntrinkets hanging above his rounded stomach, stood with his hands in the\\nfull curve of his pockets, looking contemptuously from under his\\neyelids while he gave some frigid reply to a gentleman who had stopped\\nhim. Catching the sound of footsteps coming from the other side of the\\nentry towards the staircase, the head waiter turned round, and seeing\\nthe Russian count, who had taken their best rooms, he took his hands\\nout of his pockets deferentially, and with a bow informed him that a\\ncourier had been, and that the business about the palazzo had been\\narranged. The steward was prepared to sign the agreement.\\n\\n“Ah! I’m glad to hear it,” said Vronsky. “Is madame at home or not?”\\n\\n“Madame has been out for a walk but has returned now,” answered the\\nwaiter.\\n\\nVronsky took off his soft, wide-brimmed hat and passed his handkerchief\\nover his heated brow and hair, which had grown half over his ears, and\\nwas brushed back covering the bald patch on his head. And glancing\\ncasually at the gentleman, who still stood there gazing intently at\\nhim, he would have gone on.\\n\\n“This gentleman is a Russian, and was inquiring after you,” said the\\nhead waiter.\\n\\nWith mingled feelings of annoyance at never being able to get away from\\nacquaintances anywhere, and longing to find some sort of diversion from\\nthe monotony of his life, Vronsky looked once more at the gentleman,\\nwho had retreated and stood still again, and at the same moment a light\\ncame into the eyes of both.\\n\\n“Golenishtchev!”\\n\\n“Vronsky!”\\n\\nIt really was Golenishtchev, a comrade of Vronsky’s in the Corps of\\nPages. In the corps Golenishtchev had belonged to the liberal party; he\\nleft the corps without entering the army, and had never taken office\\nunder the government. Vronsky and he had gone completely different ways\\non leaving the corps, and had only met once since.\\n\\nAt that meeting Vronsky perceived that Golenishtchev had taken up a\\nsort of lofty, intellectually liberal line, and was consequently\\ndisposed to look down upon Vronsky’s interests and calling in life.\\nHence Vronsky had met him with the chilling and haughty manner he so\\nwell knew how to assume, the meaning of which was: “You may like or\\ndislike my way of life, that’s a matter of the most perfect\\nindifference to me; you will have to treat me with respect if you want\\nto know me.” Golenishtchev had been contemptuously indifferent to the\\ntone taken by Vronsky. This second meeting might have been expected,\\none would have supposed, to estrange them still more. But now they\\nbeamed and exclaimed with delight on recognizing one another. Vronsky\\nwould never have expected to be so pleased to see Golenishtchev, but\\nprobably he was not himself aware how bored he was. He forgot the\\ndisagreeable impression of their last meeting, and with a face of frank\\ndelight held out his hand to his old comrade. The same expression of\\ndelight replaced the look of uneasiness on Golenishtchev’s face.\\n\\n“How glad I am to meet you!” said Vronsky, showing his strong white\\nteeth in a friendly smile.\\n\\n“I heard the name Vronsky, but I didn’t know which one. I’m very, very\\nglad!”\\n\\n“Let’s go in. Come, tell me what you’re doing.”\\n\\n“I’ve been living here for two years. I’m working.”\\n\\n“Ah!” said Vronsky, with sympathy; “let’s go in.” And with the habit\\ncommon with Russians, instead of saying in Russian what he wanted to\\nkeep from the servants, he began to speak in French.\\n\\n“Do you know Madame Karenina? We are traveling together. I am going to\\nsee her now,” he said in French, carefully scrutinizing Golenishtchev’s\\nface.\\n\\n“Ah! I did not know” (though he did know), Golenishtchev answered\\ncarelessly. “Have you been here long?” he added.\\n\\n“Four days,” Vronsky answered, once more scrutinizing his friend’s face\\nintently.\\n\\n“Yes, he’s a decent fellow, and will look at the thing properly,”\\nVronsky said to himself, catching the significance of Golenishtchev’s\\nface and the change of subject. “I can introduce him to Anna, he looks\\nat it properly.”\\n\\nDuring those three months that Vronsky had spent abroad with Anna, he\\nhad always on meeting new people asked himself how the new person would\\nlook at his relations with Anna, and for the most part, in men, he had\\nmet with the “proper” way of looking at it. But if he had been asked,\\nand those who looked at it “properly” had been asked, exactly how they\\ndid look at it, both he and they would have been greatly puzzled to\\nanswer.\\n\\nIn reality, those who in Vronsky’s opinion had the “proper” view had no\\nsort of view at all, but behaved in general as well-bred persons do\\nbehave in regard to all the complex and insoluble problems with which\\nlife is encompassed on all sides; they behaved with propriety, avoiding\\nallusions and unpleasant questions. They assumed an air of fully\\ncomprehending the import and force of the situation, of accepting and\\neven approving of it, but of considering it superfluous and uncalled\\nfor to put all this into words.\\n\\nVronsky at once divined that Golenishtchev was of this class, and\\ntherefore was doubly pleased to see him. And in fact, Golenishtchev’s\\nmanner to Madame Karenina, when he was taken to call on her, was all\\nthat Vronsky could have desired. Obviously without the slightest effort\\nhe steered clear of all subjects which might lead to embarrassment.\\n\\nHe had never met Anna before, and was struck by her beauty, and still\\nmore by the frankness with which she accepted her position. She blushed\\nwhen Vronsky brought in Golenishtchev, and he was extremely charmed by\\nthis childish blush overspreading her candid and handsome face. But\\nwhat he liked particularly was the way in which at once, as though on\\npurpose that there might be no misunderstanding with an outsider, she\\ncalled Vronsky simply Alexey, and said they were moving into a house\\nthey had just taken, what was here called a palazzo. Golenishtchev\\nliked this direct and simple attitude to her own position. Looking at\\nAnna’s manner of simple-hearted, spirited gaiety, and knowing Alexey\\nAlexandrovitch and Vronsky, Golenishtchev fancied that he understood\\nher perfectly. He fancied that he understood what she was utterly\\nunable to understand: how it was that, having made her husband\\nwretched, having abandoned him and her son and lost her good name, she\\nyet felt full of spirits, gaiety, and happiness.\\n\\n“It’s in the guide-book,” said Golenishtchev, referring to the palazzo\\nVronsky had taken. “There’s a first-rate Tintoretto there. One of his\\nlatest period.”\\n\\n“I tell you what: it’s a lovely day, let’s go and have another look at\\nit,” said Vronsky, addressing Anna.\\n\\n“I shall be very glad to; I’ll go and put on my hat. Would you say it’s\\nhot?” she said, stopping short in the doorway and looking inquiringly\\nat Vronsky. And again a vivid flush overspread her face.\\n\\nVronsky saw from her eyes that she did not know on what terms he cared\\nto be with Golenishtchev, and so was afraid of not behaving as he would\\nwish.\\n\\nHe looked a long, tender look at her.\\n\\n“No, not very,” he said.\\n\\nAnd it seemed to her that she understood everything, most of all, that\\nhe was pleased with her; and smiling to him, she walked with her rapid\\nstep out at the door.\\n\\nThe friends glanced at one another, and a look of hesitation came into\\nboth faces, as though Golenishtchev, unmistakably admiring her, would\\nhave liked to say something about her, and could not find the right\\nthing to say, while Vronsky desired and dreaded his doing so.\\n\\n“Well then,” Vronsky began to start a conversation of some sort; “so\\nyou’re settled here? You’re still at the same work, then?” he went on,\\nrecalling that he had been told Golenishtchev was writing something.\\n\\n“Yes, I’m writing the second part of the _Two Elements_,” said\\nGolenishtchev, coloring with pleasure at the question—“that is, to be\\nexact, I am not writing it yet; I am preparing, collecting materials.\\nIt will be of far wider scope, and will touch on almost all questions.\\nWe in Russia refuse to see that we are the heirs of Byzantium,” and he\\nlaunched into a long and heated explanation of his views.\\n\\nVronsky at the first moment felt embarrassed at not even knowing of the\\nfirst part of the _Two Elements_, of which the author spoke as\\nsomething well known. But as Golenishtchev began to lay down his\\nopinions and Vronsky was able to follow them even without knowing the\\n_Two Elements_, he listened to him with some interest, for\\nGolenishtchev spoke well. But Vronsky was startled and annoyed by the\\nnervous irascibility with which Golenishtchev talked of the subject\\nthat engrossed him. As he went on talking, his eyes glittered more and\\nmore angrily; he was more and more hurried in his replies to imaginary\\nopponents, and his face grew more and more excited and worried.\\nRemembering Golenishtchev, a thin, lively, good-natured and well-bred\\nboy, always at the head of the class, Vronsky could not make out the\\nreason of his irritability, and he did not like it. What he\\nparticularly disliked was that Golenishtchev, a man belonging to a good\\nset, should put himself on a level with some scribbling fellows, with\\nwhom he was irritated and angry. Was it worth it? Vronsky disliked it,\\nyet he felt that Golenishtchev was unhappy, and was sorry for him.\\nUnhappiness, almost mental derangement, was visible on his mobile,\\nrather handsome face, while without even noticing Anna’s coming in, he\\nwent on hurriedly and hotly expressing his views.\\n\\nWhen Anna came in in her hat and cape, and her lovely hand rapidly\\nswinging her parasol, and stood beside him, it was with a feeling of\\nrelief that Vronsky broke away from the plaintive eyes of Golenishtchev\\nwhich fastened persistently upon him, and with a fresh rush of love\\nlooked at his charming companion, full of life and happiness.\\nGolenishtchev recovered himself with an effort, and at first was\\ndejected and gloomy, but Anna, disposed to feel friendly with everyone\\nas she was at that time, soon revived his spirits by her direct and\\nlively manner. After trying various subjects of conversation, she got\\nhim upon painting, of which he talked very well, and she listened to\\nhim attentively. They walked to the house they had taken, and looked\\nover it.\\n\\n“I am very glad of one thing,” said Anna to Golenishtchev when they\\nwere on their way back, “Alexey will have a capital _atelier_. You must\\ncertainly take that room,” she said to Vronsky in Russian, using the\\naffectionately familiar form as though she saw that Golenishtchev would\\nbecome intimate with them in their isolation, and that there was no\\nneed of reserve before him.\\n\\n“Do you paint?” said Golenishtchev, turning round quickly to Vronsky.\\n\\n“Yes, I used to study long ago, and now I have begun to do a little,”\\nsaid Vronsky, reddening.\\n\\n“He has great talent,” said Anna with a delighted smile. “I’m no judge,\\nof course. But good judges have said the same 8\\n\\nAnna, in that first period of her emancipation and rapid return to\\nhealth, felt herself unpardonably happy and full of the joy of life.\\nThe thought of her husband’s unhappiness did not poison her happiness.\\nOn one side that memory was too awful to be thought of. On the other\\nside her husband’s unhappiness had given her too much happiness to be\\nregretted. The memory of all that had happened after her illness: her\\nreconciliation with her husband, its breakdown, the news of Vronsky’s\\nwound, his visit, the preparations for divorce, the departure from her\\nhusband’s house, the parting from her son—all that seemed to her like a\\ndelirious dream, from which she had waked up alone with Vronsky abroad.\\nThe thought of the harm caused to her husband aroused in her a feeling\\nlike repulsion, and akin to what a drowning man might feel who has\\nshaken off another man clinging to him. That man did drown. It was an\\nevil action, of course, but it was the sole means of escape, and better\\nnot to brood over these fearful facts.\\n\\nOne consolatory reflection upon her conduct had occurred to her at the\\nfirst moment of the final rupture, and when now she recalled all the\\npast, she remembered that one reflection. “I have inevitably made that\\nman wretched,” she thought; “but I don’t want to profit by his misery.\\nI too am suffering, and shall suffer; I am losing what I prized above\\neverything—I am losing my good name and my son. I have done wrong, and\\nso I don’t want happiness, I don’t want a divorce, and shall suffer\\nfrom my shame and the separation from my child.” But, however sincerely\\nAnna had meant to suffer, she was not suffering. Shame there was not.\\nWith the tact of which both had such a large share, they had succeeded\\nin avoiding Russian ladies abroad, and so had never placed themselves\\nin a false position, and everywhere they had met people who pretended\\nthat they perfectly understood their position, far better indeed than\\nthey did themselves. Separation from the son she loved—even that did\\nnot cause her anguish in these early days. The baby girl—_his_\\nchild—was so sweet, and had so won Anna’s heart, since she was all that\\nwas left her, that Anna rarely thought of her son.\\n\\nThe desire for life, waxing stronger with recovered health, was so\\nintense, and the conditions of life were so new and pleasant, that Anna\\nfelt unpardonably happy. The more she got to know Vronsky, the more she\\nloved him. She loved him for himself, and for his love for her. Her\\ncomplete ownership of him was a continual joy to her. His presence was\\nalways sweet to her. All the traits of his character, which she learned\\nto know better and better, were unutterably dear to her. His\\nappearance, changed by his civilian dress, was as fascinating to her as\\nthough she were some young girl in love. In everything he said,\\nthought, and did, she saw something particularly noble and elevated.\\nHer adoration of him alarmed her indeed; she sought and could not find\\nin him anything not fine. She dared not show him her sense of her own\\ninsignificance beside him. It seemed to her that, knowing this, he\\nmight sooner cease to love her; and she dreaded nothing now so much as\\nlosing his love, though she had no grounds for fearing it. But she\\ncould not help being grateful to him for his attitude to her, and\\nshowing that she appreciated it. He, who had in her opinion such a\\nmarked aptitude for a political career, in which he would have been\\ncertain to play a leading part—he had sacrificed his ambition for her\\nsake, and never betrayed the slightest regret. He was more lovingly\\nrespectful to her than ever, and the constant care that she should not\\nfeel the awkwardness of her position never deserted him for a single\\ninstant. He, so manly a man, never opposed her, had indeed, with her,\\nno will of his own, and was anxious, it seemed, for nothing but to\\nanticipate her wishes. And she could not but appreciate this, even\\nthough the very intensity of his solicitude for her, the atmosphere of\\ncare with which he surrounded her, sometimes weighed upon her.\\n\\nVronsky, meanwhile, in spite of the complete realization of what he had\\nso long desired, was not perfectly happy. He soon felt that the\\nrealization of his desires gave him no more than a grain of sand out of\\nthe mountain of happiness he had expected. It showed him the mistake\\nmen make in picturing to themselves happiness as the realization of\\ntheir desires. For a time after joining his life to hers, and putting\\non civilian dress, he had felt all the delight of freedom in general of\\nwhich he had known nothing before, and of freedom in his love,—and he\\nwas content, but not for long. He was soon aware that there was\\nspringing up in his heart a desire for desires—_ennui_. Without\\nconscious intention he began to clutch at every passing caprice, taking\\nit for a desire and an object. Sixteen hours of the day must be\\noccupied in some way, since they were living abroad in complete\\nfreedom, outside the conditions of social life which filled up time in\\nPetersburg. As for the amusements of bachelor existence, which had\\nprovided Vronsky with entertainment on previous tours abroad, they\\ncould not be thought of, since the sole attempt of the sort had led to\\na sudden attack of depression in Anna, quite out of proportion with the\\ncause—a late supper with bachelor friends. Relations with the society\\nof the place—foreign and Russian—were equally out of the question owing\\nto the irregularity of their position. The inspection of objects of\\ninterest, apart from the fact that everything had been seen already,\\nhad not for Vronsky, a Russian and a sensible man, the immense\\nsignificance Englishmen are able to attach to that pursuit.\\n\\nAnd just as the hungry stomach eagerly accepts every object it can get,\\nhoping to find nourishment in it, Vronsky quite unconsciously clutched\\nfirst at politics, then at new books, and then at pictures.\\n\\nAs he had from a child a taste for painting, and as, not knowing what\\nto spend his money on, he had begun collecting engravings, he came to a\\nstop at painting, began to take interest in it, and concentrated upon\\nit the unoccupied mass of desires which demanded satisfaction.\\n\\nHe had a ready appreciation of art, and probably, with a taste for\\nimitating art, he supposed himself to have the real thing essential for\\nan artist, and after hesitating for some time which style of painting\\nto select—religious, historical, realistic, or genre painting—he set to\\nwork to paint. He appreciated all kinds, and could have felt inspired\\nby anyone of them; but he had no conception of the possibility of\\nknowing nothing at all of any school of painting, and of being inspired\\ndirectly by what is within the soul, without caring whether what is\\npainted will belong to any recognized school. Since he knew nothing of\\nthis, and drew his inspiration, not directly from life, but indirectly\\nfrom life embodied in art, his inspiration came very quickly and\\neasily, and as quickly and easily came his success in painting\\nsomething very similar to the sort of painting he was trying to\\nimitate.\\n\\nMore than any other style he liked the French—graceful and\\neffective—and in that style he began to paint Anna’s portrait in\\nItalian costume, and the portrait seemed to him, and to everyone who\\nsaw it, extremely successful 9\\n\\nThe old neglected palazzo, with its lofty carved ceilings and frescoes\\non the walls, with its floors of mosaic, with its heavy yellow stuff\\ncurtains on the windows, with its vases on pedestals, and its open\\nfireplaces, its carved doors and gloomy reception rooms, hung with\\npictures—this palazzo did much, by its very appearance after they had\\nmoved into it, to confirm in Vronsky the agreeable illusion that he was\\nnot so much a Russian country gentleman, a retired army officer, as an\\nenlightened amateur and patron of the arts, himself a modest artist who\\nhad renounced the world, his connections, and his ambition for the sake\\nof the woman he loved.\\n\\nThe pose chosen by Vronsky with their removal into the palazzo was\\ncompletely successful, and having, through Golenishtchev, made\\nacquaintance with a few interesting people, for a time he was\\nsatisfied. He painted studies from nature under the guidance of an\\nItalian professor of painting, and studied mediæval Italian life.\\nMediæval Italian life so fascinated Vronsky that he even wore a hat and\\nflung a cloak over his shoulder in the mediæval style, which, indeed,\\nwas extremely becoming to him.\\n\\n“Here we live, and know nothing of what’s going on,” Vronsky said to\\nGolenishtchev as he came to see him one morning. “Have you seen\\nMihailov’s picture?” he said, handing him a Russian gazette he had\\nreceived that morning, and pointing to an article on a Russian artist,\\nliving in the very same town, and just finishing a picture which had\\nlong been talked about, and had been bought beforehand. The article\\nreproached the government and the academy for letting so remarkable an\\nartist be left without encouragement and support.\\n\\n“I’ve seen it,” answered Golenishtchev. “Of course, he’s not without\\ntalent, but it’s all in a wrong direction. It’s all the\\nIvanov-Strauss-Renan attitude to Christ and to religious painting.”\\n\\n“What is the subject of the picture?” asked Anna.\\n\\n“Christ before Pilate. Christ is represented as a Jew with all the\\nrealism of the new school.”\\n\\nAnd the question of the subject of the picture having brought him to\\none of his favorite theories, Golenishtchev launched forth into a\\ndisquisition on it.\\n\\n“I can’t understand how they can fall into such a gross mistake. Christ\\nalways has His definite embodiment in the art of the great masters. And\\ntherefore, if they want to depict, not God, but a revolutionist or a\\nsage, let them take from history a Socrates, a Franklin, a Charlotte\\nCorday, but not Christ. They take the very figure which cannot be taken\\nfor their art, and then....”\\n\\n“And is it true that this Mihailov is in such poverty?” asked Vronsky,\\nthinking that, as a Russian Mæcenas, it was his duty to assist the\\nartist regardless of whether the picture were good or bad.\\n\\n“I should say not. He’s a remarkable portrait-painter. Have you ever\\nseen his portrait of Madame Vassiltchikova? But I believe he doesn’t\\ncare about painting any more portraits, and so very likely he is in\\nwant. I maintain that....”\\n\\n“Couldn’t we ask him to paint a portrait of Anna Arkadyevna?” said\\nVronsky.\\n\\n“Why mine?” said Anna. “After yours I don’t want another portrait.\\nBetter have one of Annie” (so she called her baby girl). “Here she is,”\\nshe added, looking out of the window at the handsome Italian nurse, who\\nwas carrying the child out into the garden, and immediately glancing\\nunnoticed at Vronsky. The handsome nurse, from whom Vronsky was\\npainting a head for his picture, was the one hidden grief in Anna’s\\nlife. He painted with her as his model, admired her beauty and\\nmediævalism, and Anna dared not confess to herself that she was afraid\\nof becoming jealous of this nurse, and was for that reason particularly\\ngracious and condescending both to her and her little son. Vronsky,\\ntoo, glanced out of the window and into Anna’s eyes, and, turning at\\nonce to Golenishtchev, he said:\\n\\n“Do you know this Mihailov?”\\n\\n“I have met him. But he’s a queer fish, and quite without breeding. You\\nknow, one of those uncouth new people one’s so often coming across\\nnowadays, one of those free-thinkers you know, who are reared\\n_d’emblée_ in theories of atheism, scepticism, and materialism. In\\nformer days,” said Golenishtchev, not observing, or not willing to\\nobserve, that both Anna and Vronsky wanted to speak, “in former days\\nthe free-thinker was a man who had been brought up in ideas of\\nreligion, law, and morality, and only through conflict and struggle\\ncame to free-thought; but now there has sprung up a new type of born\\nfree-thinkers who grow up without even having heard of principles of\\nmorality or of religion, of the existence of authorities, who grow up\\ndirectly in ideas of negation in everything, that is to say, savages.\\nWell, he’s of that class. He’s the son, it appears, of some Moscow\\nbutler, and has never had any sort of bringing-up. When he got into the\\nacademy and made his reputation he tried, as he’s no fool, to educate\\nhimself. And he turned to what seemed to him the very source of\\nculture—the magazines. In old times, you see, a man who wanted to\\neducate himself—a Frenchman, for instance—would have set to work to\\nstudy all the classics and theologians and tragedians and historians\\nand philosophers, and, you know, all the intellectual work that came in\\nhis way. But in our day he goes straight for the literature of\\nnegation, very quickly assimilates all the extracts of the science of\\nnegation, and he’s ready. And that’s not all—twenty years ago he would\\nhave found in that literature traces of conflict with authorities, with\\nthe creeds of the ages; he would have perceived from this conflict that\\nthere was something else; but now he comes at once upon a literature in\\nwhich the old creeds do not even furnish matter for discussion, but it\\nis stated baldly that there is nothing else—evolution, natural\\nselection, struggle for existence—and that’s all. In my article\\nI’ve....”\\n\\n“I tell you what,” said Anna, who had for a long while been exchanging\\nwary glances with Vronsky, and knew that he was not in the least\\ninterested in the education of this artist, but was simply absorbed by\\nthe idea of assisting him, and ordering a portrait of him; “I tell you\\nwhat,” she said, resolutely interrupting Golenishtchev, who was still\\ntalking away, “let’s go and see him!”\\n\\nGolenishtchev recovered his self-possession and readily agreed. But as\\nthe artist lived in a remote suburb, it was decided to take the\\ncarriage.\\n\\nAn hour later Anna, with Golenishtchev by her side and Vronsky on the\\nfront seat of the carriage, facing them, drove up to a new ugly house\\nin the remote suburb. On learning from the porter’s wife, who came out\\nto them, that Mihailov saw visitors at his studio, but that at that\\nmoment he was in his lodging only a couple of steps off, they sent her\\nto him with their cards, asking permission to see his picture 10\\n\\nThe artist Mihailov was, as always, at work when the cards of Count\\nVronsky and Golenishtchev were brought to him. In the morning he had\\nbeen working in his studio at his big picture. On getting home he flew\\ninto a rage with his wife for not having managed to put off the\\nlandlady, who had been asking for money.\\n\\n“I’ve said it to you twenty times, don’t enter into details. You’re\\nfool enough at all times, and when you start explaining things in\\nItalian you’re a fool three times as foolish,” he said after a long\\ndispute.\\n\\n“Don’t let it run so long; it’s not my fault. If I had the money....”\\n\\n“Leave me in peace, for God’s sake!” Mihailov shrieked, with tears in\\nhis voice, and, stopping his ears, he went off into his working room,\\nthe other side of a partition wall, and closed the door after him.\\n“Idiotic woman!” he said to himself, sat down to the table, and,\\nopening a portfolio, he set to work at once with peculiar fervor at a\\nsketch he had begun.\\n\\nNever did he work with such fervor and success as when things went ill\\nwith him, and especially when he quarreled with his wife. “Oh! damn\\nthem all!” he thought as he went on working. He was making a sketch for\\nthe figure of a man in a violent rage. A sketch had been made before,\\nbut he was dissatisfied with it. “No, that one was better ... where is\\nit?” He went back to his wife, and scowling, and not looking at her,\\nasked his eldest little girl, where was that piece of paper he had\\ngiven them? The paper with the discarded sketch on it was found, but it\\nwas dirty, and spotted with candle-grease. Still, he took the sketch,\\nlaid it on his table, and, moving a little away, screwing up his eyes,\\nhe fell to gazing at it. All at once he smiled and gesticulated\\ngleefully.\\n\\n“That’s it! that’s it!” he said, and, at once picking up the pencil, he\\nbegan rapidly drawing. The spot of tallow had given the man a new pose.\\n\\nHe had sketched this new pose, when all at once he recalled the face of\\na shopkeeper of whom he had bought cigars, a vigorous face with a\\nprominent chin, and he sketched this very face, this chin on to the\\nfigure of the man. He laughed aloud with delight. The figure from a\\nlifeless imagined thing had become living, and such that it could never\\nbe changed. That figure lived, and was clearly and unmistakably\\ndefined. The sketch might be corrected in accordance with the\\nrequirements of the figure, the legs, indeed, could and must be put\\ndifferently, and the position of the left hand must be quite altered;\\nthe hair too might be thrown back. But in making these corrections he\\nwas not altering the figure but simply getting rid of what concealed\\nthe figure. He was, as it were, stripping off the wrappings which\\nhindered it from being distinctly seen. Each new feature only brought\\nout the whole figure in all its force and vigor, as it had suddenly\\ncome to him from the spot of tallow. He was carefully finishing the\\nfigure when the cards were brought him.\\n\\n“Coming, coming!”\\n\\nHe went in to his wife.\\n\\n“Come, Sasha, don’t be cross!” he said, smiling timidly and\\naffectionately at her. “You were to blame. I was to blame. I’ll make it\\nall right.” And having made peace with his wife he put on an\\nolive-green overcoat with a velvet collar and a hat, and went towards\\nhis studio. The successful figure he had already forgotten. Now he was\\ndelighted and excited at the visit of these people of consequence,\\nRussians, who had come in their carriage.\\n\\nOf his picture, the one that stood now on his easel, he had at the\\nbottom of his heart one conviction—that no one had ever painted a\\npicture like it. He did not believe that his picture was better than\\nall the pictures of Raphael, but he knew that what he tried to convey\\nin that picture, no one ever had conveyed. This he knew positively, and\\nhad known a long while, ever since he had begun to paint it. But other\\npeople’s criticisms, whatever they might be, had yet immense\\nconsequence in his eyes, and they agitated him to the depths of his\\nsoul. Any remark, the most insignificant, that showed that the critic\\nsaw even the tiniest part of what he saw in the picture, agitated him\\nto the depths of his soul. He always attributed to his critics a more\\nprofound comprehension than he had himself, and always expected from\\nthem something he did not himself see in the picture. And often in\\ntheir criticisms he fancied that he had found this.\\n\\nHe walked rapidly to the door of his studio, and in spite of his\\nexcitement he was struck by the soft light on Anna’s figure as she\\nstood in the shade of the entrance listening to Golenishtchev, who was\\neagerly telling her something, while she evidently wanted to look round\\nat the artist. He was himself unconscious how, as he approached them,\\nhe seized on this impression and absorbed it, as he had the chin of the\\nshopkeeper who had sold him the cigars, and put it away somewhere to be\\nbrought out when he wanted it. The visitors, not agreeably impressed\\nbeforehand by Golenishtchev’s account of the artist, were still less so\\nby his personal appearance. Thick-set and of middle height, with nimble\\nmovements, with his brown hat, olive-green coat and narrow\\ntrousers—though wide trousers had been a long while in fashion,—most of\\nall, with the ordinariness of his broad face, and the combined\\nexpression of timidity and anxiety to keep up his dignity, Mihailov\\nmade an unpleasant impression.\\n\\n“Please step in,” he said, trying to look indifferent, and going into\\nthe passage he took a key out of his pocket and opened the door 11\\n\\nOn entering the studio, Mihailov once more scanned his visitors and\\nnoted down in his imagination Vronsky’s expression too, and especially\\nhis jaws. Although his artistic sense was unceasingly at work\\ncollecting materials, although he felt a continually increasing\\nexcitement as the moment of criticizing his work drew nearer, he\\nrapidly and subtly formed, from imperceptible signs, a mental image of\\nthese three persons.\\n\\nThat fellow (Golenishtchev) was a Russian living here. Mihailov did not\\nremember his surname nor where he had met him, nor what he had said to\\nhim. He only remembered his face as he remembered all the faces he had\\never seen; but he remembered, too, that it was one of the faces laid by\\nin his memory in the immense class of the falsely consequential and\\npoor in expression. The abundant hair and very open forehead gave an\\nappearance of consequence to the face, which had only one expression—a\\npetty, childish, peevish expression, concentrated just above the bridge\\nof the narrow nose. Vronsky and Madame Karenina must be, Mihailov\\nsupposed, distinguished and wealthy Russians, knowing nothing about\\nart, like all those wealthy Russians, but posing as amateurs and\\nconnoisseurs. “Most likely they’ve already looked at all the antiques,\\nand now they’re making the round of the studios of the new people, the\\nGerman humbug, and the cracked Pre-Raphaelite English fellow, and have\\nonly come to me to make the point of view complete,” he thought. He was\\nwell acquainted with the way dilettanti have (the cleverer they were\\nthe worse he found them) of looking at the works of contemporary\\nartists with the sole object of being in a position to say that art is\\na thing of the past, and that the more one sees of the new men the more\\none sees how inimitable the works of the great old masters have\\nremained. He expected all this; he saw it all in their faces, he saw it\\nin the careless indifference with which they talked among themselves,\\nstared at the lay figures and busts, and walked about in leisurely\\nfashion, waiting for him to uncover his picture. But in spite of this,\\nwhile he was turning over his studies, pulling up the blinds and taking\\noff the sheet, he was in intense excitement, especially as, in spite of\\nhis conviction that all distinguished and wealthy Russians were certain\\nto be beasts and fools, he liked Vronsky, and still more Anna.\\n\\n“Here, if you please,” he said, moving on one side with his nimble gait\\nand pointing to his picture, “it’s the exhortation to Pilate. Matthew,\\nchapter xxvii,” he said, feeling his lips were beginning to tremble\\nwith emotion. He moved away and stood behind them.\\n\\nFor the few seconds during which the visitors were gazing at the\\npicture in silence Mihailov too gazed at it with the indifferent eye of\\nan outsider. For those few seconds he was sure in anticipation that a\\nhigher, juster criticism would be uttered by them, by those very\\nvisitors whom he had been so despising a moment before. He forgot all\\nhe had thought about his picture before during the three years he had\\nbeen painting it; he forgot all its qualities which had been absolutely\\ncertain to him—he saw the picture with their indifferent, new, outside\\neyes, and saw nothing good in it. He saw in the foreground Pilate’s\\nirritated face and the serene face of Christ, and in the background the\\nfigures of Pilate’s retinue and the face of John watching what was\\nhappening. Every face that, with such agony, such blunders and\\ncorrections had grown up within him with its special character, every\\nface that had given him such torments and such raptures, and all these\\nfaces so many times transposed for the sake of the harmony of the\\nwhole, all the shades of color and tones that he had attained with such\\nlabor—all of this together seemed to him now, looking at it with their\\neyes, the merest vulgarity, something that had been done a thousand\\ntimes over. The face dearest to him, the face of Christ, the center of\\nthe picture, which had given him such ecstasy as it unfolded itself to\\nhim, was utterly lost to him when he glanced at the picture with their\\neyes. He saw a well-painted (no, not even that—he distinctly saw now a\\nmass of defects) repetition of those endless Christs of Titian,\\nRaphael, Rubens, and the same soldiers and Pilate. It was all common,\\npoor, and stale, and positively badly painted—weak and unequal. They\\nwould be justified in repeating hypocritically civil speeches in the\\npresence of the painter, and pitying him and laughing at him when they\\nwere alone again.\\n\\nThe silence (though it lasted no more than a minute) became too\\nintolerable to him. To break it, and to show he was not agitated, he\\nmade an effort and addressed Golenishtchev.\\n\\n“I think I’ve had the pleasure of meeting you,” he said, looking\\nuneasily first at Anna, then at Vronsky, in fear of losing any shade of\\ntheir expression.\\n\\n“To be sure! We met at Rossi’s, do you remember, at that _soirée_ when\\nthat Italian lady recited—the new Rachel?” Golenishtchev answered\\neasily, removing his eyes without the slightest regret from the picture\\nand turning to the artist.\\n\\nNoticing, however, that Mihailov was expecting a criticism of the\\npicture, he said:\\n\\n“Your picture has got on a great deal since I saw it last time; and\\nwhat strikes me particularly now, as it did then, is the figure of\\nPilate. One so knows the man: a good-natured, capital fellow, but an\\nofficial through and through, who does not know what it is he’s doing.\\nBut I fancy....”\\n\\nAll Mihailov’s mobile face beamed at once; his eyes sparkled. He tried\\nto say something, but he could not speak for excitement, and pretended\\nto be coughing. Low as was his opinion of Golenishtchev’s capacity for\\nunderstanding art, trifling as was the true remark upon the fidelity of\\nthe expression of Pilate as an official, and offensive as might have\\nseemed the utterance of so unimportant an observation while nothing was\\nsaid of more serious points, Mihailov was in an ecstasy of delight at\\nthis observation. He had himself thought about Pilate’s figure just\\nwhat Golenishtchev said. The fact that this reflection was but one of\\nmillions of reflections, which as Mihailov knew for certain would be\\ntrue, did not diminish for him the significance of Golenishtchev’s\\nremark. His heart warmed to Golenishtchev for this remark, and from a\\nstate of depression he suddenly passed to ecstasy. At once the whole of\\nhis picture lived before him in all the indescribable complexity of\\neverything living. Mihailov again tried to say that that was how he\\nunderstood Pilate, but his lips quivered intractably, and he could not\\npronounce the words. Vronsky and Anna too said something in that\\nsubdued voice in which, partly to avoid hurting the artist’s feelings\\nand partly to avoid saying out loud something silly—so easily said when\\ntalking of art—people usually speak at exhibitions of pictures.\\nMihailov fancied that the picture had made an impression on them too.\\nHe went up to them.\\n\\n“How marvelous Christ’s expression is!” said Anna. Of all she saw she\\nliked that expression most of all, and she felt that it was the center\\nof the picture, and so praise of it would be pleasant to the artist.\\n“One can see that He is pitying Pilate.”\\n\\nThis again was one of the million true reflections that could be found\\nin his picture and in the figure of Christ. She said that He was\\npitying Pilate. In Christ’s expression there ought to be indeed an\\nexpression of pity, since there is an expression of love, of heavenly\\npeace, of readiness for death, and a sense of the vanity of words. Of\\ncourse there is the expression of an official in Pilate and of pity in\\nChrist, seeing that one is the incarnation of the fleshly and the other\\nof the spiritual life. All this and much more flashed into Mihailov’s\\nthoughts.\\n\\n“Yes, and how that figure is done—what atmosphere! One can walk round\\nit,” said Golenishtchev, unmistakably betraying by this remark that he\\ndid not approve of the meaning and idea of the figure.\\n\\n“Yes, there’s a wonderful mastery!” said Vronsky. “How those figures in\\nthe background stand out! There you have technique,” he said,\\naddressing Golenishtchev, alluding to a conversation between them about\\nVronsky’s despair of attaining this technique.\\n\\n“Yes, yes, marvelous!” Golenishtchev and Anna assented. In spite of the\\nexcited condition in which he was, the sentence about technique had\\nsent a pang to Mihailov’s heart, and looking angrily at Vronsky he\\nsuddenly scowled. He had often heard this word technique, and was\\nutterly unable to understand what was understood by it. He knew that by\\nthis term was understood a mechanical facility for painting or drawing,\\nentirely apart from its subject. He had noticed often that even in\\nactual praise technique was opposed to essential quality, as though one\\ncould paint well something that was bad. He knew that a great deal of\\nattention and care was necessary in taking off the coverings, to avoid\\ninjuring the creation itself, and to take off all the coverings; but\\nthere was no art of painting—no technique of any sort—about it. If to a\\nlittle child or to his cook were revealed what he saw, it or she would\\nhave been able to peel the wrappings off what was seen. And the most\\nexperienced and adroit painter could not by mere mechanical facility\\npaint anything if the lines of the subject were not revealed to him\\nfirst. Besides, he saw that if it came to talking about technique, it\\nwas impossible to praise him for it. In all he had painted and\\nrepainted he saw faults that hurt his eyes, coming from want of care in\\ntaking off the wrappings—faults he could not correct now without\\nspoiling the whole. And in almost all the figures and faces he saw,\\ntoo, remnants of the wrappings not perfectly removed that spoiled the\\npicture.\\n\\n“One thing might be said, if you will allow me to make the remark....”\\nobserved Golenishtchev.\\n\\n“Oh, I shall be delighted, I beg you,” said Mihailov with a forced\\nsmile.\\n\\n“That is, that you make Him the man-god, and not the God-man. But I\\nknow that was what you meant to do.”\\n\\n“I cannot paint a Christ that is not in my heart,” said Mihailov\\ngloomily.\\n\\n“Yes; but in that case, if you will allow me to say what I think....\\nYour picture is so fine that my observation cannot detract from it,\\nand, besides, it is only my personal opinion. With you it is different.\\nYour very motive is different. But let us take Ivanov. I imagine that\\nif Christ is brought down to the level of an historical character, it\\nwould have been better for Ivanov to select some other historical\\nsubject, fresh, untouched.”\\n\\n“But if this is the greatest subject presented to art?”\\n\\n“If one looked one would find others. But the point is that art cannot\\nsuffer doubt and discussion. And before the picture of Ivanov the\\nquestion arises for the believer and the unbeliever alike, ‘Is it God,\\nor is it not God?’ and the unity of the impression is destroyed.”\\n\\n“Why so? I think that for educated people,” said Mihailov, “the\\nquestion cannot exist.”\\n\\nGolenishtchev did not agree with this, and confounded Mihailov by his\\nsupport of his first idea of the unity of the impression being\\nessential to art.\\n\\nMihailov was greatly perturbed, but he could say nothing in defense of\\nhis own idea 12\\n\\nAnna and Vronsky had long been exchanging glances, regretting their\\nfriend’s flow of cleverness. At last Vronsky, without waiting for the\\nartist, walked away to another small picture.\\n\\n“Oh, how exquisite! What a lovely thing! A gem! How exquisite!” they\\ncried with one voice.\\n\\n“What is it they’re so pleased with?” thought Mihailov. He had\\npositively forgotten that picture he had painted three years ago. He\\nhad forgotten all the agonies and the ecstasies he had lived through\\nwith that picture when for several months it had been the one thought\\nhaunting him day and night. He had forgotten, as he always forgot, the\\npictures he had finished. He did not even like to look at it, and had\\nonly brought it out because he was expecting an Englishman who wanted\\nto buy it.\\n\\n“Oh, that’s only an old study,” he said.\\n\\n“How fine!” said Golenishtchev, he too, with unmistakable sincerity,\\nfalling under the spell of the picture.\\n\\nTwo boys were angling in the shade of a willow-tree. The elder had just\\ndropped in the hook, and was carefully pulling the float from behind a\\nbush, entirely absorbed in what he was doing. The other, a little\\nyounger, was lying in the grass leaning on his elbows, with his\\ntangled, flaxen head in his hands, staring at the water with his dreamy\\nblue eyes. What was he thinking of?\\n\\nThe enthusiasm over this picture stirred some of the old feeling for it\\nin Mihailov, but he feared and disliked this waste of feeling for\\nthings past, and so, even though this praise was grateful to him, he\\ntried to draw his visitors away to a third picture.\\n\\nBut Vronsky asked whether the picture was for sale. To Mihailov at that\\nmoment, excited by visitors, it was extremely distasteful to speak of\\nmoney matters.\\n\\n“It is put up there to be sold,” he answered, scowling gloomily.\\n\\nWhen the visitors had gone, Mihailov sat down opposite the picture of\\nPilate and Christ, and in his mind went over what had been said, and\\nwhat, though not said, had been implied by those visitors. And, strange\\nto say, what had had such weight with him, while they were there and\\nwhile he mentally put himself at their point of view, suddenly lost all\\nimportance for him. He began to look at his picture with all his own\\nfull artist vision, and was soon in that mood of conviction of the\\nperfectibility, and so of the significance, of his picture—a conviction\\nessential to the most intense fervor, excluding all other interests—in\\nwhich alone he could work.\\n\\nChrist’s foreshortened leg was not right, though. He took his palette\\nand began to work. As he corrected the leg he looked continually at the\\nfigure of John in the background, which his visitors had not even\\nnoticed, but which he knew was beyond perfection. When he had finished\\nthe leg he wanted to touch that figure, but he felt too much excited\\nfor it. He was equally unable to work when he was cold and when he was\\ntoo much affected and saw everything too much. There was only one stage\\nin the transition from coldness to inspiration, at which work was\\npossible. Today he was too much agitated. He would have covered the\\npicture, but he stopped, holding the cloth in his hand, and, smiling\\nblissfully, gazed a long while at the figure of John. At last, as it\\nwere regretfully tearing himself away, he dropped the cloth, and,\\nexhausted but happy, went home.\\n\\nVronsky, Anna, and Golenishtchev, on their way home, were particularly\\nlively and cheerful. They talked of Mihailov and his pictures. The word\\n_talent_, by which they meant an inborn, almost physical, aptitude\\napart from brain and heart, and in which they tried to find an\\nexpression for all the artist had gained from life, recurred\\nparticularly often in their talk, as though it were necessary for them\\nto sum up what they had no conception of, though they wanted to talk of\\nit. They said that there was no denying his talent, but that his talent\\ncould not develop for want of education—the common defect of our\\nRussian artists. But the picture of the boys had imprinted itself on\\ntheir memories, and they were continually coming back to it. “What an\\nexquisite thing! How he has succeeded in it, and how simply! He doesn’t\\neven comprehend how good it is. Yes, I mustn’t let it slip; I must buy\\nit,” said Vronsky 13\\n\\nMihailov sold Vronsky his picture, and agreed to paint a portrait of\\nAnna. On the day fixed he came and began the work.\\n\\nFrom the fifth sitting the portrait impressed everyone, especially\\nVronsky, not only by its resemblance, but by its characteristic beauty.\\nIt was strange how Mihailov could have discovered just her\\ncharacteristic beauty. “One needs to know and love her as I have loved\\nher to discover the very sweetest expression of her soul,” Vronsky\\nthought, though it was only from this portrait that he had himself\\nlearned this sweetest expression of her soul. But the expression was so\\ntrue that he, and others too, fancied they had long known it.\\n\\n“I have been struggling on for ever so long without doing anything,” he\\nsaid of his own portrait of her, “and he just looked and painted it.\\nThat’s where technique comes in.”\\n\\n“That will come,” was the consoling reassurance given him by\\nGolenishtchev, in whose view Vronsky had both talent, and what was most\\nimportant, culture, giving him a wider outlook on art. Golenishtchev’s\\nfaith in Vronsky’s talent was propped up by his own need of Vronsky’s\\nsympathy and approval for his own articles and ideas, and he felt that\\nthe praise and support must be mutual.\\n\\nIn another man’s house, and especially in Vronsky’s palazzo, Mihailov\\nwas quite a different man from what he was in his studio. He behaved\\nwith hostile courtesy, as though he were afraid of coming closer to\\npeople he did not respect. He called Vronsky “your excellency,” and\\nnotwithstanding Anna’s and Vronsky’s invitations, he would never stay\\nto dinner, nor come except for the sittings. Anna was even more\\nfriendly to him than to other people, and was very grateful for her\\nportrait. Vronsky was more than cordial with him, and was obviously\\ninterested to know the artist’s opinion of his picture. Golenishtchev\\nnever let slip an opportunity of instilling sound ideas about art into\\nMihailov. But Mihailov remained equally chilly to all of them. Anna was\\naware from his eyes that he liked looking at her, but he avoided\\nconversation with her. Vronsky’s talk about his painting he met with\\nstubborn silence, and he was as stubbornly silent when he was shown\\nVronsky’s picture. He was unmistakably bored by Golenishtchev’s\\nconversation, and he did not attempt to oppose him.\\n\\nAltogether Mihailov, with his reserved and disagreeable, as it were,\\nhostile attitude, was quite disliked by them as they got to know him\\nbetter; and they were glad when the sittings were over, and they were\\nleft with a magnificent portrait in their possession, and he gave up\\ncoming. Golenishtchev was the first to give expression to an idea that\\nhad occurred to all of them, which was that Mihailov was simply jealous\\nof Vronsky.\\n\\n“Not envious, let us say, since he has _talent_; but it annoys him that\\na wealthy man of the highest society, and a count, too (you know they\\nall detest a title), can, without any particular trouble, do as well,\\nif not better, than he who has devoted all his life to it. And more\\nthan all, it’s a question of culture, which he is without.”\\n\\nVronsky defended Mihailov, but at the bottom of his heart he believed\\nit, because in his view a man of a different, lower world would be sure\\nto be envious.\\n\\nAnna’s portrait—the same subject painted from nature both by him and by\\nMihailov—ought to have shown Vronsky the difference between him and\\nMihailov; but he did not see it. Only after Mihailov’s portrait was\\npainted he left off painting his portrait of Anna, deciding that it was\\nnow not needed. His picture of mediæval life he went on with. And he\\nhimself, and Golenishtchev, and still more Anna, thought it very good,\\nbecause it was far more like the celebrated pictures they knew than\\nMihailov’s picture.\\n\\nMihailov meanwhile, although Anna’s portrait greatly fascinated him,\\nwas even more glad than they were when the sittings were over, and he\\nhad no longer to listen to Golenishtchev’s disquisitions upon art, and\\ncould forget about Vronsky’s painting. He knew that Vronsky could not\\nbe prevented from amusing himself with painting; he knew that he and\\nall dilettanti had a perfect right to paint what they liked, but it was\\ndistasteful to him. A man could not be prevented from making himself a\\nbig wax doll, and kissing it. But if the man were to come with the doll\\nand sit before a man in love, and begin caressing his doll as the lover\\ncaressed the woman he loved, it would be distasteful to the lover. Just\\nsuch a distasteful sensation was what Mihailov felt at the sight of\\nVronsky’s painting: he felt it both ludicrous and irritating, both\\npitiable and offensive.\\n\\nVronsky’s interest in painting and the Middle Ages did not last long.\\nHe had enough taste for painting to be unable to finish his picture.\\nThe picture came to a standstill. He was vaguely aware that its\\ndefects, inconspicuous at first, would be glaring if he were to go on\\nwith it. The same experience befell him as Golenishtchev, who felt that\\nhe had nothing to say, and continually deceived himself with the theory\\nthat his idea was not yet mature, that he was working it out and\\ncollecting materials. This exasperated and tortured Golenishtchev, but\\nVronsky was incapable of deceiving and torturing himself, and even more\\nincapable of exasperation. With his characteristic decision, without\\nexplanation or apology, he simply ceased working at painting.\\n\\nBut without this occupation, the life of Vronsky and of Anna, who\\nwondered at his loss of interest in it, struck them as intolerably\\ntedious in an Italian town. The palazzo suddenly seemed so obtrusively\\nold and dirty, the spots on the curtains, the cracks in the floors, the\\nbroken plaster on the cornices became so disagreeably obvious, and the\\neverlasting sameness of Golenishtchev, and the Italian professor and\\nthe German traveler became so wearisome, that they had to make some\\nchange. They resolved to go to Russia, to the country. In Petersburg\\nVronsky intended to arrange a partition of the land with his brother,\\nwhile Anna meant to see her son. The summer they intended to spend on\\nVronsky’s great family estate 14\\n\\nLevin had been married three months. He was happy, but not at all in\\nthe way he had expected to be. At every step he found his former dreams\\ndisappointed, and new, unexpected surprises of happiness. He was happy;\\nbut on entering upon family life he saw at every step that it was\\nutterly different from what he had imagined. At every step he\\nexperienced what a man would experience who, after admiring the smooth,\\nhappy course of a little boat on a lake, should get himself into that\\nlittle boat. He saw that it was not all sitting still, floating\\nsmoothly; that one had to think too, not for an instant to forget where\\none was floating; and that there was water under one, and that one must\\nrow; and that his unaccustomed hands would be sore; and that it was\\nonly to look at it that was easy; but that doing it, though very\\ndelightful, was very difficult.\\n\\nAs a bachelor, when he had watched other people’s married life, seen\\nthe petty cares, the squabbles, the jealousy, he had only smiled\\ncontemptuously in his heart. In his future married life there could be,\\nhe was convinced, nothing of that sort; even the external forms,\\nindeed, he fancied, must be utterly unlike the life of others in\\neverything. And all of a sudden, instead of his life with his wife\\nbeing made on an individual pattern, it was, on the contrary, entirely\\nmade up of the pettiest details, which he had so despised before, but\\nwhich now, by no will of his own, had gained an extraordinary\\nimportance that it was useless to contend against. And Levin saw that\\nthe organization of all these details was by no means so easy as he had\\nfancied before. Although Levin believed himself to have the most exact\\nconceptions of domestic life, unconsciously, like all men, he pictured\\ndomestic life as the happiest enjoyment of love, with nothing to hinder\\nand no petty cares to distract. He ought, as he conceived the position,\\nto do his work, and to find repose from it in the happiness of love.\\nShe ought to be beloved, and nothing more. But, like all men, he forgot\\nthat she too would want work. And he was surprised that she, his\\npoetic, exquisite Kitty, could, not merely in the first weeks, but even\\nin the first days of their married life, think, remember, and busy\\nherself about tablecloths, and furniture, about mattresses for\\nvisitors, about a tray, about the cook, and the dinner, and so on.\\nWhile they were still engaged, he had been struck by the definiteness\\nwith which she had declined the tour abroad and decided to go into the\\ncountry, as though she knew of something she wanted, and could still\\nthink of something outside her love. This had jarred upon him then, and\\nnow her trivial cares and anxieties jarred upon him several times. But\\nhe saw that this was essential for her. And, loving her as he did,\\nthough he did not understand the reason of them, and jeered at these\\ndomestic pursuits, he could not help admiring them. He jeered at the\\nway in which she arranged the furniture they had brought from Moscow;\\nrearranged their room; hung up curtains; prepared rooms for visitors; a\\nroom for Dolly; saw after an abode for her new maid; ordered dinner of\\nthe old cook; came into collision with Agafea Mihalovna, taking from\\nher the charge of the stores. He saw how the old cook smiled, admiring\\nher, and listening to her inexperienced, impossible orders, how\\nmournfully and tenderly Agafea Mihalovna shook her head over the young\\nmistress’s new arrangements. He saw that Kitty was extraordinarily\\nsweet when, laughing and crying, she came to tell him that her maid,\\nMasha, was used to looking upon her as her young lady, and so no one\\nobeyed her. It seemed to him sweet, but strange, and he thought it\\nwould have been better without this.\\n\\nHe did not know how great a sense of change she was experiencing; she,\\nwho at home had sometimes wanted some favorite dish, or sweets, without\\nthe possibility of getting either, now could order what she liked, buy\\npounds of sweets, spend as much money as she liked, and order any\\npuddings she pleased.\\n\\nShe was dreaming with delight now of Dolly’s coming to them with her\\nchildren, especially because she would order for the children their\\nfavorite puddings and Dolly would appreciate all her new housekeeping.\\nShe did not know herself why and wherefore, but the arranging of her\\nhouse had an irresistible attraction for her. Instinctively feeling the\\napproach of spring, and knowing that there would be days of rough\\nweather too, she built her nest as best she could, and was in haste at\\nthe same time to build it and to learn how to do it.\\n\\nThis care for domestic details in Kitty, so opposed to Levin’s ideal of\\nexalted happiness, was at first one of the disappointments; and this\\nsweet care of her household, the aim of which he did not understand,\\nbut could not help loving, was one of the new happy surprises.\\n\\nAnother disappointment and happy surprise came in their quarrels. Levin\\ncould never have conceived that between him and his wife any relations\\ncould arise other than tender, respectful and loving, and all at once\\nin the very early days they quarreled, so that she said he did not care\\nfor her, that he cared for no one but himself, burst into tears, and\\nwrung her arms.\\n\\nThis first quarrel arose from Levin’s having gone out to a new\\nfarmhouse and having been away half an hour too long, because he had\\ntried to get home by a short cut and had lost his way. He drove home\\nthinking of nothing but her, of her love, of his own happiness, and the\\nnearer he drew to home, the warmer was his tenderness for her. He ran\\ninto the room with the same feeling, with an even stronger feeling than\\nhe had had when he reached the Shtcherbatskys’ house to make his offer.\\nAnd suddenly he was met by a lowering expression he had never seen in\\nher. He would have kissed her; she pushed him away.\\n\\n“What is it?”\\n\\n“You’ve been enjoying yourself,” she began, trying to be calm and\\nspiteful. But as soon as she opened her mouth, a stream of reproach, of\\nsenseless jealousy, of all that had been torturing her during that half\\nhour which she had spent sitting motionless at the window, burst from\\nher. It was only then, for the first time, that he clearly understood\\nwhat he had not understood when he led her out of the church after the\\nwedding. He felt now that he was not simply close to her, but that he\\ndid not know where he ended and she began. He felt this from the\\nagonizing sensation of division that he experienced at that instant. He\\nwas offended for the first instant, but the very same second he felt\\nthat he could not be offended by her, that she was himself. He felt for\\nthe first moment as a man feels when, having suddenly received a\\nviolent blow from behind, he turns round, angry and eager to avenge\\nhimself, to look for his antagonist, and finds that it is he himself\\nwho has accidentally struck himself, that there is no one to be angry\\nwith, and that he must put up with and try to soothe the pain.\\n\\nNever afterwards did he feel it with such intensity, but this first\\ntime he could not for a long while get over it. His natural feeling\\nurged him to defend himself, to prove to her she was wrong; but to\\nprove her wrong would mean irritating her still more and making the\\nrupture greater that was the cause of all his suffering. One habitual\\nfeeling impelled him to get rid of the blame and to pass it on to her.\\nAnother feeling, even stronger, impelled him as quickly as possible to\\nsmooth over the rupture without letting it grow greater. To remain\\nunder such undeserved reproach was wretched, but to make her suffer by\\njustifying himself was worse still. Like a man half-awake in an agony\\nof pain, he wanted to tear out, to fling away the aching place, and\\ncoming to his senses, he felt that the aching place was himself. He\\ncould do nothing but try to help the aching place to bear it, and this\\nhe tried to do.\\n\\nThey made peace. She, recognizing that she was wrong, though she did\\nnot say so, became tenderer to him, and they experienced new, redoubled\\nhappiness in their love. But that did not prevent such quarrels from\\nhappening again, and exceedingly often too, on the most unexpected and\\ntrivial grounds. These quarrels frequently arose from the fact that\\nthey did not yet know what was of importance to each other and that all\\nthis early period they were both often in a bad temper. When one was in\\na good temper, and the other in a bad temper, the peace was not broken;\\nbut when both happened to be in an ill-humor, quarrels sprang up from\\nsuch incomprehensibly trifling causes, that they could never remember\\nafterwards what they had quarreled about. It is true that when they\\nwere both in a good temper their enjoyment of life was redoubled. But\\nstill this first period of their married life was a difficult time for\\nthem.\\n\\nDuring all this early time they had a peculiarly vivid sense of\\ntension, as it were, a tugging in opposite directions of the chain by\\nwhich they were bound. Altogether their honeymoon—that is to say, the\\nmonth after their wedding—from which from tradition Levin expected so\\nmuch, was not merely not a time of sweetness, but remained in the\\nmemories of both as the bitterest and most humiliating period in their\\nlives. They both alike tried in later life to blot out from their\\nmemories all the monstrous, shameful incidents of that morbid period,\\nwhen both were rarely in a normal frame of mind, both were rarely quite\\nthemselves.\\n\\nIt was only in the third month of their married life, after their\\nreturn from Moscow, where they had been staying for a month, that their\\nlife began to go more smoothly 15\\n\\nThey had just come back from Moscow, and were glad to be alone. He was\\nsitting at the writing-table in his study, writing. She, wearing the\\ndark lilac dress she had worn during the first days of their married\\nlife, and put on again today, a dress particularly remembered and loved\\nby him, was sitting on the sofa, the same old-fashioned leather sofa\\nwhich had always stood in the study in Levin’s father’s and\\ngrandfather’s days. She was sewing at _broderie anglaise_. He thought\\nand wrote, never losing the happy consciousness of her presence. His\\nwork, both on the land and on the book, in which the principles of the\\nnew land system were to be laid down, had not been abandoned; but just\\nas formerly these pursuits and ideas had seemed to him petty and\\ntrivial in comparison with the darkness that overspread all life, now\\nthey seemed as unimportant and petty in comparison with the life that\\nlay before him suffused with the brilliant light of happiness. He went\\non with his work, but he felt now that the center of gravity of his\\nattention had passed to something else, and that consequently he looked\\nat his work quite differently and more clearly. Formerly this work had\\nbeen for him an escape from life. Formerly he had felt that without\\nthis work his life would be too gloomy. Now these pursuits were\\nnecessary for him that life might not be too uniformly bright. Taking\\nup his manuscript, reading through what he had written, he found with\\npleasure that the work was worth his working at. Many of his old ideas\\nseemed to him superfluous and extreme, but many blanks became distinct\\nto him when he reviewed the whole thing in his memory. He was writing\\nnow a new chapter on the causes of the present disastrous condition of\\nagriculture in Russia. He maintained that the poverty of Russia arises\\nnot merely from the anomalous distribution of landed property and\\nmisdirected reforms, but that what had contributed of late years to\\nthis result was the civilization from without abnormally grafted upon\\nRussia, especially facilities of communication, as railways, leading to\\ncentralization in towns, the development of luxury, and the consequent\\ndevelopment of manufactures, credit and its accompaniment of\\nspeculation—all to the detriment of agriculture. It seemed to him that\\nin a normal development of wealth in a state all these phenomena would\\narise only when a considerable amount of labor had been put into\\nagriculture, when it had come under regular, or at least definite,\\nconditions; that the wealth of a country ought to increase\\nproportionally, and especially in such a way that other sources of\\nwealth should not outstrip agriculture; that in harmony with a certain\\nstage of agriculture there should be means of communication\\ncorresponding to it, and that in our unsettled condition of the land,\\nrailways, called into being by political and not by economic needs,\\nwere premature, and instead of promoting agriculture, as was expected\\nof them, they were competing with agriculture and promoting the\\ndevelopment of manufactures and credit, and so arresting its progress;\\nand that just as the one-sided and premature development of one organ\\nin an animal would hinder its general development, so in the general\\ndevelopment of wealth in Russia, credit, facilities of communication,\\nmanufacturing activity, indubitably necessary in Europe, where they had\\narisen in their proper time, had with us only done harm, by throwing\\ninto the background the chief question calling for settlement—the\\nquestion of the organization of agriculture.\\n\\nWhile he was writing his ideas she was thinking how unnaturally cordial\\nher husband had been to young Prince Tcharsky, who had, with great want\\nof tact, flirted with her the day before they left Moscow. “He’s\\njealous,” she thought. “Goodness! how sweet and silly he is! He’s\\njealous of me! If he knew that I think no more of them than of Piotr\\nthe cook,” she thought, looking at his head and red neck with a feeling\\nof possession strange to herself. “Though it’s a pity to take him from\\nhis work (but he has plenty of time!), I must look at his face; will he\\nfeel I’m looking at him? I wish he’d turn round ... I’ll _will_ him\\nto!” and she opened her eyes wide, as though to intensify the influence\\nof her gaze.\\n\\n“Yes, they draw away all the sap and give a false appearance of\\nprosperity,” he muttered, stopping to write, and, feeling that she was\\nlooking at him and smiling, he looked round.\\n\\n“Well?” he queried, smiling, and getting up.\\n\\n“He looked round,” she thought.\\n\\n“It’s nothing; I wanted you to look round,” she said, watching him, and\\ntrying to guess whether he was vexed at being interrupted or not.\\n\\n“How happy we are alone together!—I am, that is,” he said, going up to\\nher with a radiant smile of happiness.\\n\\n“I’m just as happy. I’ll never go anywhere, especially not to Moscow.”\\n\\n“And what were you thinking about?”\\n\\n“I? I was thinking.... No, no, go along, go on writing; don’t break\\noff,” she said, pursing up her lips, “and I must cut out these little\\nholes now, do you see?”\\n\\nShe took up her scissors and began cutting them out.\\n\\n“No; tell me, what was it?” he said, sitting down beside her and\\nwatching the tiny scissors moving round.\\n\\n“Oh! what was I thinking about? I was thinking about Moscow, about the\\nback of your head.”\\n\\n“Why should I, of all people, have such happiness! It’s unnatural, too\\ngood,” he said, kissing her hand.\\n\\n“I feel quite the opposite; the better things are, the more natural it\\nseems to me.”\\n\\n“And you’ve got a little curl loose,” he said, carefully turning her\\nhead round.\\n\\n“A little curl, oh yes. No, no, we are busy at our work!”\\n\\nWork did not progress further, and they darted apart from one another\\nlike culprits when Kouzma came in to announce that tea was ready.\\n\\n“Have they come from the town?” Levin asked Kouzma.\\n\\n“They’ve just come; they’re unpacking the things.”\\n\\n“Come quickly,” she said to him as she went out of the study, “or else\\nI shall read your letters without you.”\\n\\nLeft alone, after putting his manuscripts together in the new portfolio\\nbought by her, he washed his hands at the new washstand with the\\nelegant fittings, that had all made their appearance with her. Levin\\nsmiled at his own thoughts, and shook his head disapprovingly at those\\nthoughts; a feeling akin to remorse fretted him. There was something\\nshameful, effeminate, Capuan, as he called it to himself, in his\\npresent mode of life. “It’s not right to go on like this,” he thought.\\n“It’ll soon be three months, and I’m doing next to nothing. Today,\\nalmost for the first time, I set to work seriously, and what happened?\\nI did nothing but begin and throw it aside. Even my ordinary pursuits I\\nhave almost given up. On the land I scarcely walk or drive about at all\\nto look after things. Either I am loath to leave her, or I see she’s\\ndull alone. And I used to think that, before marriage, life was nothing\\nmuch, somehow didn’t count, but that after marriage, life began in\\nearnest. And here almost three months have passed, and I have spent my\\ntime so idly and unprofitably. No, this won’t do; I must begin. Of\\ncourse, it’s not her fault. She’s not to blame in any way. I ought\\nmyself to be firmer, to maintain my masculine independence of action;\\nor else I shall get into such ways, and she’ll get used to them too....\\nOf course she’s not to blame,” he told himself.\\n\\nBut it is hard for anyone who is dissatisfied not to blame someone\\nelse, and especially the person nearest of all to him, for the ground\\nof his dissatisfaction. And it vaguely came into Levin’s mind that she\\nherself was not to blame (she could not be to blame for anything), but\\nwhat was to blame was her education, too superficial and frivolous.\\n(“That fool Tcharsky: she wanted, I know, to stop him, but didn’t know\\nhow to.”) “Yes, apart from her interest in the house (that she has),\\napart from dress and _broderie anglaise_, she has no serious interests.\\nNo interest in her work, in the estate, in the peasants, nor in music,\\nthough she’s rather good at it, nor in reading. She does nothing, and\\nis perfectly satisfied.” Levin, in his heart, censured this, and did\\nnot as yet understand that she was preparing for that period of\\nactivity which was to come for her when she would at once be the wife\\nof her husband and mistress of the house, and would bear, and nurse,\\nand bring up children. He knew not that she was instinctively aware of\\nthis, and preparing herself for this time of terrible toil, did not\\nreproach herself for the moments of carelessness and happiness in her\\nlove that she enjoyed now while gaily building her nest for the future 16\\n\\nWhen Levin went upstairs, his wife was sitting near the new silver\\nsamovar behind the new tea service, and, having settled old Agafea\\nMihalovna at a little table with a full cup of tea, was reading a\\nletter from Dolly, with whom they were in continual and frequent\\ncorrespondence.\\n\\n“You see, your good lady’s settled me here, told me to sit a bit with\\nher,” said Agafea Mihalovna, smiling affectionately at Kitty.\\n\\nIn these words of Agafea Mihalovna, Levin read the final act of the\\ndrama which had been enacted of late between her and Kitty. He saw\\nthat, in spite of Agafea Mihalovna’s feelings being hurt by a new\\nmistress taking the reins of government out of her hands, Kitty had yet\\nconquered her and made her love her.\\n\\n“Here, I opened your letter too,” said Kitty, handing him an illiterate\\nletter. “It’s from that woman, I think, your brother’s....” she said.\\n“I did not read it through. This is from my people and from Dolly.\\nFancy! Dolly took Tanya and Grisha to a children’s ball at the\\nSarmatskys’: Tanya was a French marquise.”\\n\\nBut Levin did not hear her. Flushing, he took the letter from Marya\\nNikolaevna, his brother’s former mistress, and began to read it. This\\nwas the second letter he had received from Marya Nikolaevna. In the\\nfirst letter, Marya Nikolaevna wrote that his brother had sent her away\\nfor no fault of hers, and, with touching simplicity, added that though\\nshe was in want again, she asked for nothing, and wished for nothing,\\nbut was only tormented by the thought that Nikolay Dmitrievitch would\\ncome to grief without her, owing to the weak state of his health, and\\nbegged his brother to look after him. Now she wrote quite differently.\\nShe had found Nikolay Dmitrievitch, had again made it up with him in\\nMoscow, and had moved with him to a provincial town, where he had\\nreceived a post in the government service. But that he had quarreled\\nwith the head official, and was on his way back to Moscow, only he had\\nbeen taken so ill on the road that it was doubtful if he would ever\\nleave his bed again, she wrote. “It’s always of you he has talked, and,\\nbesides, he has no more money left.”\\n\\n“Read this; Dolly writes about you,” Kitty was beginning, with a smile;\\nbut she stopped suddenly, noticing the changed expression on her\\nhusband’s face.\\n\\n“What is it? What’s the matter?”\\n\\n“She writes to me that Nikolay, my brother, is at death’s door. I shall\\ngo to him.”\\n\\nKitty’s face changed at once. Thoughts of Tanya as a marquise, of\\nDolly, all had vanished.\\n\\n“When are you going?” she said.\\n\\n“Tomorrow.”\\n\\n“And I will go with you, can I?” she said.\\n\\n“Kitty! What are you thinking of?” he said reproachfully.\\n\\n“How do you mean?” offended that he should seem to take her suggestion\\nunwillingly and with vexation. “Why shouldn’t I go? I shan’t be in your\\nway. I....”\\n\\n“I’m going because my brother is dying,” said Levin. “Why should\\nyou....”\\n\\n“Why? For the same reason as you.”\\n\\n“And, at a moment of such gravity for me, she only thinks of her being\\ndull by herself,” thought Levin. And this lack of candor in a matter of\\nsuch gravity infuriated him.\\n\\n“It’s out of the question,” he said sternly.\\n\\nAgafea Mihalovna, seeing that it was coming to a quarrel, gently put\\ndown her cup and withdrew. Kitty did not even notice her. The tone in\\nwhich her husband had said the last words wounded her, especially\\nbecause he evidently did not believe what she had said.\\n\\n“I tell you, that if you go, I shall come with you; I shall certainly\\ncome,” she said hastily and wrathfully. “Why out of the question? Why\\ndo you say it’s out of the question?”\\n\\n“Because it’ll be going God knows where, by all sorts of roads and to\\nall sorts of hotels. You would be a hindrance to me,” said Levin,\\ntrying to be cool.\\n\\n“Not at all. I don’t want anything. Where you can go, I can....”\\n\\n“Well, for one thing then, because this woman’s there whom you can’t\\nmeet.”\\n\\n“I don’t know and don’t care to know who’s there and what. I know that\\nmy husband’s brother is dying and my husband is going to him, and I go\\nwith my husband too....”\\n\\n“Kitty! Don’t get angry. But just think a little: this is a matter of\\nsuch importance that I can’t bear to think that you should bring in a\\nfeeling of weakness, of dislike to being left alone. Come, you’ll be\\ndull alone, so go and stay at Moscow a little.”\\n\\n“There, you always ascribe base, vile motives to me,” she said with\\ntears of wounded pride and fury. “I didn’t mean, it wasn’t weakness, it\\nwasn’t ... I feel that it’s my duty to be with my husband when he’s in\\ntrouble, but you try on purpose to hurt me, you try on purpose not to\\nunderstand....”\\n\\n“No; this is awful! To be such a slave!” cried Levin, getting up, and\\nunable to restrain his anger any longer. But at the same second he felt\\nthat he was beating himself.\\n\\n“Then why did you marry? You could have been free. Why did you, if you\\nregret it?” she said, getting up and running away into the\\ndrawing-room.\\n\\nWhen he went to her, she was sobbing.\\n\\nHe began to speak, trying to find words not to dissuade but simply to\\nsoothe her. But she did not heed him, and would not agree to anything.\\nHe bent down to her and took her hand, which resisted him. He kissed\\nher hand, kissed her hair, kissed her hand again—still she was silent.\\nBut when he took her face in both his hands and said “Kitty!” she\\nsuddenly recovered herself, and began to cry, and they were reconciled.\\n\\nIt was decided that they should go together the next day. Levin told\\nhis wife that he believed she wanted to go simply in order to be of\\nuse, agreed that Marya Nikolaevna’s being with his brother did not make\\nher going improper, but he set off at the bottom of his heart\\ndissatisfied both with her and with himself. He was dissatisfied with\\nher for being unable to make up her mind to let him go when it was\\nnecessary (and how strange it was for him to think that he, so lately\\nhardly daring to believe in such happiness as that she could love\\nhim—now was unhappy because she loved him too much!), and he was\\ndissatisfied with himself for not showing more strength of will. Even\\ngreater was the feeling of disagreement at the bottom of his heart as\\nto her not needing to consider the woman who was with his brother, and\\nhe thought with horror of all the contingencies they might meet with.\\nThe mere idea of his wife, his Kitty, being in the same room with a\\ncommon wench, set him shuddering with horror and loathing 17\\n\\nThe hotel of the provincial town where Nikolay Levin was lying ill was\\none of those provincial hotels which are constructed on the newest\\nmodel of modern improvements, with the best intentions of cleanliness,\\ncomfort, and even elegance, but owing to the public that patronizes\\nthem, are with astounding rapidity transformed into filthy taverns with\\na pretension of modern improvement that only makes them worse than the\\nold-fashioned, honestly filthy hotels. This hotel had already reached\\nthat stage, and the soldier in a filthy uniform smoking in the entry,\\nsupposed to stand for a hall-porter, and the cast-iron, slippery, dark,\\nand disagreeable staircase, and the free and easy waiter in a filthy\\nfrock coat, and the common dining-room with a dusty bouquet of wax\\nflowers adorning the table, and filth, dust, and disorder everywhere,\\nand at the same time the sort of modern up-to-date self-complacent\\nrailway uneasiness of this hotel, aroused a most painful feeling in\\nLevin after their fresh young life, especially because the impression\\nof falsity made by the hotel was so out of keeping with what awaited\\nthem.\\n\\nAs is invariably the case, after they had been asked at what price they\\nwanted rooms, it appeared that there was not one decent room for them;\\none decent room had been taken by the inspector of railroads, another\\nby a lawyer from Moscow, a third by Princess Astafieva from the\\ncountry. There remained only one filthy room, next to which they\\npromised that another should be empty by the evening. Feeling angry\\nwith his wife because what he had expected had come to pass, which was\\nthat at the moment of arrival, when his heart throbbed with emotion and\\nanxiety to know how his brother was getting on, he should have to be\\nseeing after her, instead of rushing straight to his brother, Levin\\nconducted her to the room assigned them.\\n\\n“Go, do go!” she said, looking at him with timid and guilty eyes.\\n\\nHe went out of the door without a word, and at once stumbled over Marya\\nNikolaevna, who had heard of his arrival and had not dared to go in to\\nsee him. She was just the same as when he saw her in Moscow; the same\\nwoolen gown, and bare arms and neck, and the same good-naturedly\\nstupid, pockmarked face, only a little plumper.\\n\\n“Well, how is he? how is he?”\\n\\n“Very bad. He can’t get up. He has kept expecting you. He.... Are you\\n... with your wife?”\\n\\nLevin did not for the first moment understand what it was confused her,\\nbut she immediately enlightened him.\\n\\n“I’ll go away. I’ll go down to the kitchen,” she brought out. “Nikolay\\nDmitrievitch will be delighted. He heard about it, and knows your lady,\\nand remembers her abroad.”\\n\\nLevin realized that she meant his wife, and did not know what answer to\\nmake.\\n\\n“Come along, come along to him!” he said.\\n\\nBut as soon as he moved, the door of his room opened and Kitty peeped\\nout. Levin crimsoned both from shame and anger with his wife, who had\\nput herself and him in such a difficult position; but Marya Nikolaevna\\ncrimsoned still more. She positively shrank together and flushed to the\\npoint of tears, and clutching the ends of her apron in both hands,\\ntwisted them in her red fingers without knowing what to say and what to\\ndo.\\n\\nFor the first instant Levin saw an expression of eager curiosity in the\\neyes with which Kitty looked at this awful woman, so incomprehensible\\nto her; but it lasted only a single instant.\\n\\n“Well! how is he?” she turned to her husband and then to her.\\n\\n“But one can’t go on talking in the passage like this!” Levin said,\\nlooking angrily at a gentleman who walked jauntily at that instant\\nacross the corridor, as though about his affairs.\\n\\n“Well then, come in,” said Kitty, turning to Marya Nikolaevna, who had\\nrecovered herself, but noticing her husband’s face of dismay, “or go\\non; go, and then come for me,” she said, and went back into the room.\\n\\nLevin went to his brother’s room. He had not in the least expected what\\nhe saw and felt in his brother’s room. He had expected to find him in\\nthe same state of self-deception which he had heard was so frequent\\nwith the consumptive, and which had struck him so much during his\\nbrother’s visit in the autumn. He had expected to find the physical\\nsigns of the approach of death more marked—greater weakness, greater\\nemaciation, but still almost the same condition of things. He had\\nexpected himself to feel the same distress at the loss of the brother\\nhe loved and the same horror in face of death as he had felt then, only\\nin a greater degree. And he had prepared himself for this; but he found\\nsomething utterly different.\\n\\nIn a little dirty room with the painted panels of its walls filthy with\\nspittle, and conversation audible through the thin partition from the\\nnext room, in a stifling atmosphere saturated with impurities, on a\\nbedstead moved away from the wall, there lay covered with a quilt, a\\nbody. One arm of this body was above the quilt, and the wrist, huge as\\na rake-handle, was attached, inconceivably it seemed, to the thin, long\\nbone of the arm smooth from the beginning to the middle. The head lay\\nsideways on the pillow. Levin could see the scanty locks wet with sweat\\non the temples and tense, transparent-looking forehead.\\n\\n“It cannot be that that fearful body was my brother Nikolay?” thought\\nLevin. But he went closer, saw the face, and doubt became impossible.\\nIn spite of the terrible change in the face, Levin had only to glance\\nat those eager eyes raised at his approach, only to catch the faint\\nmovement of the mouth under the sticky mustache, to realize the\\nterrible truth that this death-like body was his living brother.\\n\\nThe glittering eyes looked sternly and reproachfully at his brother as\\nhe drew near. And immediately this glance established a living\\nrelationship between living men. Levin immediately felt the reproach in\\nthe eyes fixed on him, and felt remorse at his own happiness.\\n\\nWhen Konstantin took him by the hand, Nikolay smiled. The smile was\\nfaint, scarcely perceptible, and in spite of the smile the stern\\nexpression of the eyes was unchanged.\\n\\n“You did not expect to find me like this,” he articulated with effort.\\n\\n“Yes ... no,” said Levin, hesitating over his words. “How was it you\\ndidn’t let me know before, that is, at the time of my wedding? I made\\ninquiries in all directions.”\\n\\nHe had to talk so as not to be silent, and he did not know what to say,\\nespecially as his brother made no reply, and simply stared without\\ndropping his eyes, and evidently penetrated to the inner meaning of\\neach word. Levin told his brother that his wife had come with him.\\nNikolay expressed pleasure, but said he was afraid of frightening her\\nby his condition. A silence followed. Suddenly Nikolay stirred, and\\nbegan to say something. Levin expected something of peculiar gravity\\nand importance from the expression of his face, but Nikolay began\\nspeaking of his health. He found fault with the doctor, regretting he\\nhad not a celebrated Moscow doctor. Levin saw that he still hoped.\\n\\nSeizing the first moment of silence, Levin got up, anxious to escape,\\nif only for an instant, from his agonizing emotion, and said that he\\nwould go and fetch his wife.\\n\\n“Very well, and I’ll tell her to tidy up here. It’s dirty and stinking\\nhere, I expect. Marya! clear up the room,” the sick man said with\\neffort. “Oh, and when you’ve cleared up, go away yourself,” he added,\\nlooking inquiringly at his brother.\\n\\nLevin made no answer. Going out into the corridor, he stopped short. He\\nhad said he would fetch his wife, but now, taking stock of the emotion\\nhe was feeling, he decided that he would try on the contrary to\\npersuade her not to go in to the sick man. “Why should she suffer as I\\nam suffering?” he thought.\\n\\n“Well, how is he?” Kitty asked with a frightened face.\\n\\n“Oh, it’s awful, it’s awful! What did you come for?” said Levin.\\n\\nKitty was silent for a few seconds, looking timidly and ruefully at her\\nhusband; then she went up and took him by the elbow with both hands.\\n\\n“Kostya! take me to him; it will be easier for us to bear it together.\\nYou only take me, take me to him, please, and go away,” she said. “You\\nmust understand that for me to see you, and not to see him, is far more\\npainful. There I might be a help to you and to him. Please, let me!”\\nshe besought her husband, as though the happiness of her life depended\\non it.\\n\\nLevin was obliged to agree, and regaining his composure, and completely\\nforgetting about Marya Nikolaevna by now, he went again in to his\\nbrother with Kitty.\\n\\nStepping lightly, and continually glancing at her husband, showing him\\na valorous and sympathetic face, Kitty went into the sick-room, and,\\nturning without haste, noiselessly closed the door. With inaudible\\nsteps she went quickly to the sick man’s bedside, and going up so that\\nhe had not to turn his head, she immediately clasped in her fresh young\\nhand the skeleton of his huge hand, pressed it, and began speaking with\\nthat soft eagerness, sympathetic and not jarring, which is peculiar to\\nwomen.\\n\\n“We have met, though we were not acquainted, at Soden,” she said. “You\\nnever thought I was to be your sister?”\\n\\n“You would not have recognized me?” he said, with a radiant smile at\\nher entrance.\\n\\n“Yes, I should. What a good thing you let us know! Not a day has passed\\nthat Kostya has not mentioned you, and been anxious.”\\n\\nBut the sick man’s interest did not last long.\\n\\nBefore she had finished speaking, there had come back into his face the\\nstern, reproachful expression of the dying man’s envy of the living.\\n\\n“I am afraid you are not quite comfortable here,” she said, turning\\naway from his fixed stare, and looking about the room. “We must ask\\nabout another room,” she said to her husband, “so that we might be\\nnearer 18\\n\\nLevin could not look calmly at his brother; he could not himself be\\nnatural and calm in his presence. When he went in to the sick man, his\\neyes and his attention were unconsciously dimmed, and he did not see\\nand did not distinguish the details of his brother’s position. He smelt\\nthe awful odor, saw the dirt, disorder, and miserable condition, and\\nheard the groans, and felt that nothing could be done to help. It never\\nentered his head to analyze the details of the sick man’s situation, to\\nconsider how that body was lying under the quilt, how those emaciated\\nlegs and thighs and spine were lying huddled up, and whether they could\\nnot be made more comfortable, whether anything could not be done to\\nmake things, if not better, at least less bad. It made his blood run\\ncold when he began to think of all these details. He was absolutely\\nconvinced that nothing could be done to prolong his brother’s life or\\nto relieve his suffering. But a sense of his regarding all aid as out\\nof the question was felt by the sick man, and exasperated him. And this\\nmade it still more painful for Levin. To be in the sick-room was agony\\nto him, not to be there still worse. And he was continually, on various\\npretexts, going out of the room, and coming in again, because he was\\nunable to remain alone.\\n\\nBut Kitty thought, and felt, and acted quite differently. On seeing the\\nsick man, she pitied him. And pity in her womanly heart did not arouse\\nat all that feeling of horror and loathing that it aroused in her\\nhusband, but a desire to act, to find out all the details of his state,\\nand to remedy them. And since she had not the slightest doubt that it\\nwas her duty to help him, she had no doubt either that it was possible,\\nand immediately set to work. The very details, the mere thought of\\nwhich reduced her husband to terror, immediately engaged her attention.\\nShe sent for the doctor, sent to the chemist’s, set the maid who had\\ncome with her and Marya Nikolaevna to sweep and dust and scrub; she\\nherself washed up something, washed out something else, laid something\\nunder the quilt. Something was by her directions brought into the\\nsick-room, something else was carried out. She herself went several\\ntimes to her room, regardless of the men she met in the corridor, got\\nout and brought in sheets, pillow cases, towels, and shirts.\\n\\nThe waiter, who was busy with a party of engineers dining in the dining\\nhall, came several times with an irate countenance in answer to her\\nsummons, and could not avoid carrying out her orders, as she gave them\\nwith such gracious insistence that there was no evading her. Levin did\\nnot approve of all this; he did not believe it would be of any good to\\nthe patient. Above all, he feared the patient would be angry at it. But\\nthe sick man, though he seemed and was indifferent about it, was not\\nangry, but only abashed, and on the whole as it were interested in what\\nshe was doing with him. Coming back from the doctor to whom Kitty had\\nsent him, Levin, on opening the door, came upon the sick man at the\\ninstant when, by Kitty’s directions, they were changing his linen. The\\nlong white ridge of his spine, with the huge, prominent shoulder blades\\nand jutting ribs and vertebrae, was bare, and Marya Nikolaevna and the\\nwaiter were struggling with the sleeve of the night shirt, and could\\nnot get the long, limp arm into it. Kitty, hurriedly closing the door\\nafter Levin, was not looking that way; but the sick man groaned, and\\nshe moved rapidly towards him.\\n\\n“Make haste,” she said.\\n\\n“Oh, don’t you come,” said the sick man angrily. “I’ll do it my\\nmyself....”\\n\\n“What say?” queried Marya Nikolaevna. But Kitty heard and saw he was\\nashamed and uncomfortable at being naked before her.\\n\\n“I’m not looking, I’m not looking!” she said, putting the arm in.\\n“Marya Nikolaevna, you come this side, you do it,” she added.\\n\\n“Please go for me, there’s a little bottle in my small bag,” she said,\\nturning to her husband, “you know, in the side pocket; bring it,\\nplease, and meanwhile they’ll finish clearing up here.”\\n\\nReturning with the bottle, Levin found the sick man settled comfortably\\nand everything about him completely changed. The heavy smell was\\nreplaced by the smell of aromatic vinegar, which Kitty with pouting\\nlips and puffed-out, rosy cheeks was squirting through a little pipe.\\nThere was no dust visible anywhere, a rug was laid by the bedside. On\\nthe table stood medicine bottles and decanters tidily arranged, and the\\nlinen needed was folded up there, and Kitty’s _broderie anglaise_. On\\nthe other table by the patient’s bed there were candles and drink and\\npowders. The sick man himself, washed and combed, lay in clean sheets\\non high raised pillows, in a clean night-shirt with a white collar\\nabout his astoundingly thin neck, and with a new expression of hope\\nlooked fixedly at Kitty.\\n\\nThe doctor brought by Levin, and found by him at the club, was not the\\none who had been attending Nikolay Levin, as the patient was\\ndissatisfied with him. The new doctor took up a stethoscope and sounded\\nthe patient, shook his head, prescribed medicine, and with extreme\\nminuteness explained first how to take the medicine and then what diet\\nwas to be kept to. He advised eggs, raw or hardly cooked, and seltzer\\nwater, with warm milk at a certain temperature. When the doctor had\\ngone away the sick man said something to his brother, of which Levin\\ncould distinguish only the last words: “Your Katya.” By the expression\\nwith which he gazed at her, Levin saw that he was praising her. He\\ncalled indeed to Katya, as he called her.\\n\\n“I’m much better already,” he said. “Why, with you I should have got\\nwell long ago. How nice it is!” he took her hand and drew it towards\\nhis lips, but as though afraid she would dislike it he changed his\\nmind, let it go, and only stroked it. Kitty took his hand in both hers\\nand pressed it.\\n\\n“Now turn me over on the left side and go to bed,” he said.\\n\\nNo one could make out what he said but Kitty; she alone understood. She\\nunderstood because she was all the while mentally keeping watch on what\\nhe needed.\\n\\n“On the other side,” she said to her husband, “he always sleeps on that\\nside. Turn him over, it’s so disagreeable calling the servants. I’m not\\nstrong enough. Can you?” she said to Marya Nikolaevna.\\n\\n“I’m afraid not,” answered Marya Nikolaevna.\\n\\nTerrible as it was to Levin to put his arms round that terrible body,\\nto take hold of that under the quilt, of which he preferred to know\\nnothing, under his wife’s influence he made his resolute face that she\\nknew so well, and putting his arms into the bed took hold of the body,\\nbut in spite of his own strength he was struck by the strange heaviness\\nof those powerless limbs. While he was turning him over, conscious of\\nthe huge emaciated arm about his neck, Kitty swiftly and noiselessly\\nturned the pillow, beat it up and settled in it the sick man’s head,\\nsmoothing back his hair, which was sticking again to his moist brow.\\n\\nThe sick man kept his brother’s hand in his own. Levin felt that he\\nmeant to do something with his hand and was pulling it somewhere. Levin\\nyielded with a sinking heart: yes, he drew it to his mouth and kissed\\nit. Levin, shaking with sobs and unable to articulate a word, went out\\nof the room 19\\n\\n“Thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast\\nrevealed them unto babes.” So Levin thought about his wife as he talked\\nto her that evening.\\n\\nLevin thought of the text, not because he considered himself “wise and\\nprudent.” He did not so consider himself, but he could not help knowing\\nthat he had more intellect than his wife and Agafea Mihalovna, and he\\ncould not help knowing that when he thought of death, he thought with\\nall the force of his intellect. He knew too that the brains of many\\ngreat men, whose thoughts he had read, had brooded over death and yet\\nknew not a hundredth part of what his wife and Agafea Mihalovna knew\\nabout it. Different as those two women were, Agafea Mihalovna and\\nKatya, as his brother Nikolay had called her, and as Levin particularly\\nliked to call her now, they were quite alike in this. Both knew,\\nwithout a shade of doubt, what sort of thing life was and what was\\ndeath, and though neither of them could have answered, and would even\\nnot have understood the questions that presented themselves to Levin,\\nboth had no doubt of the significance of this event, and were precisely\\nalike in their way of looking at it, which they shared with millions of\\npeople. The proof that they knew for a certainty the nature of death\\nlay in the fact that they knew without a second of hesitation how to\\ndeal with the dying, and were not frightened of them. Levin and other\\nmen like him, though they could have said a great deal about death,\\nobviously did not know this since they were afraid of death, and were\\nabsolutely at a loss what to do when people were dying. If Levin had\\nbeen alone now with his brother Nikolay, he would have looked at him\\nwith terror, and with still greater terror waited, and would not have\\nknown what else to do.\\n\\nMore than that, he did not know what to say, how to look, how to move.\\nTo talk of outside things seemed to him shocking, impossible, to talk\\nof death and depressing subjects—also impossible. To be silent, also\\nimpossible. “If I look at him he will think I am studying him, I am\\nafraid; if I don’t look at him, he’ll think I’m thinking of other\\nthings. If I walk on tiptoe, he will be vexed; to tread firmly, I’m\\nashamed.” Kitty evidently did not think of herself, and had no time to\\nthink about herself: she was thinking about him because she knew\\nsomething, and all went well. She told him about herself even and about\\nher wedding, and smiled and sympathized with him and petted him, and\\ntalked of cases of recovery and all went well; so then she must know.\\nThe proof that her behavior and Agafea Mihalovna’s was not instinctive,\\nanimal, irrational, was that apart from the physical treatment, the\\nrelief of suffering, both Agafea Mihalovna and Kitty required for the\\ndying man something else more important than the physical treatment,\\nand something which had nothing in common with physical conditions.\\nAgafea Mihalovna, speaking of the man just dead, had said: “Well, thank\\nGod, he took the sacrament and received absolution; God grant each one\\nof us such a death.” Katya in just the same way, besides all her care\\nabout linen, bedsores, drink, found time the very first day to persuade\\nthe sick man of the necessity of taking the sacrament and receiving\\nabsolution.\\n\\nOn getting back from the sick-room to their own two rooms for the\\nnight, Levin sat with hanging head not knowing what to do. Not to speak\\nof supper, of preparing for bed, of considering what they were going to\\ndo, he could not even talk to his wife; he was ashamed to. Kitty, on\\nthe contrary, was more active than usual. She was even livelier than\\nusual. She ordered supper to be brought, herself unpacked their things,\\nand herself helped to make the beds, and did not even forget to\\nsprinkle them with Persian powder. She showed that alertness, that\\nswiftness of reflection which comes out in men before a battle, in\\nconflict, in the dangerous and decisive moments of life—those moments\\nwhen a man shows once and for all his value, and that all his past has\\nnot been wasted but has been a preparation for these moments.\\n\\nEverything went rapidly in her hands, and before it was twelve o’clock\\nall their things were arranged cleanly and tidily in her rooms, in such\\na way that the hotel rooms seemed like home: the beds were made,\\nbrushes, combs, looking-glasses were put out, table napkins were\\nspread.\\n\\nLevin felt that it was unpardonable to eat, to sleep, to talk even now,\\nand it seemed to him that every movement he made was unseemly. She\\narranged the brushes, but she did it all so that there was nothing\\nshocking in it.\\n\\nThey could neither of them eat, however, and for a long while they\\ncould not sleep, and did not even go to bed.\\n\\n“I am very glad I persuaded him to receive extreme unction tomorrow,”\\nshe said, sitting in her dressing jacket before her folding\\nlooking-glass, combing her soft, fragrant hair with a fine comb. “I\\nhave never seen it, but I know, mamma has told me, there are prayers\\nsaid for recovery.”\\n\\n“Do you suppose he can possibly recover?” said Levin, watching a\\nslender tress at the back of her round little head that was continually\\nhidden when she passed the comb through the front.\\n\\n“I asked the doctor; he said he couldn’t live more than three days. But\\ncan they be sure? I’m very glad, anyway, that I persuaded him,” she\\nsaid, looking askance at her husband through her hair. “Anything is\\npossible,” she added with that peculiar, rather sly expression that was\\nalways in her face when she spoke of religion.\\n\\nSince their conversation about religion when they were engaged neither\\nof them had ever started a discussion of the subject, but she performed\\nall the ceremonies of going to church, saying her prayers, and so on,\\nalways with the unvarying conviction that this ought to be so. In spite\\nof his assertion to the contrary, she was firmly persuaded that he was\\nas much a Christian as she, and indeed a far better one; and all that\\nhe said about it was simply one of his absurd masculine freaks, just as\\nhe would say about her _broderie anglaise_ that good people patch\\nholes, but that she cut them on purpose, and so on.\\n\\n“Yes, you see this woman, Marya Nikolaevna, did not know how to manage\\nall this,” said Levin. “And ... I must own I’m very, very glad you\\ncame. You are such purity that....” He took her hand and did not kiss\\nit (to kiss her hand in such closeness to death seemed to him\\nimproper); he merely squeezed it with a penitent air, looking at her\\nbrightening eyes.\\n\\n“It would have been miserable for you to be alone,” she said, and\\nlifting her hands which hid her cheeks flushing with pleasure, twisted\\nher coil of hair on the nape of her neck and pinned it there. “No,” she\\nwent on, “she did not know how.... Luckily, I learned a lot at Soden.”\\n\\n“Surely there are not people there so ill?”\\n\\n“Worse.”\\n\\n“What’s so awful to me is that I can’t see him as he was when he was\\nyoung. You would not believe how charming he was as a youth, but I did\\nnot understand him then.”\\n\\n“I can quite, quite believe it. How I feel that we might have been\\nfriends!” she said; and, distressed at what she had said, she looked\\nround at her husband, and tears came into her eyes.\\n\\n“Yes, _might have been_,” he said mournfully. “He’s just one of those\\npeople of whom they say they’re not for this world.”\\n\\n“But we have many days before us; we must go to bed,” said Kitty,\\nglancing at her tiny watch 20\\n\\nThe next day the sick man received the sacrament and extreme unction.\\nDuring the ceremony Nikolay Levin prayed fervently. His great eyes,\\nfastened on the holy image that was set out on a card-table covered\\nwith a colored napkin, expressed such passionate prayer and hope that\\nit was awful to Levin to see it. Levin knew that this passionate prayer\\nand hope would only make him feel more bitterly parting from the life\\nhe so loved. Levin knew his brother and the workings of his intellect:\\nhe knew that his unbelief came not from life being easier for him\\nwithout faith, but had grown up because step by step the contemporary\\nscientific interpretation of natural phenomena crushed out the\\npossibility of faith; and so he knew that his present return was not a\\nlegitimate one, brought about by way of the same working of his\\nintellect, but simply a temporary, interested return to faith in a\\ndesperate hope of recovery. Levin knew too that Kitty had strengthened\\nhis hope by accounts of the marvelous recoveries she had heard of.\\nLevin knew all this; and it was agonizingly painful to him to behold\\nthe supplicating, hopeful eyes and the emaciated wrist, lifted with\\ndifficulty, making the sign of the cross on the tense brow, and the\\nprominent shoulders and hollow, gasping chest, which one could not feel\\nconsistent with the life the sick man was praying for. During the\\nsacrament Levin did what he, an unbeliever, had done a thousand times.\\nHe said, addressing God, “If Thou dost exist, make this man to recover”\\n(of course this same thing has been repeated many times), “and Thou\\nwilt save him and me.”\\n\\nAfter extreme unction the sick man became suddenly much better. He did\\nnot cough once in the course of an hour, smiled, kissed Kitty’s hand,\\nthanking her with tears, and said he was comfortable, free from pain,\\nand that he felt strong and had an appetite. He even raised himself\\nwhen his soup was brought, and asked for a cutlet as well. Hopelessly\\nill as he was, obvious as it was at the first glance that he could not\\nrecover, Levin and Kitty were for that hour both in the same state of\\nexcitement, happy, though fearful of being mistaken.\\n\\n“Is he better?”\\n\\n“Yes, much.”\\n\\n“It’s wonderful.”\\n\\n“There’s nothing wonderful in it.”\\n\\n“Anyway, he’s better,” they said in a whisper, smiling to one another.\\n\\nThis self-deception was not of long duration. The sick man fell into a\\nquiet sleep, but he was waked up half an hour later by his cough. And\\nall at once every hope vanished in those about him and in himself. The\\nreality of his suffering crushed all hopes in Levin and Kitty and in\\nthe sick man himself, leaving no doubt, no memory even of past hopes.\\n\\nWithout referring to what he had believed in half an hour before, as\\nthough ashamed even to recall it, he asked for iodine to inhale in a\\nbottle covered with perforated paper. Levin gave him the bottle, and\\nthe same look of passionate hope with which he had taken the sacrament\\nwas now fastened on his brother, demanding from him the confirmation of\\nthe doctor’s words that inhaling iodine worked wonders.\\n\\n“Is Katya not here?” he gasped, looking round while Levin reluctantly\\nassented to the doctor’s words. “No; so I can say it.... It was for her\\nsake I went through that farce. She’s so sweet; but you and I can’t\\ndeceive ourselves. This is what I believe in,” he said, and, squeezing\\nthe bottle in his bony hand, he began breathing over it.\\n\\nAt eight o’clock in the evening Levin and his wife were drinking tea in\\ntheir room when Marya Nikolaevna ran in to them breathlessly. She was\\npale, and her lips were quivering. “He is dying!” she whispered. “I’m\\nafraid will die this minute.”\\n\\nBoth of them ran to him. He was sitting raised up with one elbow on the\\nbed, his long back bent, and his head hanging low.\\n\\n“How do you feel?” Levin asked in a whisper, after a silence.\\n\\n“I feel I’m setting off,” Nikolay said with difficulty, but with\\nextreme distinctness, screwing the words out of himself. He did not\\nraise his head, but simply turned his eyes upwards, without their\\nreaching his brother’s face. “Katya, go away!” he added.\\n\\nLevin jumped up, and with a peremptory whisper made her go out.\\n\\n“I’m setting off,” he said again.\\n\\n“Why do you think so?” said Levin, so as to say something.\\n\\n“Because I’m setting off,” he repeated, as though he had a liking for\\nthe phrase. “It’s the end.”\\n\\nMarya Nikolaevna went up to him.\\n\\n“You had better lie down; you’d be easier,” she said.\\n\\n“I shall lie down soon enough,” he pronounced slowly, “when I’m dead,”\\nhe said sarcastically, wrathfully. “Well, you can lay me down if you\\nlike.”\\n\\nLevin laid his brother on his back, sat down beside him, and gazed at\\nhis face, holding his breath. The dying man lay with closed eyes, but\\nthe muscles twitched from time to time on his forehead, as with one\\nthinking deeply and intensely. Levin involuntarily thought with him of\\nwhat it was that was happening to him now, but in spite of all his\\nmental efforts to go along with him he saw by the expression of that\\ncalm, stern face that for the dying man all was growing clearer and\\nclearer that was still as dark as ever for Levin.\\n\\n“Yes, yes, so,” the dying man articulated slowly at intervals. “Wait a\\nlittle.” He was silent. “Right!” he pronounced all at once\\nreassuringly, as though all were solved for him. “O Lord!” he murmured,\\nand sighed deeply.\\n\\nMarya Nikolaevna felt his feet. “They’re getting cold,” she whispered.\\n\\nFor a long while, a very long while it seemed to Levin, the sick man\\nlay motionless. But he was still alive, and from time to time he\\nsighed. Levin by now was exhausted from mental strain. He felt that,\\nwith no mental effort, could he understand what it was that was\\n_right_. He could not even think of the problem of death itself, but\\nwith no will of his own thoughts kept coming to him of what he had to\\ndo next; closing the dead man’s eyes, dressing him, ordering the\\ncoffin. And, strange to say, he felt utterly cold, and was not\\nconscious of sorrow nor of loss, less still of pity for his brother. If\\nhe had any feeling for his brother at that moment, it was envy for the\\nknowledge the dying man had now that he could not have.\\n\\nA long time more he sat over him so, continually expecting the end. But\\nthe end did not come. The door opened and Kitty appeared. Levin got up\\nto stop her. But at the moment he was getting up, he caught the sound\\nof the dying man stirring.\\n\\n“Don’t go away,” said Nikolay and held out his hand. Levin gave him\\nhis, and angrily waved to his wife to go away.\\n\\nWith the dying man’s hand in his hand, he sat for half an hour, an\\nhour, another hour. He did not think of death at all now. He wondered\\nwhat Kitty was doing; who lived in the next room; whether the doctor\\nlived in a house of his own. He longed for food and for sleep. He\\ncautiously drew away his hand and felt the feet. The feet were cold,\\nbut the sick man was still breathing. Levin tried again to move away on\\ntiptoe, but the sick man stirred again and said: “Don’t go.”\\n\\nThe dawn came; the sick man’s condition was unchanged. Levin stealthily\\nwithdrew his hand, and without looking at the dying man, went off to\\nhis own room and went to sleep. When he woke up, instead of news of his\\nbrother’s death which he expected, he learned that the sick man had\\nreturned to his earlier condition. He had begun sitting up again,\\ncoughing, had begun eating again, talking again, and again had ceased\\nto talk of death, again had begun to express hope of his recovery, and\\nhad become more irritable and more gloomy than ever. No one, neither\\nhis brother nor Kitty, could soothe him. He was angry with everyone,\\nand said nasty things to everyone, reproached everyone for his\\nsufferings, and insisted that they should get him a celebrated doctor\\nfrom Moscow. To all inquiries made him as to how he felt, he made the\\nsame answer with an expression of vindictive reproachfulness, “I’m\\nsuffering horribly, intolerably!”\\n\\nThe sick man was suffering more and more, especially from bedsores,\\nwhich it was impossible now to remedy, and grew more and more angry\\nwith everyone about him, blaming them for everything, and especially\\nfor not having brought him a doctor from Moscow. Kitty tried in every\\npossible way to relieve him, to soothe him; but it was all in vain, and\\nLevin saw that she herself was exhausted both physically and morally,\\nthough she would not admit it. The sense of death, which had been\\nevoked in all by his taking leave of life on the night when he had sent\\nfor his brother, was broken up. Everyone knew that he must inevitably\\ndie soon, that he was half dead already. Everyone wished for nothing\\nbut that he should die as soon as possible, and everyone, concealing\\nthis, gave him medicines, tried to find remedies and doctors, and\\ndeceived him and themselves and each other. All this was falsehood,\\ndisgusting, irreverent deceit. And owing to the bent of his character,\\nand because he loved the dying man more than anyone else did, Levin was\\nmost painfully conscious of this deceit.\\n\\nLevin, who had long been possessed by the idea of reconciling his\\nbrothers, at least in face of death, had written to his brother, Sergey\\nIvanovitch, and having received an answer from him, he read this letter\\nto the sick man. Sergey Ivanovitch wrote that he could not come\\nhimself, and in touching terms he begged his brother’s forgiveness.\\n\\nThe sick man said nothing.\\n\\n“What am I to write to him?” said Levin. “I hope you are not angry with\\nhim?”\\n\\n“No, not the least!” Nikolay answered, vexed at the question. “Tell him\\nto send me a doctor.”\\n\\nThree more days of agony followed; the sick man was still in the same\\ncondition. The sense of longing for his death was felt by everyone now\\nat the mere sight of him, by the waiters and the hotel-keeper and all\\nthe people staying in the hotel, and the doctor and Marya Nikolaevna\\nand Levin and Kitty. The sick man alone did not express this feeling,\\nbut on the contrary was furious at their not getting him doctors, and\\nwent on taking medicine and talking of life. Only at rare moments, when\\nthe opium gave him an instant’s relief from the never-ceasing pain, he\\nwould sometimes, half asleep, utter what was ever more intense in his\\nheart than in all the others: “Oh, if it were only the end!” or: “When\\nwill it be over?”\\n\\nHis sufferings, steadily growing more intense, did their work and\\nprepared him for death. There was no position in which he was not in\\npain, there was not a minute in which he was unconscious of it, not a\\nlimb, not a part of his body that did not ache and cause him agony.\\nEven the memories, the impressions, the thoughts of this body awakened\\nin him now the same aversion as the body itself. The sight of other\\npeople, their remarks, his own reminiscences, everything was for him a\\nsource of agony. Those about him felt this, and instinctively did not\\nallow themselves to move freely, to talk, to express their wishes\\nbefore him. All his life was merged in the one feeling of suffering and\\ndesire to be rid of it.\\n\\nThere was evidently coming over him that revulsion that would make him\\nlook upon death as the goal of his desires, as happiness. Hitherto each\\nindividual desire, aroused by suffering or privation, such as hunger,\\nfatigue, thirst, had been satisfied by some bodily function giving\\npleasure. But now no physical craving or suffering received relief, and\\nthe effort to relieve them only caused fresh suffering. And so all\\ndesires were merged in one—the desire to be rid of all his sufferings\\nand their source, the body. But he had no words to express this desire\\nof deliverance, and so he did not speak of it, and from habit asked for\\nthe satisfaction of desires which could not now be satisfied. “Turn me\\nover on the other side,” he would say, and immediately after he would\\nask to be turned back again as before. “Give me some broth. Take away\\nthe broth. Talk of something: why are you silent?” And directly they\\nbegan to talk he would close his eyes, and would show weariness,\\nindifference, and loathing.\\n\\nOn the tenth day from their arrival at the town, Kitty was unwell. She\\nsuffered from headache and sickness, and she could not get up all the\\nmorning.\\n\\nThe doctor opined that the indisposition arose from fatigue and\\nexcitement, and prescribed rest.\\n\\nAfter dinner, however, Kitty got up and went as usual with her work to\\nthe sick man. He looked at her sternly when she came in, and smiled\\ncontemptuously when she said she had been unwell. That day he was\\ncontinually blowing his nose, and groaning piteously.\\n\\n“How do you feel?” she asked him.\\n\\n“Worse,” he articulated with difficulty. “In pain!”\\n\\n“In pain, where?”\\n\\n“Everywhere.”\\n\\n“It will be over today, you will see,” said Marya Nikolaevna. Though it\\nwas said in a whisper, the sick man, whose hearing Levin had noticed\\nwas very keen, must have heard. Levin said hush to her, and looked\\nround at the sick man. Nikolay had heard; but these words produced no\\neffect on him. His eyes had still the same intense, reproachful look.\\n\\n“Why do you think so?” Levin asked her, when she had followed him into\\nthe corridor.\\n\\n“He has begun picking at himself,” said Marya Nikolaevna.\\n\\n“How do you mean?”\\n\\n“Like this,” she said, tugging at the folds of her woolen skirt. Levin\\nnoticed, indeed, that all that day the patient pulled at himself, as it\\nwere, trying to snatch something away.\\n\\nMarya Nikolaevna’s prediction came true. Towards night the sick man was\\nnot able to lift his hands, and could only gaze before him with the\\nsame intensely concentrated expression in his eyes. Even when his\\nbrother or Kitty bent over him, so that he could see them, he looked\\njust the same. Kitty sent for the priest to read the prayer for the\\ndying.\\n\\nWhile the priest was reading it, the dying man did not show any sign of\\nlife; his eyes were closed. Levin, Kitty, and Marya Nikolaevna stood at\\nthe bedside. The priest had not quite finished reading the prayer when\\nthe dying man stretched, sighed, and opened his eyes. The priest, on\\nfinishing the prayer, put the cross to the cold forehead, then slowly\\nreturned it to the stand, and after standing for two minutes more in\\nsilence, he touched the huge, bloodless hand that was turning cold.\\n\\n“He is gone,” said the priest, and would have moved away; but suddenly\\nthere was a faint stir in the mustaches of the dead man that seemed\\nglued together, and quite distinctly in the hush they heard from the\\nbottom of the chest the sharply defined sounds:\\n\\n“Not quite ... soon.”\\n\\nAnd a minute later the face brightened, a smile came out under the\\nmustaches, and the women who had gathered round began carefully laying\\nout the corpse.\\n\\nThe sight of his brother, and the nearness of death, revived in Levin\\nthat sense of horror in face of the insoluble enigma, together with the\\nnearness and inevitability of death, that had come upon him that autumn\\nevening when his brother had come to him. This feeling was now even\\nstronger than before; even less than before did he feel capable of\\napprehending the meaning of death, and its inevitability rose up before\\nhim more terrible than ever. But now, thanks to his wife’s presence,\\nthat feeling did not reduce him to despair. In spite of death, he felt\\nthe need of life and love. He felt that love saved him from despair,\\nand that this love, under the menace of despair, had become still\\nstronger and purer. The one mystery of death, still unsolved, had\\nscarcely passed before his eyes, when another mystery had arisen, as\\ninsoluble, urging him to love and to life.\\n\\nThe doctor confirmed his suppositions in regard to Kitty. Her\\nindisposition was a symptom that she was with child 21\\n\\nFrom the moment when Alexey Alexandrovitch understood from his\\ninterviews with Betsy and with Stepan Arkadyevitch that all that was\\nexpected of him was to leave his wife in peace, without burdening her\\nwith his presence, and that his wife herself desired this, he felt so\\ndistraught that he could come to no decision of himself; he did not\\nknow himself what he wanted now, and putting himself in the hands of\\nthose who were so pleased to interest themselves in his affairs, he met\\neverything with unqualified assent. It was only when Anna had left his\\nhouse, and the English governess sent to ask him whether she should\\ndine with him or separately, that for the first time he clearly\\ncomprehended his position, and was appalled by it. Most difficult of\\nall in this position was the fact that he could not in any way connect\\nand reconcile his past with what was now. It was not the past when he\\nhad lived happily with his wife that troubled him. The transition from\\nthat past to a knowledge of his wife’s unfaithfulness he had lived\\nthrough miserably already; that state was painful, but he could\\nunderstand it. If his wife had then, on declaring to him her\\nunfaithfulness, left him, he would have been wounded, unhappy, but he\\nwould not have been in the hopeless position—incomprehensible to\\nhimself—in which he felt himself now. He could not now reconcile his\\nimmediate past, his tenderness, his love for his sick wife, and for the\\nother man’s child with what was now the case, that is with the fact\\nthat, as it were, in return for all this he now found himself alone,\\nput to shame, a laughing-stock, needed by no one, and despised by\\neveryone.\\n\\nFor the first two days after his wife’s departure Alexey Alexandrovitch\\nreceived applicants for assistance and his chief secretary, drove to\\nthe committee, and went down to dinner in the dining-room as usual.\\nWithout giving himself a reason for what he was doing, he strained\\nevery nerve of his being for those two days, simply to preserve an\\nappearance of composure, and even of indifference. Answering inquiries\\nabout the disposition of Anna Arkadyevna’s rooms and belongings, he had\\nexercised immense self-control to appear like a man in whose eyes what\\nhad occurred was not unforeseen nor out of the ordinary course of\\nevents, and he attained his aim: no one could have detected in him\\nsigns of despair. But on the second day after her departure, when\\nKorney gave him a bill from a fashionable draper’s shop, which Anna had\\nforgotten to pay, and announced that the clerk from the shop was\\nwaiting, Alexey Alexandrovitch told him to show the clerk up.\\n\\n“Excuse me, your excellency, for venturing to trouble you. But if you\\ndirect us to apply to her excellency, would you graciously oblige us\\nwith her address?”\\n\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch pondered, as it seemed to the clerk, and all at\\nonce, turning round, he sat down at the table. Letting his head sink\\ninto his hands, he sat for a long while in that position, several times\\nattempted to speak and stopped short. Korney, perceiving his master’s\\nemotion, asked the clerk to call another time. Left alone, Alexey\\nAlexandrovitch recognized that he had not the strength to keep up the\\nline of firmness and composure any longer. He gave orders for the\\ncarriage that was awaiting him to be taken back, and for no one to be\\nadmitted, and he did not go down to dinner.\\n\\nHe felt that he could not endure the weight of universal contempt and\\nexasperation, which he had distinctly seen in the face of the clerk and\\nof Korney, and of everyone, without exception, whom he had met during\\nthose two days. He felt that he could not turn aside from himself the\\nhatred of men, because that hatred did not come from his being bad (in\\nthat case he could have tried to be better), but from his being\\nshamefully and repulsively unhappy. He knew that for this, for the very\\nfact that his heart was torn with grief, they would be merciless to\\nhim. He felt that men would crush him as dogs strangle a torn dog\\nyelping with pain. He knew that his sole means of security against\\npeople was to hide his wounds from them, and instinctively he tried to\\ndo this for two days, but now he felt incapable of keeping up the\\nunequal struggle.\\n\\nHis despair was even intensified by the consciousness that he was\\nutterly alone in his sorrow. In all Petersburg there was not a human\\nbeing to whom he could express what he was feeling, who would feel for\\nhim, not as a high official, not as a member of society, but simply as\\na suffering man; indeed he had not such a one in the whole world.\\n\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch grew up an orphan. There were two brothers. They\\ndid not remember their father, and their mother died when Alexey\\nAlexandrovitch was ten years old. The property was a small one. Their\\nuncle, Karenin, a government official of high standing, at one time a\\nfavorite of the late Tsar, had brought them up.\\n\\nOn completing his high school and university courses with medals,\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch had, with his uncle’s aid, immediately started in\\na prominent position in the service, and from that time forward he had\\ndevoted himself exclusively to political ambition. In the high school\\nand the university, and afterwards in the service, Alexey\\nAlexandrovitch had never formed a close friendship with anyone. His\\nbrother had been the person nearest to his heart, but he had a post in\\nthe Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and was always abroad, where he had\\ndied shortly after Alexey Alexandrovitch’s marriage.\\n\\nWhile he was governor of a province, Anna’s aunt, a wealthy provincial\\nlady, had thrown him—middle-aged as he was, though young for a\\ngovernor—with her niece, and had succeeded in putting him in such a\\nposition that he had either to declare himself or to leave the town.\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch was not long in hesitation. There were at the\\ntime as many reasons for the step as against it, and there was no\\noverbalancing consideration to outweigh his invariable rule of\\nabstaining when in doubt. But Anna’s aunt had through a common\\nacquaintance insinuated that he had already compromised the girl, and\\nthat he was in honor bound to make her an offer. He made the offer, and\\nconcentrated on his betrothed and his wife all the feeling of which he\\nwas capable.\\n\\nThe attachment he felt to Anna precluded in his heart every need of\\nintimate relations with others. And now among all his acquaintances he\\nhad not one friend. He had plenty of so-called connections, but no\\nfriendships. Alexey Alexandrovitch had plenty of people whom he could\\ninvite to dinner, to whose sympathy he could appeal in any public\\naffair he was concerned about, whose interest he could reckon upon for\\nanyone he wished to help, with whom he could candidly discuss other\\npeople’s business and affairs of state. But his relations with these\\npeople were confined to one clearly defined channel, and had a certain\\nroutine from which it was impossible to depart. There was one man, a\\ncomrade of his at the university, with whom he had made friends later,\\nand with whom he could have spoken of a personal sorrow; but this\\nfriend had a post in the Department of Education in a remote part of\\nRussia. Of the people in Petersburg the most intimate and most possible\\nwere his chief secretary and his doctor.\\n\\nMihail Vassilievitch Sludin, the chief secretary, was a\\nstraightforward, intelligent, good-hearted, and conscientious man, and\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch was aware of his personal goodwill. But their\\nfive years of official work together seemed to have put a barrier\\nbetween them that cut off warmer relations.\\n\\nAfter signing the papers brought him, Alexey Alexandrovitch had sat for\\na long while in silence, glancing at Mihail Vassilievitch, and several\\ntimes he attempted to speak, but could not. He had already prepared the\\nphrase: “You have heard of my trouble?” But he ended by saying, as\\nusual: “So you’ll get this ready for me?” and with that dismissed him.\\n\\nThe other person was the doctor, who had also a kindly feeling for him;\\nbut there had long existed a taciturn understanding between them that\\nboth were weighed down by work, and always in a hurry.\\n\\nOf his women friends, foremost amongst them Countess Lidia Ivanovna,\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch never thought. All women, simply as women, were\\nterrible and distasteful to him 22\\n\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch had forgotten the Countess Lidia Ivanovna, but\\nshe had not forgotten him. At the bitterest moment of his lonely\\ndespair she came to him, and without waiting to be announced, walked\\nstraight into his study. She found him as he was sitting with his head\\nin both hands.\\n\\n“_J’ai forcé la consigne_,” she said, walking in with rapid steps and\\nbreathing hard with excitement and rapid exercise. “I have heard all!\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch! Dear friend!” she went on, warmly squeezing his\\nhand in both of hers and gazing with her fine pensive eyes into his.\\n\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch, frowning, got up, and disengaging his hand,\\nmoved her a chair.\\n\\n“Won’t you sit down, countess? I’m seeing no one because I’m unwell,\\ncountess,” he said, and his lips twitched.\\n\\n“Dear friend!” repeated Countess Lidia Ivanovna, never taking her eyes\\noff his, and suddenly her eyebrows rose at the inner corners,\\ndescribing a triangle on her forehead, her ugly yellow face became\\nstill uglier, but Alexey Alexandrovitch felt that she was sorry for him\\nand was preparing to cry. And he too was softened; he snatched her\\nplump hand and proceeded to kiss it.\\n\\n“Dear friend!” she said in a voice breaking with emotion. “You ought\\nnot to give way to grief. Your sorrow is a great one, but you ought to\\nfind consolation.”\\n\\n“I am crushed, I am annihilated, I am no longer a man!” said Alexey\\nAlexandrovitch, letting go her hand, but still gazing into her brimming\\neyes. “My position is so awful because I can find nowhere, I cannot\\nfind within me strength to support me.”\\n\\n“You will find support; seek it—not in me, though I beseech you to\\nbelieve in my friendship,” she said, with a sigh. “Our support is love,\\nthat love that He has vouchsafed us. His burden is light,” she said,\\nwith the look of ecstasy Alexey Alexandrovitch knew so well. “He will\\nbe your support and your succor.”\\n\\nAlthough there was in these words a flavor of that sentimental emotion\\nat her own lofty feelings, and that new mystical fervor which had\\nlately gained ground in Petersburg, and which seemed to Alexey\\nAlexandrovitch disproportionate, still it was pleasant to him to hear\\nthis now.\\n\\n“I am weak. I am crushed. I foresaw nothing, and now I understand\\nnothing.”\\n\\n“Dear friend,” repeated Lidia Ivanovna.\\n\\n“It’s not the loss of what I have not now, it’s not that!” pursued\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch. “I do not grieve for that. But I cannot help\\nfeeling humiliated before other people for the position I am placed in.\\nIt is wrong, but I can’t help it, I can’t help it.”\\n\\n“Not you it was performed that noble act of forgiveness, at which I was\\nmoved to ecstasy, and everyone else too, but He, working within your\\nheart,” said Countess Lidia Ivanovna, raising her eyes rapturously,\\n“and so you cannot be ashamed of your act.”\\n\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch knitted his brows, and crooking his hands, he\\ncracked his fingers.\\n\\n“One must know all the facts,” he said in his thin voice. “A man’s\\nstrength has its limits, countess, and I have reached my limits. The\\nwhole day I have had to be making arrangements, arrangements about\\nhousehold matters arising” (he emphasized the word _arising_) “from my\\nnew, solitary position. The servants, the governess, the accounts....\\nThese pinpricks have stabbed me to the heart, and I have not the\\nstrength to bear it. At dinner ... yesterday, I was almost getting up\\nfrom the dinner-table. I could not bear the way my son looked at me. He\\ndid not ask me the meaning of it all, but he wanted to ask, and I could\\nnot bear the look in his eyes. He was afraid to look at me, but that is\\nnot all....” Alexey Alexandrovitch would have referred to the bill that\\nhad been brought him, but his voice shook, and he stopped. That bill on\\nblue paper, for a hat and ribbons, he could not recall without a rush\\nof self-pity.\\n\\n“I understand, dear friend,” said Lidia Ivanovna. “I understand it all.\\nSuccor and comfort you will find not in me, though I have come only to\\naid you if I can. If I could take from off you all these petty,\\nhumiliating cares ... I understand that a woman’s word, a woman’s\\nsuperintendence is needed. You will intrust it to me?”\\n\\nSilently and gratefully Alexey Alexandrovitch pressed her hand.\\n\\n“Together we will take care of Seryozha. Practical affairs are not my\\nstrong point. But I will set to work. I will be your housekeeper. Don’t\\nthank me. I do it not from myself....”\\n\\n“I cannot help thanking you.”\\n\\n“But, dear friend, do not give way to the feeling of which you\\nspoke—being ashamed of what is the Christian’s highest glory: _he who\\nhumbles himself shall be exalted_. And you cannot thank me. You must\\nthank Him, and pray to Him for succor. In Him alone we find peace,\\nconsolation, salvation, and love,” she said, and turning her eyes\\nheavenwards, she began praying, as Alexey Alexandrovitch gathered from\\nher silence.\\n\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch listened to her now, and those expressions which\\nhad seemed to him, if not distasteful, at least exaggerated, now seemed\\nto him natural and consolatory. Alexey Alexandrovitch had disliked this\\nnew enthusiastic fervor. He was a believer, who was interested in\\nreligion primarily in its political aspect, and the new doctrine which\\nventured upon several new interpretations, just because it paved the\\nway to discussion and analysis, was in principle disagreeable to him.\\nHe had hitherto taken up a cold and even antagonistic attitude to this\\nnew doctrine, and with Countess Lidia Ivanovna, who had been carried\\naway by it, he had never argued, but by silence had assiduously parried\\nher attempts to provoke him into argument. Now for the first time he\\nheard her words with pleasure, and did not inwardly oppose them.\\n\\n“I am very, very grateful to you, both for your deeds and for your\\nwords,” he said, when she had finished praying.\\n\\nCountess Lidia Ivanovna once more pressed both her friend’s hands.\\n\\n“Now I will enter upon my duties,” she said with a smile after a pause,\\nas she wiped away the traces of tears. “I am going to Seryozha. Only in\\nthe last extremity shall I apply to you.” And she got up and went out.\\n\\nCountess Lidia Ivanovna went into Seryozha’s part of the house, and\\ndropping tears on the scared child’s cheeks, she told him that his\\nfather was a saint and his mother was dead.\\n\\nCountess Lidia Ivanovna kept her promise. She did actually take upon\\nherself the care of the organization and management of Alexey\\nAlexandrovitch’s household. But she had not overstated the case when\\nsaying that practical affairs were not her strong point. All her\\narrangements had to be modified because they could not be carried out,\\nand they were modified by Korney, Alexey Alexandrovitch’s valet, who,\\nthough no one was aware of the fact, now managed Karenin’s household,\\nand quietly and discreetly reported to his master while he was dressing\\nall it was necessary for him to know. But Lidia Ivanovna’s help was\\nnone the less real; she gave Alexey Alexandrovitch moral support in the\\nconsciousness of her love and respect for him, and still more, as it\\nwas soothing to her to believe, in that she almost turned him to\\nChristianity—that is, from an indifferent and apathetic believer she\\nturned him into an ardent and steadfast adherent of the new\\ninterpretation of Christian doctrine, which had been gaining ground of\\nlate in Petersburg. It was easy for Alexey Alexandrovitch to believe in\\nthis teaching. Alexey Alexandrovitch, like Lidia Ivanovna indeed, and\\nothers who shared their views, was completely devoid of vividness of\\nimagination, that spiritual faculty in virtue of which the conceptions\\nevoked by the imagination become so vivid that they must needs be in\\nharmony with other conceptions, and with actual fact. He saw nothing\\nimpossible and inconceivable in the idea that death, though existing\\nfor unbelievers, did not exist for him, and that, as he was possessed\\nof the most perfect faith, of the measure of which he was himself the\\njudge, therefore there was no sin in his soul, and he was experiencing\\ncomplete salvation here on earth.\\n\\nIt is true that the erroneousness and shallowness of this conception of\\nhis faith was dimly perceptible to Alexey Alexandrovitch, and he knew\\nthat when, without the slightest idea that his forgiveness was the\\naction of a higher power, he had surrendered directly to the feeling of\\nforgiveness, he had felt more happiness than now when he was thinking\\nevery instant that Christ was in his heart, and that in signing\\nofficial papers he was doing His will. But for Alexey Alexandrovitch it\\nwas a necessity to think in that way; it was such a necessity for him\\nin his humiliation to have some elevated standpoint, however imaginary,\\nfrom which, looked down upon by all, he could look down on others, that\\nhe clung, as to his one salvation, to his delusion of salvation 23\\n\\nThe Countess Lidia Ivanovna had, as a very young and sentimental girl,\\nbeen married to a wealthy man of high rank, an extremely good-natured,\\njovial, and extremely dissipated rake. Two months after marriage her\\nhusband abandoned her, and her impassioned protestations of affection\\nhe met with a sarcasm and even hostility that people knowing the\\ncount’s good heart, and seeing no defects in the sentimental Lidia,\\nwere at a loss to explain. Though they were divorced and lived apart,\\nyet whenever the husband met the wife, he invariably behaved to her\\nwith the same malignant irony, the cause of which was incomprehensible.\\n\\nCountess Lidia Ivanovna had long given up being in love with her\\nhusband, but from that time she had never given up being in love with\\nsomeone. She was in love with several people at once, both men and\\nwomen; she had been in love with almost everyone who had been\\nparticularly distinguished in any way. She was in love with all the new\\nprinces and princesses who married into the imperial family; she had\\nbeen in love with a high dignitary of the Church, a vicar, and a parish\\npriest; she had been in love with a journalist, three Slavophiles, with\\nKomissarov, with a minister, a doctor, an English missionary and\\nKarenin. All these passions constantly waning or growing more ardent,\\ndid not prevent her from keeping up the most extended and complicated\\nrelations with the court and fashionable society. But from the time\\nthat after Karenin’s trouble she took him under her special protection,\\nfrom the time that she set to work in Karenin’s household looking after\\nhis welfare, she felt that all her other attachments were not the real\\nthing, and that she was now genuinely in love, and with no one but\\nKarenin. The feeling she now experienced for him seemed to her stronger\\nthan any of her former feelings. Analyzing her feeling, and comparing\\nit with former passions, she distinctly perceived that she would not\\nhave been in love with Komissarov if he had not saved the life of the\\nTsar, that she would not have been in love with Ristitch-Kudzhitsky if\\nthere had been no Slavonic question, but that she loved Karenin for\\nhimself, for his lofty, uncomprehended soul, for the sweet—to her—high\\nnotes of his voice, for his drawling intonation, his weary eyes, his\\ncharacter, and his soft white hands with their swollen veins. She was\\nnot simply overjoyed at meeting him, but she sought in his face signs\\nof the impression she was making on him. She tried to please him, not\\nby her words only, but in her whole person. For his sake it was that\\nshe now lavished more care on her dress than before. She caught herself\\nin reveries on what might have been, if she had not been married and he\\nhad been free. She blushed with emotion when he came into the room, she\\ncould not repress a smile of rapture when he said anything amiable to\\nher.\\n\\nFor several days now Countess Lidia Ivanovna had been in a state of\\nintense excitement. She had learned that Anna and Vronsky were in\\nPetersburg. Alexey Alexandrovitch must be saved from seeing her, he\\nmust be saved even from the torturing knowledge that that awful woman\\nwas in the same town with him, and that he might meet her any minute.\\n\\nLidia Ivanovna made inquiries through her friends as to what those\\n_infamous people_, as she called Anna and Vronsky, intended doing, and\\nshe endeavored so to guide every movement of her friend during those\\ndays that he could not come across them. The young adjutant, an\\nacquaintance of Vronsky, through whom she obtained her information, and\\nwho hoped through Countess Lidia Ivanovna to obtain a concession, told\\nher that they had finished their business and were going away next day.\\nLidia Ivanovna had already begun to calm down, when the next morning a\\nnote was brought her, the handwriting of which she recognized with\\nhorror. It was the handwriting of Anna Karenina. The envelope was of\\npaper as thick as bark; on the oblong yellow paper there was a huge\\nmonogram, and the letter smelt of agreeable scent.\\n\\n“Who brought it?”\\n\\n“A commissionaire from the hotel.”\\n\\nIt was some time before Countess Lidia Ivanovna could sit down to read\\nthe letter. Her excitement brought on an attack of asthma, to which she\\nwas subject. When she had recovered her composure, she read the\\nfollowing letter in French:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Madame la Comtesse,\\n\\n“The Christian feelings with which your heart is filled give me the, I\\nfeel, unpardonable boldness to write to you. I am miserable at being\\nseparated from my son. I entreat permission to see him once before my\\ndeparture. Forgive me for recalling myself to your memory. I apply to\\nyou and not to Alexey Alexandrovitch, simply because I do not wish to\\ncause that generous man to suffer in remembering me. Knowing your\\nfriendship for him, I know you will understand me. Could you send\\nSeryozha to me, or should I come to the house at some fixed hour, or\\nwill you let me know when and where I could see him away from home? I\\ndo not anticipate a refusal, knowing the magnanimity of him with whom\\nit rests. You cannot conceive the craving I have to see him, and so\\ncannot conceive the gratitude your help will arouse in me.\\n\\n“Anna.”\\n\\n\\n\\nEverything in this letter exasperated Countess Lidia Ivanovna: its\\ncontents and the allusion to magnanimity, and especially its free and\\neasy—as she considered—tone.\\n\\n“Say that there is no answer,” said Countess Lidia Ivanovna, and\\nimmediately opening her blotting-book, she wrote to Alexey\\nAlexandrovitch that she hoped to see him at one o’clock at the levee.\\n\\n“I must talk with you of a grave and painful subject. There we will\\narrange where to meet. Best of all at my house, where I will order tea\\n_as you like it_. Urgent. He lays the cross, but He gives the strength\\nto bear it,” she added, so as to give him some slight preparation.\\nCountess Lidia Ivanovna usually wrote some two or three letters a day\\nto Alexey Alexandrovitch. She enjoyed that form of communication, which\\ngave opportunity for a refinement and air of mystery not afforded by\\ntheir personal interviews 24\\n\\nThe levee was drawing to a close. People met as they were going away,\\nand gossiped of the latest news, of the newly bestowed honors and the\\nchanges in the positions of the higher functionaries.\\n\\n“If only Countess Marya Borissovna were Minister of War, and Princess\\nVatkovskaya were Commander-in-Chief,” said a gray-headed, little old\\nman in a gold-embroidered uniform, addressing a tall, handsome maid of\\nhonor who had questioned him about the new appointments.\\n\\n“And me among the adjutants,” said the maid of honor, smiling.\\n\\n“You have an appointment already. You’re over the ecclesiastical\\ndepartment. And your assistant’s Karenin.”\\n\\n“Good-day, prince!” said the little old man to a man who came up to\\nhim.\\n\\n“What were you saying of Karenin?” said the prince.\\n\\n“He and Putyatov have received the Alexander Nevsky.”\\n\\n“I thought he had it already.”\\n\\n“No. Just look at him,” said the little old man, pointing with his\\nembroidered hat to Karenin in a court uniform with the new red ribbon\\nacross his shoulders, standing in the doorway of the hall with an\\ninfluential member of the Imperial Council. “Pleased and happy as a\\nbrass farthing,” he added, stopping to shake hands with a handsome\\ngentleman of the bedchamber of colossal proportions.\\n\\n“No; he’s looking older,” said the gentleman of the bedchamber.\\n\\n“From overwork. He’s always drawing up projects nowadays. He won’t let\\na poor devil go nowadays till he’s explained it all to him under\\nheads.”\\n\\n“Looking older, did you say? _Il fait des passions_. I believe Countess\\nLidia Ivanovna’s jealous now of his wife.”\\n\\n“Oh, come now, please don’t say any harm of Countess Lidia Ivanovna.”\\n\\n“Why, is there any harm in her being in love with Karenin?”\\n\\n“But is it true Madame Karenina’s here?”\\n\\n“Well, not here in the palace, but in Petersburg. I met her yesterday\\nwith Alexey Vronsky, _bras dessous, bras dessous_, in the Morsky.”\\n\\n“_C’est un homme qui n’a pas_,...” the gentleman of the bedchamber was\\nbeginning, but he stopped to make room, bowing, for a member of the\\nImperial family to pass.\\n\\nThus people talked incessantly of Alexey Alexandrovitch, finding fault\\nwith him and laughing at him, while he, blocking up the way of the\\nmember of the Imperial Council he had captured, was explaining to him\\npoint by point his new financial project, never interrupting his\\ndiscourse for an instant for fear he should escape.\\n\\nAlmost at the same time that his wife left Alexey Alexandrovitch there\\nhad come to him that bitterest moment in the life of an official—the\\nmoment when his upward career comes to a full stop. This full stop had\\narrived and everyone perceived it, but Alexey Alexandrovitch himself\\nwas not yet aware that his career was over. Whether it was due to his\\nfeud with Stremov, or his misfortune with his wife, or simply that\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch had reached his destined limits, it had become\\nevident to everyone in the course of that year that his career was at\\nan end. He still filled a position of consequence, he sat on many\\ncommissions and committees, but he was a man whose day was over, and\\nfrom whom nothing was expected. Whatever he said, whatever he proposed,\\nwas heard as though it were something long familiar, and the very thing\\nthat was not needed. But Alexey Alexandrovitch was not aware of this,\\nand, on the contrary, being cut off from direct participation in\\ngovernmental activity, he saw more clearly than ever the errors and\\ndefects in the action of others, and thought it his duty to point out\\nmeans for their correction. Shortly after his separation from his wife,\\nhe began writing his first note on the new judicial procedure, the\\nfirst of the endless series of notes he was destined to write in the\\nfuture.\\n\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch did not merely fail to observe his hopeless\\nposition in the official world, he was not merely free from anxiety on\\nthis head, he was positively more satisfied than ever with his own\\nactivity.\\n\\n“He that is unmarried careth for the things that belong to the Lord,\\nhow he may please the Lord: but he that is married careth for the\\nthings that are of the world, how he may please his wife,” says the\\nApostle Paul, and Alexey Alexandrovitch, who was now guided in every\\naction by Scripture, often recalled this text. It seemed to him that\\never since he had been left without a wife, he had in these very\\nprojects of reform been serving the Lord more zealously than before.\\n\\nThe unmistakable impatience of the member of the Council trying to get\\naway from him did not trouble Alexey Alexandrovitch; he gave up his\\nexposition only when the member of the Council, seizing his chance when\\none of the Imperial family was passing, slipped away from him.\\n\\nLeft alone, Alexey Alexandrovitch looked down, collecting his thoughts,\\nthen looked casually about him and walked towards the door, where he\\nhoped to meet Countess Lidia Ivanovna.\\n\\n“And how strong they all are, how sound physically,” thought Alexey\\nAlexandrovitch, looking at the powerfully built gentleman of the\\nbedchamber with his well-combed, perfumed whiskers, and at the red neck\\nof the prince, pinched by his tight uniform. He had to pass them on his\\nway. “Truly is it said that all the world is evil,” he thought, with\\nanother sidelong glance at the calves of the gentleman of the\\nbedchamber.\\n\\nMoving forward deliberately, Alexey Alexandrovitch bowed with his\\ncustomary air of weariness and dignity to the gentleman who had been\\ntalking about him, and looking towards the door, his eyes sought\\nCountess Lidia Ivanovna.\\n\\n“Ah! Alexey Alexandrovitch!” said the little old man, with a malicious\\nlight in his eyes, at the moment when Karenin was on a level with them,\\nand was nodding with a frigid gesture, “I haven’t congratulated you\\nyet,” said the old man, pointing to his newly received ribbon.\\n\\n“Thank you,” answered Alexey Alexandrovitch. “What an _exquisite_ day\\ntoday,” he added, laying emphasis in his peculiar way on the word\\n_exquisite_.\\n\\nThat they laughed at him he was well aware, but he did not expect\\nanything but hostility from them; he was used to that by now.\\n\\nCatching sight of the yellow shoulders of Lidia Ivanovna jutting out\\nabove her corset, and her fine pensive eyes bidding him to her, Alexey\\nAlexandrovitch smiled, revealing untarnished white teeth, and went\\ntowards her.\\n\\nLidia Ivanovna’s dress had cost her great pains, as indeed all her\\ndresses had done of late. Her aim in dress was now quite the reverse of\\nthat she had pursued thirty years before. Then her desire had been to\\nadorn herself with something, and the more adorned the better. Now, on\\nthe contrary, she was perforce decked out in a way so inconsistent with\\nher age and her figure, that her one anxiety was to contrive that the\\ncontrast between these adornments and her own exterior should not be\\ntoo appalling. And as far as Alexey Alexandrovitch was concerned she\\nsucceeded, and was in his eyes attractive. For him she was the one\\nisland not only of goodwill to him, but of love in the midst of the sea\\nof hostility and jeering that surrounded him.\\n\\nPassing through rows of ironical eyes, he was drawn as naturally to her\\nloving glance as a plant to the sun.\\n\\n“I congratulate you,” she said to him, her eyes on his ribbon.\\n\\nSuppressing a smile of pleasure, he shrugged his shoulders, closing his\\neyes, as though to say that that could not be a source of joy to him.\\nCountess Lidia Ivanovna was very well aware that it was one of his\\nchief sources of satisfaction, though he never admitted it.\\n\\n“How is our angel?” said Countess Lidia Ivanovna, meaning Seryozha.\\n\\n“I can’t say I was quite pleased with him,” said Alexey Alexandrovitch,\\nraising his eyebrows and opening his eyes. “And Sitnikov is not\\nsatisfied with him.” (Sitnikov was the tutor to whom Seryozha’s secular\\neducation had been intrusted.) “As I have mentioned to you, there’s a\\nsort of coldness in him towards the most important questions which\\nought to touch the heart of every man and every child....” Alexey\\nAlexandrovitch began expounding his views on the sole question that\\ninterested him besides the service—the education of his son.\\n\\nWhen Alexey Alexandrovitch with Lidia Ivanovna’s help had been brought\\nback anew to life and activity, he felt it his duty to undertake the\\neducation of the son left on his hands. Having never before taken any\\ninterest in educational questions, Alexey Alexandrovitch devoted some\\ntime to the theoretical study of the subject. After reading several\\nbooks on anthropology, education, and didactics, Alexey Alexandrovitch\\ndrew up a plan of education, and engaging the best tutor in Petersburg\\nto superintend it, he set to work, and the subject continually absorbed\\nhim.\\n\\n“Yes, but the heart. I see in him his father’s heart, and with such a\\nheart a child cannot go far wrong,” said Lidia Ivanovna with\\nenthusiasm.\\n\\n“Yes, perhaps.... As for me, I do my duty. It’s all I can do.”\\n\\n“You’re coming to me,” said Countess Lidia Ivanovna, after a pause; “we\\nhave to speak of a subject painful for you. I would give anything to\\nhave spared you certain memories, but others are not of the same mind.\\nI have received a letter from _her_. _She_ is here in Petersburg.”\\n\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch shuddered at the allusion to his wife, but\\nimmediately his face assumed the deathlike rigidity which expressed\\nutter helplessness in the matter.\\n\\n“I was expecting it,” he said.\\n\\nCountess Lidia Ivanovna looked at him ecstatically, and tears of\\nrapture at the greatness of his soul came into her eyes 25\\n\\nWhen Alexey Alexandrovitch came into the Countess Lidia Ivanovna’s snug\\nlittle boudoir, decorated with old china and hung with portraits, the\\nlady herself had not yet made her appearance.\\n\\nShe was changing her dress.\\n\\nA cloth was laid on a round table, and on it stood a china tea service\\nand a silver spirit-lamp and tea kettle. Alexey Alexandrovitch looked\\nidly about at the endless familiar portraits which adorned the room,\\nand sitting down to the table, he opened a New Testament lying upon it.\\nThe rustle of the countess’s silk skirt drew his attention off.\\n\\n“Well now, we can sit quietly,” said Countess Lidia Ivanovna, slipping\\nhurriedly with an agitated smile between the table and the sofa, “and\\ntalk over our tea.”\\n\\nAfter some words of preparation, Countess Lidia Ivanovna, breathing\\nhard and flushing crimson, gave into Alexey Alexandrovitch’s hands the\\nletter she had received.\\n\\nAfter reading the letter, he sat a long while in silence.\\n\\n“I don’t think I have the right to refuse her,” he said, timidly\\nlifting his eyes.\\n\\n“Dear friend, you never see evil in anyone!”\\n\\n“On the contrary, I see that all is evil. But whether it is just....”\\n\\nHis face showed irresolution, and a seeking for counsel, support, and\\nguidance in a matter he did not understand.\\n\\n“No,” Countess Lidia Ivanovna interrupted him; “there are limits to\\neverything. I can understand immorality,” she said, not quite\\ntruthfully, since she never could understand that which leads women to\\nimmorality; “but I don’t understand cruelty: to whom? to you! How can\\nshe stay in the town where you are? No, the longer one lives the more\\none learns. And I’m learning to understand your loftiness and her\\nbaseness.”\\n\\n“Who is to throw a stone?” said Alexey Alexandrovitch, unmistakably\\npleased with the part he had to play. “I have forgiven all, and so I\\ncannot deprive her of what is exacted by love in her—by her love for\\nher son....”\\n\\n“But is that love, my friend? Is it sincere? Admitting that you have\\nforgiven—that you forgive—have we the right to work on the feelings of\\nthat angel? He looks on her as dead. He prays for her, and beseeches\\nGod to have mercy on her sins. And it is better so. But now what will\\nhe think?”\\n\\n“I had not thought of that,” said Alexey Alexandrovitch, evidently\\nagreeing.\\n\\nCountess Lidia Ivanovna hid her face in her hands and was silent. She\\nwas praying.\\n\\n“If you ask my advice,” she said, having finished her prayer and\\nuncovered her face, “I do not advise you to do this. Do you suppose I\\ndon’t see how you are suffering, how this has torn open your wounds?\\nBut supposing that, as always, you don’t think of yourself, what can it\\nlead to?—to fresh suffering for you, to torture for the child. If there\\nwere a trace of humanity left in her, she ought not to wish for it\\nherself. No, I have no hesitation in saying I advise not, and if you\\nwill intrust it to me, I will write to her.”\\n\\nAnd Alexey Alexandrovitch consented, and Countess Lidia Ivanovna sent\\nthe following letter in French:\\n\\n\\n“Dear Madame,\\n\\n“To be reminded of you might have results for your son in leading to\\nquestions on his part which could not be answered without implanting in\\nthe child’s soul a spirit of censure towards what should be for him\\nsacred, and therefore I beg you to interpret your husband’s refusal in\\nthe spirit of Christian love. I pray to Almighty God to have mercy on\\nyou.\\n\\n“Countess Lidia.”\\n\\n\\nThis letter attained the secret object which Countess Lidia Ivanovna\\nhad concealed from herself. It wounded Anna to the quick.\\n\\nFor his part, Alexey Alexandrovitch, on returning home from Lidia\\nIvanovna’s, could not all that day concentrate himself on his usual\\npursuits, and find that spiritual peace of one saved and believing\\nwhich he had felt of late.\\n\\nThe thought of his wife, who had so greatly sinned against him, and\\ntowards whom he had been so saintly, as Countess Lidia Ivanovna had so\\njustly told him, ought not to have troubled him; but he was not easy;\\nhe could not understand the book he was reading; he could not drive\\naway harassing recollections of his relations with her, of the mistake\\nwhich, as it now seemed, he had made in regard to her. The memory of\\nhow he had received her confession of infidelity on their way home from\\nthe races (especially that he had insisted only on the observance of\\nexternal decorum, and had not sent a challenge) tortured him like a\\nremorse. He was tortured too by the thought of the letter he had\\nwritten her; and most of all, his forgiveness, which nobody wanted, and\\nhis care of the other man’s child made his heart burn with shame and\\nremorse.\\n\\nAnd just the same feeling of shame and regret he felt now, as he\\nreviewed all his past with her, recalling the awkward words in which,\\nafter long wavering, he had made her an offer.\\n\\n“But how have I been to blame?” he said to himself. And this question\\nalways excited another question in him—whether they felt differently,\\ndid their loving and marrying differently, these Vronskys and Oblonskys\\n... these gentlemen of the bedchamber, with their fine calves. And\\nthere passed before his mind a whole series of these mettlesome,\\nvigorous, self-confident men, who always and everywhere drew his\\ninquisitive attention in spite of himself. He tried to dispel these\\nthoughts, he tried to persuade himself that he was not living for this\\ntransient life, but for the life of eternity, and that there was peace\\nand love in his heart.\\n\\nBut the fact that he had in this transient, trivial life made, as it\\nseemed to him, a few trivial mistakes tortured him as though the\\neternal salvation in which he believed had no existence. But this\\ntemptation did not last long, and soon there was reestablished once\\nmore in Alexey Alexandrovitch’s soul the peace and the elevation by\\nvirtue of which he could forget what he did not want to remember 26\\n\\n“Well, Kapitonitch?” said Seryozha, coming back rosy and good-humored\\nfrom his walk the day before his birthday, and giving his overcoat to\\nthe tall old hall-porter, who smiled down at the little person from the\\nheight of his long figure. “Well, has the bandaged clerk been here\\ntoday? Did papa see him?”\\n\\n“He saw him. The minute the chief secretary came out, I announced him,”\\nsaid the hall-porter with a good-humored wink. “Here, I’ll take it\\noff.”\\n\\n“Seryozha!” said the tutor, stopping in the doorway leading to the\\ninner rooms. “Take it off yourself.” But Seryozha, though he heard his\\ntutor’s feeble voice, did not pay attention to it. He stood keeping\\nhold of the hall-porter’s belt, and gazing into his face.\\n\\n“Well, and did papa do what he wanted for him?”\\n\\nThe hall-porter nodded his head affirmatively. The clerk with his face\\ntied up, who had already been seven times to ask some favor of Alexey\\nAlexandrovitch, interested both Seryozha and the hall-porter. Seryozha\\nhad come upon him in the hall, and had heard him plaintively beg the\\nhall-porter to announce him, saying that he and his children had death\\nstaring them in the face.\\n\\nSince then Seryozha, having met him a second time in the hall, took\\ngreat interest in him.\\n\\n“Well, was he very glad?” he asked.\\n\\n“Glad? I should think so! Almost dancing as he walked away.”\\n\\n“And has anything been left?” asked Seryozha, after a pause.\\n\\n“Come, sir,” said the hall-porter; then with a shake of his head he\\nwhispered, “Something from the countess.”\\n\\nSeryozha understood at once that what the hall-porter was speaking of\\nwas a present from Countess Lidia Ivanovna for his birthday.\\n\\n“What do you say? Where?”\\n\\n“Korney took it to your papa. A fine plaything it must be too!”\\n\\n“How big? Like this?”\\n\\n“Rather small, but a fine thing.”\\n\\n“A book.”\\n\\n“No, a thing. Run along, run along, Vassily Lukitch is calling you,”\\nsaid the porter, hearing the tutor’s steps approaching, and carefully\\ntaking away from his belt the little hand in the glove half pulled off,\\nhe signed with his head towards the tutor.\\n\\n“Vassily Lukitch, in a tiny minute!” answered Seryozha with that gay\\nand loving smile which always won over the conscientious Vassily\\nLukitch.\\n\\nSeryozha was too happy, everything was too delightful for him to be\\nable to help sharing with his friend the porter the family good fortune\\nof which he had heard during his walk in the public gardens from Lidia\\nIvanovna’s niece. This piece of good news seemed to him particularly\\nimportant from its coming at the same time with the gladness of the\\nbandaged clerk and his own gladness at toys having come for him. It\\nseemed to Seryozha that this was a day on which everyone ought to be\\nglad and happy.\\n\\n“You know papa’s received the Alexander Nevsky today?”\\n\\n“To be sure I do! People have been already to congratulate him.”\\n\\n“And is he glad?”\\n\\n“Glad at the Tsar’s gracious favor! I should think so! It’s a proof\\nhe’s deserved it,” said the porter severely and seriously.\\n\\nSeryozha fell to dreaming, gazing up at the face of the porter, which\\nhe had thoroughly studied in every detail, especially the chin that\\nhung down between the gray whiskers, never seen by anyone but Seryozha,\\nwho saw him only from below.\\n\\n“Well, and has your daughter been to see you lately?”\\n\\nThe porter’s daughter was a ballet dancer.\\n\\n“When is she to come on week-days? They’ve their lessons to learn too.\\nAnd you’ve your lesson, sir; run along.”\\n\\nOn coming into the room, Seryozha, instead of sitting down to his\\nlessons, told his tutor of his supposition that what had been brought\\nhim must be a machine. “What do you think?” he inquired.\\n\\nBut Vassily Lukitch was thinking of nothing but the necessity of\\nlearning the grammar lesson for the teacher, who was coming at two.\\n\\n“No, do just tell me, Vassily Lukitch,” he asked suddenly, when he was\\nseated at their work table with the book in his hands, “what is greater\\nthan the Alexander Nevsky? You know papa’s received the Alexander\\nNevsky?”\\n\\nVassily Lukitch replied that the Vladimir was greater than the\\nAlexander Nevsky.\\n\\n“And higher still?”\\n\\n“Well, highest of all is the Andrey Pervozvanny.”\\n\\n“And higher than the Andrey?”\\n\\n“I don’t know.”\\n\\n“What, you don’t know?” and Seryozha, leaning on his elbows, sank into\\ndeep meditation.\\n\\nHis meditations were of the most complex and diverse character. He\\nimagined his father’s having suddenly been presented with both the\\nVladimir and the Andrey today, and in consequence being much better\\ntempered at his lesson, and dreamed how, when he was grown up, he would\\nhimself receive all the orders, and what they might invent higher than\\nthe Andrey. Directly any higher order were invented, he would win it.\\nThey would make a higher one still, and he would immediately win that\\ntoo.\\n\\nThe time passed in such meditations, and when the teacher came, the\\nlesson about the adverbs of place and time and manner of action was not\\nready, and the teacher was not only displeased, but hurt. This touched\\nSeryozha. He felt he was not to blame for not having learned the\\nlesson; however much he tried, he was utterly unable to do that. As\\nlong as the teacher was explaining to him, he believed him and seemed\\nto comprehend, but as soon as he was left alone, he was positively\\nunable to recollect and to understand that the short and familiar word\\n“suddenly” is an adverb of manner of action. Still he was sorry that he\\nhad disappointed the teacher.\\n\\nHe chose a moment when the teacher was looking in silence at the book.\\n\\n“Mihail Ivanitch, when is your birthday?” he asked all, of a sudden.\\n\\n“You’d much better be thinking about your work. Birthdays are of no\\nimportance to a rational being. It’s a day like any other on which one\\nhas to do one’s work.”\\n\\nSeryozha looked intently at the teacher, at his scanty beard, at his\\nspectacles, which had slipped down below the ridge on his nose, and\\nfell into so deep a reverie that he heard nothing of what the teacher\\nwas explaining to him. He knew that the teacher did not think what he\\nsaid; he felt it from the tone in which it was said. “But why have they\\nall agreed to speak just in the same manner always the dreariest and\\nmost useless stuff? Why does he keep me off; why doesn’t he love me?”\\nhe asked himself mournfully, and could not think of an answer 27\\n\\nAfter the lesson with the grammar teacher came his father’s lesson.\\nWhile waiting for his father, Seryozha sat at the table playing with a\\npenknife, and fell to dreaming. Among Seryozha’s favorite occupations\\nwas searching for his mother during his walks. He did not believe in\\ndeath generally, and in her death in particular, in spite of what Lidia\\nIvanovna had told him and his father had confirmed, and it was just\\nbecause of that, and after he had been told she was dead, that he had\\nbegun looking for her when out for a walk. Every woman of full,\\ngraceful figure with dark hair was his mother. At the sight of such a\\nwoman such a feeling of tenderness was stirred within him that his\\nbreath failed him, and tears came into his eyes. And he was on the\\ntiptoe of expectation that she would come up to him, would lift her\\nveil. All her face would be visible, she would smile, she would hug\\nhim, he would sniff her fragrance, feel the softness of her arms, and\\ncry with happiness, just as he had one evening lain on her lap while\\nshe tickled him, and he laughed and bit her white, ring-covered\\nfingers. Later, when he accidentally learned from his old nurse that\\nhis mother was not dead, and his father and Lidia Ivanovna had\\nexplained to him that she was dead to him because she was wicked (which\\nhe could not possibly believe, because he loved her), he went on\\nseeking her and expecting her in the same way. That day in the public\\ngardens there had been a lady in a lilac veil, whom he had watched with\\na throbbing heart, believing it to be she as she came towards them\\nalong the path. The lady had not come up to them, but had disappeared\\nsomewhere. That day, more intensely than ever, Seryozha felt a rush of\\nlove for her, and now, waiting for his father, he forgot everything,\\nand cut all round the edge of the table with his penknife, staring\\nstraight before him with sparkling eyes and dreaming of her.\\n\\n“Here is your papa!” said Vassily Lukitch, rousing him.\\n\\nSeryozha jumped up and went up to his father, and kissing his hand,\\nlooked at him intently, trying to discover signs of his joy at\\nreceiving the Alexander Nevsky.\\n\\n“Did you have a nice walk?” said Alexey Alexandrovitch, sitting down in\\nhis easy chair, pulling the volume of the Old Testament to him and\\nopening it. Although Alexey Alexandrovitch had more than once told\\nSeryozha that every Christian ought to know Scripture history\\nthoroughly, he often referred to the Bible himself during the lesson,\\nand Seryozha observed this.\\n\\n“Yes, it was very nice indeed, papa,” said Seryozha, sitting sideways\\non his chair and rocking it, which was forbidden. “I saw Nadinka”\\n(Nadinka was a niece of Lidia Ivanovna’s who was being brought up in\\nher house). “She told me you’d been given a new star. Are you glad,\\npapa?”\\n\\n“First of all, don’t rock your chair, please,” said Alexey\\nAlexandrovitch. “And secondly, it’s not the reward that’s precious, but\\nthe work itself. And I could have wished you understood that. If you\\nnow are going to work, to study in order to win a reward, then the work\\nwill seem hard to you; but when you work” (Alexey Alexandrovitch, as he\\nspoke, thought of how he had been sustained by a sense of duty through\\nthe wearisome labor of the morning, consisting of signing one hundred\\nand eighty papers), “loving your work, you will find your reward in\\nit.”\\n\\nSeryozha’s eyes, that had been shining with gaiety and tenderness, grew\\ndull and dropped before his father’s gaze. This was the same\\nlong-familiar tone his father always took with him, and Seryozha had\\nlearned by now to fall in with it. His father always talked to him—so\\nSeryozha felt—as though he were addressing some boy of his own\\nimagination, one of those boys that exist in books, utterly unlike\\nhimself. And Seryozha always tried with his father to act being the\\nstory-book boy.\\n\\n“You understand that, I hope?” said his father.\\n\\n“Yes, papa,” answered Seryozha, acting the part of the imaginary boy.\\n\\nThe lesson consisted of learning by heart several verses out of the\\nGospel and the repetition of the beginning of the Old Testament. The\\nverses from the Gospel Seryozha knew fairly well, but at the moment\\nwhen he was saying them he became so absorbed in watching the sharply\\nprotruding, bony knobbiness of his father’s forehead, that he lost the\\nthread, and he transposed the end of one verse and the beginning of\\nanother. So it was evident to Alexey Alexandrovitch that he did not\\nunderstand what he was saying, and that irritated him.\\n\\nHe frowned, and began explaining what Seryozha had heard many times\\nbefore and never could remember, because he understood it too well,\\njust as that “suddenly” is an adverb of manner of action. Seryozha\\nlooked with scared eyes at his father, and could think of nothing but\\nwhether his father would make him repeat what he had said, as he\\nsometimes did. And this thought so alarmed Seryozha that he now\\nunderstood nothing. But his father did not make him repeat it, and\\npassed on to the lesson out of the Old Testament. Seryozha recounted\\nthe events themselves well enough, but when he had to answer questions\\nas to what certain events prefigured, he knew nothing, though he had\\nalready been punished over this lesson. The passage at which he was\\nutterly unable to say anything, and began fidgeting and cutting the\\ntable and swinging his chair, was where he had to repeat the patriarchs\\nbefore the Flood. He did not know one of them, except Enoch, who had\\nbeen taken up alive to heaven. Last time he had remembered their names,\\nbut now he had forgotten them utterly, chiefly because Enoch was the\\npersonage he liked best in the whole of the Old Testament, and Enoch’s\\ntranslation to heaven was connected in his mind with a whole long train\\nof thought, in which he became absorbed now while he gazed with\\nfascinated eyes at his father’s watch-chain and a half-unbuttoned\\nbutton on his waistcoat.\\n\\nIn death, of which they talked to him so often, Seryozha disbelieved\\nentirely. He did not believe that those he loved could die, above all\\nthat he himself would die. That was to him something utterly\\ninconceivable and impossible. But he had been told that all men die; he\\nhad asked people, indeed, whom he trusted, and they too, had confirmed\\nit; his old nurse, too, said the same, though reluctantly. But Enoch\\nhad not died, and so it followed that everyone did not die. “And why\\ncannot anyone else so serve God and be taken alive to heaven?” thought\\nSeryozha. Bad people, that is those Seryozha did not like, they might\\ndie, but the good might all be like Enoch.\\n\\n“Well, what are the names of the patriarchs?”\\n\\n“Enoch, Enos—”\\n\\n“But you have said that already. This is bad, Seryozha, very bad. If\\nyou don’t try to learn what is more necessary than anything for a\\nChristian,” said his father, getting up, “whatever can interest you? I\\nam displeased with you, and Piotr Ignatitch” (this was the most\\nimportant of his teachers) “is displeased with you.... I shall have to\\npunish you.”\\n\\nHis father and his teacher were both displeased with Seryozha, and he\\ncertainly did learn his lessons very badly. But still it could not be\\nsaid he was a stupid boy. On the contrary, he was far cleverer than the\\nboys his teacher held up as examples to Seryozha. In his father’s\\nopinion, he did not want to learn what he was taught. In reality he\\ncould not learn that. He could not, because the claims of his own soul\\nwere more binding on him than those claims his father and his teacher\\nmade upon him. Those claims were in opposition, and he was in direct\\nconflict with his education. He was nine years old; he was a child; but\\nhe knew his own soul, it was precious to him, he guarded it as the\\neyelid guards the eye, and without the key of love he let no one into\\nhis soul. His teachers complained that he would not learn, while his\\nsoul was brimming over with thirst for knowledge. And he learned from\\nKapitonitch, from his nurse, from Nadinka, from Vassily Lukitch, but\\nnot from his teachers. The spring his father and his teachers reckoned\\nupon to turn their mill-wheels had long dried up at the source, but its\\nwaters did their work in another channel.\\n\\nHis father punished Seryozha by not letting him go to see Nadinka,\\nLidia Ivanovna’s niece; but this punishment turned out happily for\\nSeryozha. Vassily Lukitch was in a good humor, and showed him how to\\nmake windmills. The whole evening passed over this work and in dreaming\\nhow to make a windmill on which he could turn himself—clutching at the\\nsails or tying himself on and whirling round. Of his mother Seryozha\\ndid not think all the evening, but when he had gone to bed, he suddenly\\nremembered her, and prayed in his own words that his mother tomorrow\\nfor his birthday might leave off hiding herself and come to him.\\n\\n“Vassily Lukitch, do you know what I prayed for tonight extra besides\\nthe regular things?”\\n\\n“That you might learn your lessons better?”\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\n“Toys?”\\n\\n“No. You’ll never guess. A splendid thing; but it’s a secret! When it\\ncomes to pass I’ll tell you. Can’t you guess!”\\n\\n“No, I can’t guess. You tell me,” said Vassily Lukitch with a smile,\\nwhich was rare with him. “Come, lie down, I’m putting out the candle.”\\n\\n“Without the candle I can see better what I see and what I prayed for.\\nThere! I was almost telling the secret!” said Seryozha, laughing gaily.\\n\\nWhen the candle was taken away, Seryozha heard and felt his mother. She\\nstood over him, and with loving eyes caressed him. But then came\\nwindmills, a knife, everything began to be mixed up, and he fell\\nasleep 28\\n\\nOn arriving in Petersburg, Vronsky and Anna stayed at one of the best\\nhotels; Vronsky apart in a lower story, Anna above with her child, its\\nnurse, and her maid, in a large suite of four rooms.\\n\\nOn the day of his arrival Vronsky went to his brother’s. There he found\\nhis mother, who had come from Moscow on business. His mother and\\nsister-in-law greeted him as usual: they asked him about his stay\\nabroad, and talked of their common acquaintances, but did not let drop\\na single word in allusion to his connection with Anna. His brother came\\nthe next morning to see Vronsky, and of his own accord asked him about\\nher, and Alexey Vronsky told him directly that he looked upon his\\nconnection with Madame Karenina as marriage; that he hoped to arrange a\\ndivorce, and then to marry her, and until then he considered her as\\nmuch a wife as any other wife, and he begged him to tell their mother\\nand his wife so.\\n\\n“If the world disapproves, I don’t care,” said Vronsky; “but if my\\nrelations want to be on terms of relationship with me, they will have\\nto be on the same terms with my wife.”\\n\\nThe elder brother, who had always a respect for his younger brother’s\\njudgment, could not well tell whether he was right or not till the\\nworld had decided the question; for his part he had nothing against it,\\nand with Alexey he went up to see Anna.\\n\\nBefore his brother, as before everyone, Vronsky addressed Anna with a\\ncertain formality, treating her as he might a very intimate friend, but\\nit was understood that his brother knew their real relations, and they\\ntalked about Anna’s going to Vronsky’s estate.\\n\\nIn spite of all his social experience Vronsky was, in consequence of\\nthe new position in which he was placed, laboring under a strange\\nmisapprehension. One would have thought he must have understood that\\nsociety was closed for him and Anna; but now some vague ideas had\\nsprung up in his brain that this was only the case in old-fashioned\\ndays, and that now with the rapidity of modern progress (he had\\nunconsciously become by now a partisan of every sort of progress) the\\nviews of society had changed, and that the question whether they would\\nbe received in society was not a foregone conclusion. “Of course,” he\\nthought, “she would not be received at court, but intimate friends can\\nand must look at it in the proper light.” One may sit for several hours\\nat a stretch with one’s legs crossed in the same position, if one knows\\nthat there’s nothing to prevent one’s changing one’s position; but if a\\nman knows that he must remain sitting so with crossed legs, then cramps\\ncome on, the legs begin to twitch and to strain towards the spot to\\nwhich one would like to draw them. This was what Vronsky was\\nexperiencing in regard to the world. Though at the bottom of his heart\\nhe knew that the world was shut on them, he put it to the test whether\\nthe world had not changed by now and would not receive them. But he\\nvery quickly perceived that though the world was open for him\\npersonally, it was closed for Anna. Just as in the game of cat and\\nmouse, the hands raised for him were dropped to bar the way for Anna.\\n\\nOne of the first ladies of Petersburg society whom Vronsky saw was his\\ncousin Betsy.\\n\\n“At last!” she greeted him joyfully. “And Anna? How glad I am! Where\\nare you stopping? I can fancy after your delightful travels you must\\nfind our poor Petersburg horrid. I can fancy your honeymoon in Rome.\\nHow about the divorce? Is that all over?”\\n\\nVronsky noticed that Betsy’s enthusiasm waned when she learned that no\\ndivorce had as yet taken place.\\n\\n“People will throw stones at me, I know,” she said, “but I shall come\\nand see Anna; yes, I shall certainly come. You won’t be here long, I\\nsuppose?”\\n\\nAnd she did certainly come to see Anna the same day, but her tone was\\nnot at all the same as in former days. She unmistakably prided herself\\non her courage, and wished Anna to appreciate the fidelity of her\\nfriendship. She only stayed ten minutes, talking of society gossip, and\\non leaving she said:\\n\\n“You’ve never told me when the divorce is to be? Supposing I’m ready to\\nfling my cap over the mill, other starchy people will give you the cold\\nshoulder until you’re married. And that’s so simple nowadays. _Ça se\\nfait_. So you’re going on Friday? Sorry we shan’t see each other\\nagain.”\\n\\nFrom Betsy’s tone Vronsky might have grasped what he had to expect from\\nthe world; but he made another effort in his own family. His mother he\\ndid not reckon upon. He knew that his mother, who had been so\\nenthusiastic over Anna at their first acquaintance, would have no mercy\\non her now for having ruined her son’s career. But he had more hope of\\nVarya, his brother’s wife. He fancied she would not throw stones, and\\nwould go simply and directly to see Anna, and would receive her in her\\nown house.\\n\\nThe day after his arrival Vronsky went to her, and finding her alone,\\nexpressed his wishes directly.\\n\\n“You know, Alexey,” she said after hearing him, “how fond I am of you,\\nand how ready I am to do anything for you; but I have not spoken,\\nbecause I knew I could be of no use to you and to Anna Arkadyevna,” she\\nsaid, articulating the name “Anna Arkadyevna” with particular care.\\n“Don’t suppose, please, that I judge her. Never; perhaps in her place I\\nshould have done the same. I don’t and can’t enter into that,” she\\nsaid, glancing timidly at his gloomy face. “But one must call things by\\ntheir names. You want me to go and see her, to ask her here, and to\\nrehabilitate her in society; but do understand that _I cannot_ do so. I\\nhave daughters growing up, and I must live in the world for my\\nhusband’s sake. Well, I’m ready to come and see Anna Arkadyevna: she\\nwill understand that I can’t ask her here, or I should have to do so in\\nsuch a way that she would not meet people who look at things\\ndifferently; that would offend her. I can’t raise her....”\\n\\n“Oh, I don’t regard her as fallen more than hundreds of women you do\\nreceive!” Vronsky interrupted her still more gloomily, and he got up in\\nsilence, understanding that his sister-in-law’s decision was not to be\\nshaken.\\n\\n“Alexey! don’t be angry with me. Please understand that I’m not to\\nblame,” began Varya, looking at him with a timid smile.\\n\\n“I’m not angry with you,” he said still as gloomily; “but I’m sorry in\\ntwo ways. I’m sorry, too, that this means breaking up our friendship—if\\nnot breaking up, at least weakening it. You will understand that for\\nme, too, it cannot be otherwise.”\\n\\nAnd with that he left her.\\n\\nVronsky knew that further efforts were useless, and that he had to\\nspend these few days in Petersburg as though in a strange town,\\navoiding every sort of relation with his own old circle in order not to\\nbe exposed to the annoyances and humiliations which were so intolerable\\nto him. One of the most unpleasant features of his position in\\nPetersburg was that Alexey Alexandrovitch and his name seemed to meet\\nhim everywhere. He could not begin to talk of anything without the\\nconversation turning on Alexey Alexandrovitch; he could not go anywhere\\nwithout risk of meeting him. So at least it seemed to Vronsky, just as\\nit seems to a man with a sore finger that he is continually, as though\\non purpose, grazing his sore finger on everything.\\n\\nTheir stay in Petersburg was the more painful to Vronsky that he\\nperceived all the time a sort of new mood that he could not understand\\nin Anna. At one time she would seem in love with him, and then she\\nwould become cold, irritable, and impenetrable. She was worrying over\\nsomething, and keeping something back from him, and did not seem to\\nnotice the humiliations which poisoned his existence, and for her, with\\nher delicate intuition, must have been still more unbearable 29\\n\\nOne of Anna’s objects in coming back to Russia had been to see her son.\\nFrom the day she left Italy the thought of it had never ceased to\\nagitate her. And as she got nearer to Petersburg, the delight and\\nimportance of this meeting grew ever greater in her imagination. She\\ndid not even put to herself the question how to arrange it. It seemed\\nto her natural and simple to see her son when she should be in the same\\ntown with him. But on her arrival in Petersburg she was suddenly made\\ndistinctly aware of her present position in society, and she grasped\\nthe fact that to arrange this meeting was no easy matter.\\n\\nShe had now been two days in Petersburg. The thought of her son never\\nleft her for a single instant, but she had not yet seen him. To go\\nstraight to the house, where she might meet Alexey Alexandrovitch, that\\nshe felt she had no right to do. She might be refused admittance and\\ninsulted. To write and so enter into relations with her husband—that it\\nmade her miserable to think of doing; she could only be at peace when\\nshe did not think of her husband. To get a glimpse of her son out\\nwalking, finding out where and when he went out, was not enough for\\nher; she had so looked forward to this meeting, she had so much she\\nmust say to him, she so longed to embrace him, to kiss him. Seryozha’s\\nold nurse might be a help to her and show her what to do. But the nurse\\nwas not now living in Alexey Alexandrovitch’s house. In this\\nuncertainty, and in efforts to find the nurse, two days had slipped by.\\n\\nHearing of the close intimacy between Alexey Alexandrovitch and\\nCountess Lidia Ivanovna, Anna decided on the third day to write to her\\na letter, which cost her great pains, and in which she intentionally\\nsaid that permission to see her son must depend on her husband’s\\ngenerosity. She knew that if the letter were shown to her husband, he\\nwould keep up his character of magnanimity, and would not refuse her\\nrequest.\\n\\nThe commissionaire who took the letter had brought her back the most\\ncruel and unexpected answer, that there was no answer. She had never\\nfelt so humiliated as at the moment when, sending for the\\ncommissionaire, she heard from him the exact account of how he had\\nwaited, and how afterwards he had been told there was no answer. Anna\\nfelt humiliated, insulted, but she saw that from her point of view\\nCountess Lidia Ivanovna was right. Her suffering was the more poignant\\nthat she had to bear it in solitude. She could not and would not share\\nit with Vronsky. She knew that to him, although he was the primary\\ncause of her distress, the question of her seeing her son would seem a\\nmatter of very little consequence. She knew that he would never be\\ncapable of understanding all the depth of her suffering, that for his\\ncool tone at any allusion to it she would begin to hate him. And she\\ndreaded that more than anything in the world, and so she hid from him\\neverything that related to her son. Spending the whole day at home she\\nconsidered ways of seeing her son, and had reached a decision to write\\nto her husband. She was just composing this letter when she was handed\\nthe letter from Lidia Ivanovna. The countess’s silence had subdued and\\ndepressed her, but the letter, all that she read between the lines in\\nit, so exasperated her, this malice was so revolting beside her\\npassionate, legitimate tenderness for her son, that she turned against\\nother people and left off blaming herself.\\n\\n“This coldness—this pretense of feeling!” she said to herself. “They\\nmust needs insult me and torture the child, and I am to submit to it!\\nNot on any consideration! She is worse than I am. I don’t lie, anyway.”\\nAnd she decided on the spot that next day, Seryozha’s birthday, she\\nwould go straight to her husband’s house, bribe or deceive the\\nservants, but at any cost see her son and overturn the hideous\\ndeception with which they were encompassing the unhappy child.\\n\\nShe went to a toy shop, bought toys and thought over a plan of action.\\nShe would go early in the morning at eight o’clock, when Alexey\\nAlexandrovitch would be certain not to be up. She would have money in\\nher hand to give the hall-porter and the footman, so that they should\\nlet her in, and not raising her veil, she would say that she had come\\nfrom Seryozha’s godfather to congratulate him, and that she had been\\ncharged to leave the toys at his bedside. She had prepared everything\\nbut the words she should say to her son. Often as she had dreamed of\\nit, she could never think of anything.\\n\\nThe next day, at eight o’clock in the morning, Anna got out of a hired\\nsledge and rang at the front entrance of her former home.\\n\\n“Run and see what’s wanted. Some lady,” said Kapitonitch, who, not yet\\ndressed, in his overcoat and galoshes, had peeped out of the window and\\nseen a lady in a veil standing close up to the door. His assistant, a\\nlad Anna did not know, had no sooner opened the door to her than she\\ncame in, and pulling a three-rouble note out of her muff put it\\nhurriedly into his hand.\\n\\n“Seryozha—Sergey Alexeitch,” she said, and was going on. Scrutinizing\\nthe note, the porter’s assistant stopped her at the second glass door.\\n\\n“Whom do you want?” he asked.\\n\\nShe did not hear his words and made no answer.\\n\\nNoticing the embarrassment of the unknown lady, Kapitonitch went out to\\nher, opened the second door for her, and asked her what she was pleased\\nto want.\\n\\n“From Prince Skorodumov for Sergey Alexeitch,” she said.\\n\\n“His honor’s not up yet,” said the porter, looking at her attentively.\\n\\nAnna had not anticipated that the absolutely unchanged hall of the\\nhouse where she had lived for nine years would so greatly affect her.\\nMemories sweet and painful rose one after another in her heart, and for\\na moment she forgot what she was here for.\\n\\n“Would you kindly wait?” said Kapitonitch, taking off her fur cloak.\\n\\nAs he took off the cloak, Kapitonitch glanced at her face, recognized\\nher, and made her a low bow in silence.\\n\\n“Please walk in, your excellency,” he said to her.\\n\\nShe tried to say something, but her voice refused to utter any sound;\\nwith a guilty and imploring glance at the old man she went with light,\\nswift steps up the stairs. Bent double, and his galoshes catching in\\nthe steps, Kapitonitch ran after her, trying to overtake her.\\n\\n“The tutor’s there; maybe he’s not dressed. I’ll let him know.”\\n\\nAnna still mounted the familiar staircase, not understanding what the\\nold man was saying.\\n\\n“This way, to the left, if you please. Excuse its not being tidy. His\\nhonor’s in the old parlor now,” the hall-porter said, panting. “Excuse\\nme, wait a little, your excellency; I’ll just see,” he said, and\\novertaking her, he opened the high door and disappeared behind it. Anna\\nstood still waiting. “He’s only just awake,” said the hall-porter,\\ncoming out. And at the very instant the porter said this, Anna caught\\nthe sound of a childish yawn. From the sound of this yawn alone she\\nknew her son and seemed to see him living before her eyes.\\n\\n“Let me in; go away!” she said, and went in through the high doorway.\\nOn the right of the door stood a bed, and sitting up in the bed was the\\nboy. His little body bent forward with his nightshirt unbuttoned, he\\nwas stretching and still yawning. The instant his lips came together\\nthey curved into a blissfully sleepy smile, and with that smile he\\nslowly and deliciously rolled back again.\\n\\n“Seryozha!” she whispered, going noiselessly up to him.\\n\\nWhen she was parted from him, and all this latter time when she had\\nbeen feeling a fresh rush of love for him, she had pictured him as he\\nwas at four years old, when she had loved him most of all. Now he was\\nnot even the same as when she had left him; he was still further from\\nthe four-year-old baby, more grown and thinner. How thin his face was,\\nhow short his hair was! What long hands! How he had changed since she\\nleft him! But it was he with his head, his lips, his soft neck and\\nbroad little shoulders.\\n\\n“Seryozha!” she repeated just in the child’s ear.\\n\\nHe raised himself again on his elbow, turned his tangled head from side\\nto side as though looking for something, and opened his eyes. Slowly\\nand inquiringly he looked for several seconds at his mother standing\\nmotionless before him, then all at once he smiled a blissful smile, and\\nshutting his eyes, rolled not backwards but towards her into her arms.\\n\\n“Seryozha! my darling boy!” she said, breathing hard and putting her\\narms round his plump little body. “Mother!” he said, wriggling about in\\nher arms so as to touch her hands with different parts of him.\\n\\nSmiling sleepily still with closed eyes, he flung fat little arms round\\nher shoulders, rolled towards her, with the delicious sleepy warmth and\\nfragrance that is only found in children, and began rubbing his face\\nagainst her neck and shoulders.\\n\\n“I know,” he said, opening his eyes; “it’s my birthday today. I knew\\nyou’d come. I’ll get up directly.”\\n\\nAnd saying that he dropped asleep.\\n\\nAnna looked at him hungrily; she saw how he had grown and changed in\\nher absence. She knew, and did not know, the bare legs so long now,\\nthat were thrust out below the quilt, those short-cropped curls on his\\nneck in which she had so often kissed him. She touched all this and\\ncould say nothing; tears choked her.\\n\\n“What are you crying for, mother?” he said, waking completely up.\\n“Mother, what are you crying for?” he cried in a tearful voice.\\n\\n“I won’t cry ... I’m crying for joy. It’s so long since I’ve seen you.\\nI won’t, I won’t,” she said, gulping down her tears and turning away.\\n“Come, it’s time for you to dress now,” she added, after a pause, and,\\nnever letting go his hands, she sat down by his bedside on the chair,\\nwhere his clothes were put ready for him.\\n\\n“How do you dress without me? How....” she tried to begin talking\\nsimply and cheerfully, but she could not, and again she turned away.\\n\\n“I don’t have a cold bath, papa didn’t order it. And you’ve not seen\\nVassily Lukitch? He’ll come in soon. Why, you’re sitting on my\\nclothes!”\\n\\nAnd Seryozha went off into a peal of laughter. She looked at him and\\nsmiled.\\n\\n“Mother, darling, sweet one!” he shouted, flinging himself on her again\\nand hugging her. It was as though only now, on seeing her smile, he\\nfully grasped what had happened.\\n\\n“I don’t want that on,” he said, taking off her hat. And as it were,\\nseeing her afresh without her hat, he fell to kissing her again.\\n\\n“But what did you think about me? You didn’t think I was dead?”\\n\\n“I never believed it.”\\n\\n“You didn’t believe it, my sweet?”\\n\\n“I knew, I knew!” he repeated his favorite phrase, and snatching the\\nhand that was stroking his hair, he pressed the open palm to his mouth\\nand kissed it 30\\n\\nMeanwhile Vassily Lukitch had not at first understood who this lady\\nwas, and had learned from their conversation that it was no other\\nperson than the mother who had left her husband, and whom he had not\\nseen, as he had entered the house after her departure. He was in doubt\\nwhether to go in or not, or whether to communicate with Alexey\\nAlexandrovitch. Reflecting finally that his duty was to get Seryozha up\\nat the hour fixed, and that it was therefore not his business to\\nconsider who was there, the mother or anyone else, but simply to do his\\nduty, he finished dressing, went to the door and opened it.\\n\\nBut the embraces of the mother and child, the sound of their voices,\\nand what they were saying, made him change his mind.\\n\\nHe shook his head, and with a sigh he closed the door. “I’ll wait\\nanother ten minutes,” he said to himself, clearing his throat and\\nwiping away tears.\\n\\nAmong the servants of the household there was intense excitement all\\nthis time. All had heard that their mistress had come, and that\\nKapitonitch had let her in, and that she was even now in the nursery,\\nand that their master always went in person to the nursery at nine\\no’clock, and everyone fully comprehended that it was impossible for the\\nhusband and wife to meet, and that they must prevent it. Korney, the\\nvalet, going down to the hall-porter’s room, asked who had let her in,\\nand how it was he had done so, and ascertaining that Kapitonitch had\\nadmitted her and shown her up, he gave the old man a talking-to. The\\nhall-porter was doggedly silent, but when Korney told him he ought to\\nbe sent away, Kapitonitch darted up to him, and waving his hands in\\nKorney’s face, began:\\n\\n“Oh yes, to be sure you’d not have let her in! After ten years’\\nservice, and never a word but of kindness, and there you’d up and say,\\n‘Be off, go along, get away with you!’ Oh yes, you’re a shrewd one at\\npolitics, I dare say! You don’t need to be taught how to swindle the\\nmaster, and to filch fur coats!”\\n\\n“Soldier!” said Korney contemptuously, and he turned to the nurse who\\nwas coming in. “Here, what do you think, Marya Efimovna: he let her in\\nwithout a word to anyone,” Korney said addressing her. “Alexey\\nAlexandrovitch will be down immediately—and go into the nursery!”\\n\\n“A pretty business, a pretty business!” said the nurse. “You, Korney\\nVassilievitch, you’d best keep him some way or other, the master, while\\nI’ll run and get her away somehow. A pretty business!”\\n\\nWhen the nurse went into the nursery, Seryozha was telling his mother\\nhow he and Nadinka had had a fall in sledging downhill, and had turned\\nover three times. She was listening to the sound of his voice, watching\\nhis face and the play of expression on it, touching his hand, but she\\ndid not follow what he was saying. She must go, she must leave\\nhim,—this was the only thing she was thinking and feeling. She heard\\nthe steps of Vassily Lukitch coming up to the door and coughing; she\\nheard, too, the steps of the nurse as she came near; but she sat like\\none turned to stone, incapable of beginning to speak or to get up.\\n\\n“Mistress, darling!” began the nurse, going up to Anna and kissing her\\nhands and shoulders. “God has brought joy indeed to our boy on his\\nbirthday. You aren’t changed one bit.”\\n\\n“Oh, nurse dear, I didn’t know you were in the house,” said Anna,\\nrousing herself for a moment.\\n\\n“I’m not living here, I’m living with my daughter. I came for the\\nbirthday, Anna Arkadyevna, darling!”\\n\\nThe nurse suddenly burst into tears, and began kissing her hand again.\\n\\nSeryozha, with radiant eyes and smiles, holding his mother by one hand\\nand his nurse by the other, pattered on the rug with his fat little\\nbare feet. The tenderness shown by his beloved nurse to his mother\\nthrew him into an ecstasy.\\n\\n“Mother! She often comes to see me, and when she comes....” he was\\nbeginning, but he stopped, noticing that the nurse was saying something\\nin a whisper to his mother, and that in his mother’s face there was a\\nlook of dread and something like shame, which was so strangely\\nunbecoming to her.\\n\\nShe went up to him.\\n\\n“My sweet!” she said.\\n\\nShe could not say _good-bye_, but the expression on her face said it,\\nand he understood. “Darling, darling Kootik!” she used the name by\\nwhich she had called him when he was little, “you won’t forget me?\\nYou....” but she could not say more.\\n\\nHow often afterwards she thought of words she might have said. But now\\nshe did not know how to say it, and could say nothing. But Seryozha\\nknew all she wanted to say to him. He understood that she was unhappy\\nand loved him. He understood even what the nurse had whispered. He had\\ncaught the words “always at nine o’clock,” and he knew that this was\\nsaid of his father, and that his father and mother could not meet. That\\nhe understood, but one thing he could not understand—why there should\\nbe a look of dread and shame in her face?... She was not in fault, but\\nshe was afraid of him and ashamed of something. He would have liked to\\nput a question that would have set at rest this doubt, but he did not\\ndare; he saw that she was miserable, and he felt for her. Silently he\\npressed close to her and whispered, “Don’t go yet. He won’t come just\\nyet.”\\n\\nThe mother held him away from her to see what he was thinking, what to\\nsay to him, and in his frightened face she read not only that he was\\nspeaking of his father, but, as it were, asking her what he ought to\\nthink about his father.\\n\\n“Seryozha, my darling,” she said, “love him; he’s better and kinder\\nthan I am, and I have done him wrong. When you grow up you will judge.”\\n\\n“There’s no one better than you!...” he cried in despair through his\\ntears, and, clutching her by the shoulders, he began squeezing her with\\nall his force to him, his arms trembling with the strain.\\n\\n“My sweet, my little one!” said Anna, and she cried as weakly and\\nchildishly as he.\\n\\nAt that moment the door opened. Vassily Lukitch came in.\\n\\nAt the other door there was the sound of steps, and the nurse in a\\nscared whisper said, “He’s coming,” and gave Anna her hat.\\n\\nSeryozha sank onto the bed and sobbed, hiding his face in his hands.\\nAnna removed his hands, once more kissed his wet face, and with rapid\\nsteps went to the door. Alexey Alexandrovitch walked in, meeting her.\\nSeeing her, he stopped short and bowed his head.\\n\\nAlthough she had just said he was better and kinder than she, in the\\nrapid glance she flung at him, taking in his whole figure in all its\\ndetails, feelings of repulsion and hatred for him and jealousy over her\\nson took possession of her. With a swift gesture she put down her veil,\\nand, quickening her pace, almost ran out of the room.\\n\\nShe had not time to undo, and so carried back with her, the parcel of\\ntoys she had chosen the day before in a toy shop with such love and\\nsorrow 31\\n\\nAs intensely as Anna had longed to see her son, and long as she had\\nbeen thinking of it and preparing herself for it, she had not in the\\nleast expected that seeing him would affect her so deeply. On getting\\nback to her lonely rooms in the hotel she could not for a long while\\nunderstand why she was there. “Yes, it’s all over, and I am again\\nalone,” she said to herself, and without taking off her hat she sat\\ndown in a low chair by the hearth. Fixing her eyes on a bronze clock\\nstanding on a table between the windows, she tried to think.\\n\\nThe French maid brought from abroad came in to suggest she should\\ndress. She gazed at her wonderingly and said, “Presently.” A footman\\noffered her coffee. “Later on,” she said.\\n\\nThe Italian nurse, after having taken the baby out in her best, came in\\nwith her, and brought her to Anna. The plump, well-fed little baby, on\\nseeing her mother, as she always did, held out her fat little hands,\\nand with a smile on her toothless mouth, began, like a fish with a\\nfloat, bobbing her fingers up and down the starched folds of her\\nembroidered skirt, making them rustle. It was impossible not to smile,\\nnot to kiss the baby, impossible not to hold out a finger for her to\\nclutch, crowing and prancing all over; impossible not to offer her a\\nlip which she sucked into her little mouth by way of a kiss. And all\\nthis Anna did, and took her in her arms and made her dance, and kissed\\nher fresh little cheek and bare little elbows; but at the sight of this\\nchild it was plainer than ever to her that the feeling she had for her\\ncould not be called love in comparison with what she felt for Seryozha.\\nEverything in this baby was charming, but for some reason all this did\\nnot go deep to her heart. On her first child, though the child of an\\nunloved father, had been concentrated all the love that had never found\\nsatisfaction. Her baby girl had been born in the most painful\\ncircumstances and had not had a hundredth part of the care and thought\\nwhich had been concentrated on her first child. Besides, in the little\\ngirl everything was still in the future, while Seryozha was by now\\nalmost a personality, and a personality dearly loved. In him there was\\na conflict of thought and feeling; he understood her, he loved her, he\\njudged her, she thought, recalling his words and his eyes. And she was\\nforever—not physically only but spiritually—divided from him, and it\\nwas impossible to set this right.\\n\\nShe gave the baby back to the nurse, let her go, and opened the locket\\nin which there was Seryozha’s portrait when he was almost of the same\\nage as the girl. She got up, and, taking off her hat, took up from a\\nlittle table an album in which there were photographs of her son at\\ndifferent ages. She wanted to compare them, and began taking them out\\nof the album. She took them all out except one, the latest and best\\nphotograph. In it he was in a white smock, sitting astride a chair,\\nwith frowning eyes and smiling lips. It was his best, most\\ncharacteristic expression. With her little supple hands, her white,\\ndelicate fingers, that moved with a peculiar intensity today, she\\npulled at a corner of the photograph, but the photograph had caught\\nsomewhere, and she could not get it out. There was no paper-knife on\\nthe table, and so, pulling out the photograph that was next to her\\nson’s (it was a photograph of Vronsky taken at Rome in a round hat and\\nwith long hair), she used it to push out her son’s photograph. “Oh,\\nhere is he!” she said, glancing at the portrait of Vronsky, and she\\nsuddenly recalled that he was the cause of her present misery. She had\\nnot once thought of him all the morning. But now, coming all at once\\nupon that manly, noble face, so familiar and so dear to her, she felt a\\nsudden rush of love for him.\\n\\n“But where is he? How is it he leaves me alone in my misery?” she\\nthought all at once with a feeling of reproach, forgetting she had\\nherself kept from him everything concerning her son. She sent to ask\\nhim to come to her immediately; with a throbbing heart she awaited him,\\nrehearsing to herself the words in which she would tell him all, and\\nthe expressions of love with which he would console her. The messenger\\nreturned with the answer that he had a visitor with him, but that he\\nwould come immediately, and that he asked whether she would let him\\nbring with him Prince Yashvin, who had just arrived in Petersburg.\\n“He’s not coming alone, and since dinner yesterday he has not seen me,”\\nshe thought; “he’s not coming so that I could tell him everything, but\\ncoming with Yashvin.” And all at once a strange idea came to her: what\\nif he had ceased to love her?\\n\\nAnd going over the events of the last few days, it seemed to her that\\nshe saw in everything a confirmation of this terrible idea. The fact\\nthat he had not dined at home yesterday, and the fact that he had\\ninsisted on their taking separate sets of rooms in Petersburg, and that\\neven now he was not coming to her alone, as though he were trying to\\navoid meeting her face to face.\\n\\n“But he ought to tell me so. I must know that it is so. If I knew it,\\nthen I know what I should do,” she said to herself, utterly unable to\\npicture to herself the position she would be in if she were convinced\\nof his not caring for her. She thought he had ceased to love her, she\\nfelt close upon despair, and consequently she felt exceptionally alert.\\nShe rang for her maid and went to her dressing-room. As she dressed,\\nshe took more care over her appearance than she had done all those\\ndays, as though he might, if he had grown cold to her, fall in love\\nwith her again because she had dressed and arranged her hair in the way\\nmost becoming to her.\\n\\nShe heard the bell ring before she was ready. When she went into the\\ndrawing-room it was not he, but Yashvin, who met her eyes. Vronsky was\\nlooking through the photographs of her son, which she had forgotten on\\nthe table, and he made no haste to look round at her.\\n\\n“We have met already,” she said, putting her little hand into the huge\\nhand of Yashvin, whose bashfulness was so queerly out of keeping with\\nhis immense frame and coarse face. “We met last year at the races. Give\\nthem to me,” she said, with a rapid movement snatching from Vronsky the\\nphotographs of her son, and glancing significantly at him with flashing\\neyes. “Were the races good this year? Instead of them I saw the races\\nin the Corso in Rome. But you don’t care for life abroad,” she said\\nwith a cordial smile. “I know you and all your tastes, though I have\\nseen so little of you.”\\n\\n“I’m awfully sorry for that, for my tastes are mostly bad,” said\\nYashvin, gnawing at his left mustache.\\n\\nHaving talked a little while, and noticing that Vronsky glanced at the\\nclock, Yashvin asked her whether she would be staying much longer in\\nPetersburg, and unbending his huge figure reached after his cap.\\n\\n“Not long, I think,” she said hesitatingly, glancing at Vronsky.\\n\\n“So then we shan’t meet again?”\\n\\n“Come and dine with me,” said Anna resolutely, angry it seemed with\\nherself for her embarrassment, but flushing as she always did when she\\ndefined her position before a fresh person. “The dinner here is not\\ngood, but at least you will see him. There is no one of his old friends\\nin the regiment Alexey cares for as he does for you.”\\n\\n“Delighted,” said Yashvin with a smile, from which Vronsky could see\\nthat he liked Anna very much.\\n\\nYashvin said good-bye and went away; Vronsky stayed behind.\\n\\n“Are you going too?” she said to him.\\n\\n“I’m late already,” he answered. “Run along! I’ll catch you up in a\\nmoment,” he called to Yashvin.\\n\\nShe took him by the hand, and without taking her eyes off him, gazed at\\nhim while she ransacked her mind for the words to say that would keep\\nhim.\\n\\n“Wait a minute, there’s something I want to say to you,” and taking his\\nbroad hand she pressed it on her neck. “Oh, was it right my asking him\\nto dinner?”\\n\\n“You did quite right,” he said with a serene smile that showed his even\\nteeth, and he kissed her hand.\\n\\n“Alexey, you have not changed to me?” she said, pressing his hand in\\nboth of hers. “Alexey, I am miserable here. When are we going away?”\\n\\n“Soon, soon. You wouldn’t believe how disagreeable our way of living\\nhere is to me too,” he said, and he drew away his hand.\\n\\n“Well, go, go!” she said in a tone of offense, and she walked quickly\\naway from him 32\\n\\nWhen Vronsky returned home, Anna was not yet home. Soon after he had\\nleft, some lady, so they told him, had come to see her, and she had\\ngone out with her. That she had gone out without leaving word where she\\nwas going, that she had not yet come back, and that all the morning she\\nhad been going about somewhere without a word to him—all this, together\\nwith the strange look of excitement in her face in the morning, and the\\nrecollection of the hostile tone with which she had before Yashvin\\nalmost snatched her son’s photographs out of his hands, made him\\nserious. He decided he absolutely must speak openly with her. And he\\nwaited for her in her drawing-room. But Anna did not return alone, but\\nbrought with her her old unmarried aunt, Princess Oblonskaya. This was\\nthe lady who had come in the morning, and with whom Anna had gone out\\nshopping. Anna appeared not to notice Vronsky’s worried and inquiring\\nexpression, and began a lively account of her morning’s shopping. He\\nsaw that there was something working within her; in her flashing eyes,\\nwhen they rested for a moment on him, there was an intense\\nconcentration, and in her words and movements there was that nervous\\nrapidity and grace which, during the early period of their intimacy,\\nhad so fascinated him, but which now so disturbed and alarmed him.\\n\\nThe dinner was laid for four. All were gathered together and about to\\ngo into the little dining-room when Tushkevitch made his appearance\\nwith a message from Princess Betsy. Princess Betsy begged her to excuse\\nher not having come to say good-bye; she had been indisposed, but\\nbegged Anna to come to her between half-past six and nine o’clock.\\nVronsky glanced at Anna at the precise limit of time, so suggestive of\\nsteps having been taken that she should meet no one; but Anna appeared\\nnot to notice it.\\n\\n“Very sorry that I can’t come just between half-past six and nine,” she\\nsaid with a faint smile.\\n\\n“The princess will be very sorry.”\\n\\n“And so am I.”\\n\\n“You’re going, no doubt, to hear Patti?” said Tushkevitch.\\n\\n“Patti? You suggest the idea to me. I would go if it were possible to\\nget a box.”\\n\\n“I can get one,” Tushkevitch offered his services.\\n\\n“I should be very, very grateful to you,” said Anna. “But won’t you\\ndine with us?”\\n\\nVronsky gave a hardly perceptible shrug. He was at a complete loss to\\nunderstand what Anna was about. What had she brought the old Princess\\nOblonskaya home for, what had she made Tushkevitch stay to dinner for,\\nand, most amazing of all, why was she sending him for a box? Could she\\npossibly think in her position of going to Patti’s benefit, where all\\nthe circle of her acquaintances would be? He looked at her with serious\\neyes, but she responded with that defiant, half-mirthful,\\nhalf-desperate look, the meaning of which he could not comprehend. At\\ndinner Anna was in aggressively high spirits—she almost flirted both\\nwith Tushkevitch and with Yashvin. When they got up from dinner and\\nTushkevitch had gone to get a box at the opera, Yashvin went to smoke,\\nand Vronsky went down with him to his own rooms. After sitting there\\nfor some time he ran upstairs. Anna was already dressed in a low-necked\\ngown of light silk and velvet that she had had made in Paris, and with\\ncostly white lace on her head, framing her face, and particularly\\nbecoming, showing up her dazzling beauty.\\n\\n“Are you really going to the theater?” he said, trying not to look at\\nher.\\n\\n“Why do you ask with such alarm?” she said, wounded again at his not\\nlooking at her. “Why shouldn’t I go?”\\n\\nShe appeared not to understand the motive of his words.\\n\\n“Oh, of course, there’s no reason whatever,” he said, frowning.\\n\\n“That’s just what I say,” she said, willfully refusing to see the irony\\nof his tone, and quietly turning back her long, perfumed glove.\\n\\n“Anna, for God’s sake! what is the matter with you?” he said, appealing\\nto her exactly as once her husband had done.\\n\\n“I don’t understand what you are asking.”\\n\\n“You know that it’s out of the question to go.”\\n\\n“Why so? I’m not going alone. Princess Varvara has gone to dress, she\\nis going with me.”\\n\\nHe shrugged his shoulders with an air of perplexity and despair.\\n\\n“But do you mean to say you don’t know?...” he began.\\n\\n“But I don’t care to know!” she almost shrieked. “I don’t care to. Do I\\nregret what I have done? No, no, no! If it were all to do again from\\nthe beginning, it would be the same. For us, for you and for me, there\\nis only one thing that matters, whether we love each other. Other\\npeople we need not consider. Why are we living here apart and not\\nseeing each other? Why can’t I go? I love you, and I don’t care for\\nanything,” she said in Russian, glancing at him with a peculiar gleam\\nin her eyes that he could not understand. “If you have not changed to\\nme, why don’t you look at me?”\\n\\nHe looked at her. He saw all the beauty of her face and full dress,\\nalways so becoming to her. But now her beauty and elegance were just\\nwhat irritated him.\\n\\n“My feeling cannot change, you know, but I beg you, I entreat you,” he\\nsaid again in French, with a note of tender supplication in his voice,\\nbut with coldness in his eyes.\\n\\nShe did not hear his words, but she saw the coldness of his eyes, and\\nanswered with irritation:\\n\\n“And I beg you to explain why I should not go.”\\n\\n“Because it might cause you....” he hesitated.\\n\\n“I don’t understand. Yashvin _n’est pas compromettant_, and Princess\\nVarvara is no worse than others. Oh, here she is 33\\n\\nVronsky for the first time experienced a feeling of anger against Anna,\\nalmost a hatred for her willfully refusing to understand her own\\nposition. This feeling was aggravated by his being unable to tell her\\nplainly the cause of his anger. If he had told her directly what he was\\nthinking, he would have said:\\n\\n“In that dress, with a princess only too well known to everyone, to\\nshow yourself at the theater is equivalent not merely to acknowledging\\nyour position as a fallen woman, but is flinging down a challenge to\\nsociety, that is to say, cutting yourself off from it forever.”\\n\\nHe could not say that to her. “But how can she fail to see it, and what\\nis going on in her?” he said to himself. He felt at the same time that\\nhis respect for her was diminished while his sense of her beauty was\\nintensified.\\n\\nHe went back scowling to his rooms, and sitting down beside Yashvin,\\nwho, with his long legs stretched out on a chair, was drinking brandy\\nand seltzer water, he ordered a glass of the same for himself.\\n\\n“You were talking of Lankovsky’s Powerful. That’s a fine horse, and I\\nwould advise you to buy him,” said Yashvin, glancing at his comrade’s\\ngloomy face. “His hind-quarters aren’t quite first-rate, but the legs\\nand head—one couldn’t wish for anything better.”\\n\\n“I think I will take him,” answered Vronsky.\\n\\nTheir conversation about horses interested him, but he did not for an\\ninstant forget Anna, and could not help listening to the sound of steps\\nin the corridor and looking at the clock on the chimney piece.\\n\\n“Anna Arkadyevna gave orders to announce that she has gone to the\\ntheater.”\\n\\nYashvin, tipping another glass of brandy into the bubbling water, drank\\nit and got up, buttoning his coat.\\n\\n“Well, let’s go,” he said, faintly smiling under his mustache, and\\nshowing by this smile that he knew the cause of Vronsky’s gloominess,\\nand did not attach any significance to it.\\n\\n“I’m not going,” Vronsky answered gloomily.\\n\\n“Well, I must, I promised to. Good-bye, then. If you do, come to the\\nstalls; you can take Kruzin’s stall,” added Yashvin as he went out.\\n\\n“No, I’m busy.”\\n\\n“A wife is a care, but it’s worse when she’s not a wife,” thought\\nYashvin, as he walked out of the hotel.\\n\\nVronsky, left alone, got up from his chair and began pacing up and down\\nthe room.\\n\\n“And what’s today? The fourth night.... Yegor and his wife are there,\\nand my mother, most likely. Of course all Petersburg’s there. Now she’s\\ngone in, taken off her cloak and come into the light. Tushkevitch,\\nYashvin, Princess Varvara,” he pictured them to himself.... “What about\\nme? Either that I’m frightened or have given up to Tushkevitch the\\nright to protect her? From every point of view—stupid, stupid!... And\\nwhy is she putting me in such a position?” he said with a gesture of\\ndespair.\\n\\nWith that gesture he knocked against the table, on which there was\\nstanding the seltzer water and the decanter of brandy, and almost upset\\nit. He tried to catch it, let it slip, and angrily kicked the table\\nover and rang.\\n\\n“If you care to be in my service,” he said to the valet who came in,\\n“you had better remember your duties. This shouldn’t be here. You ought\\nto have cleared away.”\\n\\nThe valet, conscious of his own innocence, would have defended himself,\\nbut glancing at his master, he saw from his face that the only thing to\\ndo was to be silent, and hurriedly threading his way in and out,\\ndropped down on the carpet and began gathering up the whole and broken\\nglasses and bottles.\\n\\n“That’s not your duty; send the waiter to clear away, and get my dress\\ncoat out.”\\n\\nVronsky went into the theater at half-past eight. The performance was\\nin full swing. The little old box-keeper, recognizing Vronsky as he\\nhelped him off with his fur coat, called him “Your Excellency,” and\\nsuggested he should not take a number but should simply call Fyodor. In\\nthe brightly lighted corridor there was no one but the box-opener and\\ntwo attendants with fur cloaks on their arms listening at the doors.\\nThrough the closed doors came the sounds of the discreet _staccato_\\naccompaniment of the orchestra, and a single female voice rendering\\ndistinctly a musical phrase. The door opened to let the box-opener slip\\nthrough, and the phrase drawing to the end reached Vronsky’s hearing\\nclearly. But the doors were closed again at once, and Vronsky did not\\nhear the end of the phrase and the cadence of the accompaniment, though\\nhe knew from the thunder of applause that it was over. When he entered\\nthe hall, brilliantly lighted with chandeliers and gas jets, the noise\\nwas still going on. On the stage the singer, bowing and smiling, with\\nbare shoulders flashing with diamonds, was, with the help of the tenor\\nwho had given her his arm, gathering up the bouquets that were flying\\nawkwardly over the footlights. Then she went up to a gentleman with\\nglossy pomaded hair parted down the center, who was stretching across\\nthe footlights holding out something to her, and all the public in the\\nstalls as well as in the boxes was in excitement, craning forward,\\nshouting and clapping. The conductor in his high chair assisted in\\npassing the offering, and straightened his white tie. Vronsky walked\\ninto the middle of the stalls, and, standing still, began looking about\\nhim. That day less than ever was his attention turned upon the\\nfamiliar, habitual surroundings, the stage, the noise, all the\\nfamiliar, uninteresting, particolored herd of spectators in the packed\\ntheater.\\n\\nThere were, as always, the same ladies of some sort with officers of\\nsome sort in the back of the boxes; the same gaily dressed women—God\\nknows who—and uniforms and black coats; the same dirty crowd in the\\nupper gallery; and among the crowd, in the boxes and in the front rows,\\nwere some forty of the _real_ people. And to those oases Vronsky at\\nonce directed his attention, and with them he entered at once into\\nrelation.\\n\\nThe act was over when he went in, and so he did not go straight to his\\nbrother’s box, but going up to the first row of stalls stopped at the\\nfootlights with Serpuhovskoy, who, standing with one knee raised and\\nhis heel on the footlights, caught sight of him in the distance and\\nbeckoned to him, smiling.\\n\\nVronsky had not yet seen Anna. He purposely avoided looking in her\\ndirection. But he knew by the direction of people’s eyes where she was.\\nHe looked round discreetly, but he was not seeking her; expecting the\\nworst, his eyes sought for Alexey Alexandrovitch. To his relief Alexey\\nAlexandrovitch was not in the theater that evening.\\n\\n“How little of the military man there is left in you!” Serpuhovskoy was\\nsaying to him. “A diplomat, an artist, something of that sort, one\\nwould say.”\\n\\n“Yes, it was like going back home when I put on a black coat,” answered\\nVronsky, smiling and slowly taking out his opera-glass.\\n\\n“Well, I’ll own I envy you there. When I come back from abroad and put\\non this,” he touched his epaulets, “I regret my freedom.”\\n\\nSerpuhovskoy had long given up all hope of Vronsky’s career, but he\\nliked him as before, and was now particularly cordial to him.\\n\\n“What a pity you were not in time for the first act!”\\n\\nVronsky, listening with one ear, moved his opera-glass from the stalls\\nand scanned the boxes. Near a lady in a turban and a bald old man, who\\nseemed to wave angrily in the moving opera-glass, Vronsky suddenly\\ncaught sight of Anna’s head, proud, strikingly beautiful, and smiling\\nin the frame of lace. She was in the fifth box, twenty paces from him.\\nShe was sitting in front, and slightly turning, was saying something to\\nYashvin. The setting of her head on her handsome, broad shoulders, and\\nthe restrained excitement and brilliance of her eyes and her whole face\\nreminded him of her just as he had seen her at the ball in Moscow. But\\nhe felt utterly different towards her beauty now. In his feeling for\\nher now there was no element of mystery, and so her beauty, though it\\nattracted him even more intensely than before, gave him now a sense of\\ninjury. She was not looking in his direction, but Vronsky felt that she\\nhad seen him already.\\n\\nWhen Vronsky turned the opera-glass again in that direction, he noticed\\nthat Princess Varvara was particularly red, and kept laughing\\nunnaturally and looking round at the next box. Anna, folding her fan\\nand tapping it on the red velvet, was gazing away and did not see, and\\nobviously did not wish to see, what was taking place in the next box.\\nYashvin’s face wore the expression which was common when he was losing\\nat cards. Scowling, he sucked the left end of his mustache further and\\nfurther into his mouth, and cast sidelong glances at the next box.\\n\\nIn that box on the left were the Kartasovs. Vronsky knew them, and knew\\nthat Anna was acquainted with them. Madame Kartasova, a thin little\\nwoman, was standing up in her box, and, her back turned upon Anna, she\\nwas putting on a mantle that her husband was holding for her. Her face\\nwas pale and angry, and she was talking excitedly. Kartasov, a fat,\\nbald man, was continually looking round at Anna, while he attempted to\\nsoothe his wife. When the wife had gone out, the husband lingered a\\nlong while, and tried to catch Anna’s eye, obviously anxious to bow to\\nher. But Anna, with unmistakable intention, avoided noticing him, and\\ntalked to Yashvin, whose cropped head was bent down to her. Kartasov\\nwent out without making his salutation, and the box was left empty.\\n\\nVronsky could not understand exactly what had passed between the\\nKartasovs and Anna, but he saw that something humiliating for Anna had\\nhappened. He knew this both from what he had seen, and most of all from\\nthe face of Anna, who, he could see, was taxing every nerve to carry\\nthrough the part she had taken up. And in maintaining this attitude of\\nexternal composure she was completely successful. Anyone who did not\\nknow her and her circle, who had not heard all the utterances of the\\nwomen expressive of commiseration, indignation, and amazement, that she\\nshould show herself in society, and show herself so conspicuously with\\nher lace and her beauty, would have admired the serenity and loveliness\\nof this woman without a suspicion that she was undergoing the\\nsensations of a man in the stocks.\\n\\nKnowing that something had happened, but not knowing precisely what,\\nVronsky felt a thrill of agonizing anxiety, and hoping to find out\\nsomething, he went towards his brother’s box. Purposely choosing the\\nway round furthest from Anna’s box, he jostled as he came out against\\nthe colonel of his old regiment talking to two acquaintances. Vronsky\\nheard the name of Madame Karenina, and noticed how the colonel hastened\\nto address Vronsky loudly by name, with a meaning glance at his\\ncompanions.\\n\\n“Ah, Vronsky! When are you coming to the regiment? We can’t let you off\\nwithout a supper. You’re one of the old set,” said the colonel of his\\nregiment.\\n\\n“I can’t stop, awfully sorry, another time,” said Vronsky, and he ran\\nupstairs towards his brother’s box.\\n\\nThe old countess, Vronsky’s mother, with her steel-gray curls, was in\\nhis brother’s box. Varya with the young Princess Sorokina met him in\\nthe corridor.\\n\\nLeaving the Princess Sorokina with her mother, Varya held out her hand\\nto her brother-in-law, and began immediately to speak of what\\ninterested him. She was more excited than he had ever seen her.\\n\\n“I think it’s mean and hateful, and Madame Kartasova had no right to do\\nit. Madame Karenina....” she began.\\n\\n“But what is it? I don’t know.”\\n\\n“What? you’ve not heard?”\\n\\n“You know I should be the last person to hear of it.”\\n\\n“There isn’t a more spiteful creature than that Madame Kartasova!”\\n\\n“But what did she do?”\\n\\n“My husband told me.... She has insulted Madame Karenina. Her husband\\nbegan talking to her across the box, and Madame Kartasova made a scene.\\nShe said something aloud, he says, something insulting, and went away.”\\n\\n“Count, your maman is asking for you,” said the young Princess\\nSorokina, peeping out of the door of the box.\\n\\n“I’ve been expecting you all the while,” said his mother, smiling\\nsarcastically. “You were nowhere to be seen.”\\n\\nHer son saw that she could not suppress a smile of delight.\\n\\n“Good evening, maman. I have come to you,” he said coldly.\\n\\n“Why aren’t you going to _faire la cour à Madame Karenina?_” she went\\non, when Princess Sorokina had moved away. “_Elle fait sensation. On\\noublie la Patti pour elle_.”\\n\\n“Maman, I have asked you not to say anything to me of that,” he\\nanswered, scowling.\\n\\n“I’m only saying what everyone’s saying.”\\n\\nVronsky made no reply, and saying a few words to Princess Sorokina, he\\nwent away. At the door he met his brother.\\n\\n“Ah, Alexey!” said his brother. “How disgusting! Idiot of a woman,\\nnothing else.... I wanted to go straight to her. Let’s go together.”\\n\\nVronsky did not hear him. With rapid steps he went downstairs; he felt\\nthat he must do something, but he did not know what. Anger with her for\\nhaving put herself and him in such a false position, together with pity\\nfor her suffering, filled his heart. He went down, and made straight\\nfor Anna’s box. At her box stood Stremov, talking to her.\\n\\n“There are no more tenors. _Le moule en est brisé!_”\\n\\nVronsky bowed to her and stopped to greet Stremov.\\n\\n“You came in late, I think, and have missed the best song,” Anna said\\nto Vronsky, glancing ironically, he thought, at him.\\n\\n“I am a poor judge of music,” he said, looking sternly at her.\\n\\n“Like Prince Yashvin,” she said smiling, “who considers that Patti\\nsings too loud.”\\n\\n“Thank you,” she said, her little hand in its long glove taking the\\nplaybill Vronsky picked up, and suddenly at that instant her lovely\\nface quivered. She got up and went into the interior of the box.\\n\\nNoticing in the next act that her box was empty, Vronsky, rousing\\nindignant “hushes” in the silent audience, went out in the middle of a\\nsolo and drove home.\\n\\nAnna was already at home. When Vronsky went up to her, she was in the\\nsame dress as she had worn at the theater. She was sitting in the first\\narmchair against the wall, looking straight before her. She looked at\\nhim, and at once resumed her former position.\\n\\n“Anna,” he said.\\n\\n“You, you are to blame for everything!” she cried, with tears of\\ndespair and hatred in her voice, getting up.\\n\\n“I begged, I implored you not to go, I knew it would be unpleasant....”\\n\\n“Unpleasant!” she cried—“hideous! As long as I live I shall never\\nforget it. She said it was a disgrace to sit beside me.”\\n\\n“A silly woman’s chatter,” he said: “but why risk it, why provoke?...”\\n\\n“I hate your calm. You ought not to have brought me to this. If you had\\nloved me....”\\n\\n“Anna! How does the question of my love come in?”\\n\\n“Oh, if you loved me, as I love, if you were tortured as I am!...” she\\nsaid, looking at him with an expression of terror.\\n\\nHe was sorry for her, and angry notwithstanding. He assured her of his\\nlove because he saw that this was the only means of soothing her, and\\nhe did not reproach her in words, but in his heart he reproached her.\\n\\nAnd the asseverations of his love, which seemed to him so vulgar that\\nhe was ashamed to utter them, she drank in eagerly, and gradually\\nbecame calmer. The next day, completely reconciled, they left for the\\ncountry.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPART SIX 1\\n\\n\\nDarya Alexandrovna spent the summer with her children at Pokrovskoe, at\\nher sister Kitty Levin’s. The house on her own estate was quite in\\nruins, and Levin and his wife had persuaded her to spend the summer\\nwith them. Stepan Arkadyevitch greatly approved of the arrangement. He\\nsaid he was very sorry his official duties prevented him from spending\\nthe summer in the country with his family, which would have been the\\ngreatest happiness for him; and remaining in Moscow, he came down to\\nthe country from time to time for a day or two. Besides the Oblonskys,\\nwith all their children and their governess, the old princess too came\\nto stay that summer with the Levins, as she considered it her duty to\\nwatch over her inexperienced daughter in her _interesting condition_.\\nMoreover, Varenka, Kitty’s friend abroad, kept her promise to come to\\nKitty when she was married, and stayed with her friend. All of these\\nwere friends or relations of Levin’s wife. And though he liked them\\nall, he rather regretted his own Levin world and ways, which was\\nsmothered by this influx of the “Shtcherbatsky element,” as he called\\nit to himself. Of his own relations there stayed with him only Sergey\\nIvanovitch, but he too was a man of the Koznishev and not the Levin\\nstamp, so that the Levin spirit was utterly obliterated.\\n\\nIn the Levins’ house, so long deserted, there were now so many people\\nthat almost all the rooms were occupied, and almost every day it\\nhappened that the old princess, sitting down to table, counted them all\\nover, and put the thirteenth grandson or granddaughter at a separate\\ntable. And Kitty, with her careful housekeeping, had no little trouble\\nto get all the chickens, turkeys, and geese, of which so many were\\nneeded to satisfy the summer appetites of the visitors and children.\\n\\nThe whole family were sitting at dinner. Dolly’s children, with their\\ngoverness and Varenka, were making plans for going to look for\\nmushrooms. Sergey Ivanovitch, who was looked up to by all the party for\\nhis intellect and learning, with a respect that almost amounted to awe,\\nsurprised everyone by joining in the conversation about mushrooms.\\n\\n“Take me with you. I am very fond of picking mushrooms,” he said,\\nlooking at Varenka; “I think it’s a very nice occupation.”\\n\\n“Oh, we shall be delighted,” answered Varenka, coloring a little. Kitty\\nexchanged meaningful glances with Dolly. The proposal of the learned\\nand intellectual Sergey Ivanovitch to go looking for mushrooms with\\nVarenka confirmed certain theories of Kitty’s with which her mind had\\nbeen very busy of late. She made haste to address some remark to her\\nmother, so that her look should not be noticed. After dinner Sergey\\nIvanovitch sat with his cup of coffee at the drawing-room window, and\\nwhile he took part in a conversation he had begun with his brother, he\\nwatched the door through which the children would start on the\\nmushroom-picking expedition. Levin was sitting in the window near his\\nbrother.\\n\\nKitty stood beside her husband, evidently awaiting the end of a\\nconversation that had no interest for her, in order to tell him\\nsomething.\\n\\n“You have changed in many respects since your marriage, and for the\\nbetter,” said Sergey Ivanovitch, smiling to Kitty, and obviously little\\ninterested in the conversation, “but you have remained true to your\\npassion for defending the most paradoxical theories.”\\n\\n“Katya, it’s not good for you to stand,” her husband said to her,\\nputting a chair for her and looking significantly at her.\\n\\n“Oh, and there’s no time either,” added Sergey Ivanovitch, seeing the\\nchildren running out.\\n\\nAt the head of them all Tanya galloped sideways, in her tightly-drawn\\nstockings, and waving a basket and Sergey Ivanovitch’s hat, she ran\\nstraight up to him.\\n\\nBoldly running up to Sergey Ivanovitch with shining eyes, so like her\\nfather’s fine eyes, she handed him his hat and made as though she would\\nput it on for him, softening her freedom by a shy and friendly smile.\\n\\n“Varenka’s waiting,” she said, carefully putting his hat on, seeing\\nfrom Sergey Ivanovitch’s smile that she might do so.\\n\\nVarenka was standing at the door, dressed in a yellow print gown, with\\na white kerchief on her head.\\n\\n“I’m coming, I’m coming, Varvara Andreevna,” said Sergey Ivanovitch,\\nfinishing his cup of coffee, and putting into their separate pockets\\nhis handkerchief and cigar-case.\\n\\n“And how sweet my Varenka is! eh?” said Kitty to her husband, as soon\\nas Sergey Ivanovitch rose. She spoke so that Sergey Ivanovitch could\\nhear, and it was clear that she meant him to do so. “And how\\ngood-looking she is—such a refined beauty! Varenka!” Kitty shouted.\\n“Shall you be in the mill copse? We’ll come out to you.”\\n\\n“You certainly forget your condition, Kitty,” said the old princess,\\nhurriedly coming out at the door. “You mustn’t shout like that.”\\n\\nVarenka, hearing Kitty’s voice and her mother’s reprimand, went with\\nlight, rapid steps up to Kitty. The rapidity of her movement, her\\nflushed and eager face, everything betrayed that something out of the\\ncommon was going on in her. Kitty knew what this was, and had been\\nwatching her intently. She called Varenka at that moment merely in\\norder mentally to give her a blessing for the important event which, as\\nKitty fancied, was bound to come to pass that day after dinner in the\\nwood.\\n\\n“Varenka, I should be very happy if a certain something were to\\nhappen,” she whispered as she kissed her.\\n\\n“And are you coming with us?” Varenka said to Levin in confusion,\\npretending not to have heard what had been said.\\n\\n“I am coming, but only as far as the threshing-floor, and there I shall\\nstop.”\\n\\n“Why, what do you want there?” said Kitty.\\n\\n“I must go to have a look at the new wagons, and to check the invoice,”\\nsaid Levin; “and where will you be?”\\n\\n“On the terrace 2\\n\\nOn the terrace were assembled all the ladies of the party. They always\\nliked sitting there after dinner, and that day they had work to do\\nthere too. Besides the sewing and knitting of baby clothes, with which\\nall of them were busy, that afternoon jam was being made on the terrace\\nby a method new to Agafea Mihalovna, without the addition of water.\\nKitty had introduced this new method, which had been in use in her\\nhome. Agafea Mihalovna, to whom the task of jam-making had always been\\nintrusted, considering that what had been done in the Levin household\\ncould not be amiss, had nevertheless put water with the strawberries,\\nmaintaining that the jam could not be made without it. She had been\\ncaught in the act, and was now making jam before everyone, and it was\\nto be proved to her conclusively that jam could be very well made\\nwithout water.\\n\\nAgafea Mihalovna, her face heated and angry, her hair untidy, and her\\nthin arms bare to the elbows, was turning the preserving-pan over the\\ncharcoal stove, looking darkly at the raspberries and devoutly hoping\\nthey would stick and not cook properly. The princess, conscious that\\nAgafea Mihalovna’s wrath must be chiefly directed against her, as the\\nperson responsible for the raspberry jam-making, tried to appear to be\\nabsorbed in other things and not interested in the jam, talked of other\\nmatters, but cast stealthy glances in the direction of the stove.\\n\\n“I always buy my maids’ dresses myself, of some cheap material,” the\\nprincess said, continuing the previous conversation. “Isn’t it time to\\nskim it, my dear?” she added, addressing Agafea Mihalovna. “There’s not\\nthe slightest need for you to do it, and it’s hot for you,” she said,\\nstopping Kitty.\\n\\n“I’ll do it,” said Dolly, and getting up, she carefully passed the\\nspoon over the frothing sugar, and from time to time shook off the\\nclinging jam from the spoon by knocking it on a plate that was covered\\nwith yellow-red scum and blood-colored syrup. “How they’ll enjoy this\\nat tea-time!” she thought of her children, remembering how she herself\\nas a child had wondered how it was the grown-up people did not eat what\\nwas best of all—the scum of the jam.\\n\\n“Stiva says it’s much better to give money.” Dolly took up meanwhile\\nthe weighty subject under discussion, what presents should be made to\\nservants. “But....”\\n\\n“Money’s out of the question!” the princess and Kitty exclaimed with\\none voice. “They appreciate a present....”\\n\\n“Well, last year, for instance, I bought our Matrona Semyenovna, not a\\npoplin, but something of that sort,” said the princess.\\n\\n“I remember she was wearing it on your nameday.”\\n\\n“A charming pattern—so simple and refined,—I should have liked it\\nmyself, if she hadn’t had it. Something like Varenka’s. So pretty and\\ninexpensive.”\\n\\n“Well, now I think it’s done,” said Dolly, dropping the syrup from the\\nspoon.\\n\\n“When it sets as it drops, it’s ready. Cook it a little longer, Agafea\\nMihalovna.”\\n\\n“The flies!” said Agafea Mihalovna angrily. “It’ll be just the same,”\\nshe added.\\n\\n“Ah! how sweet it is! don’t frighten it!” Kitty said suddenly, looking\\nat a sparrow that had settled on the step and was pecking at the center\\nof a raspberry.\\n\\n“Yes, but you keep a little further from the stove,” said her mother.\\n\\n“_À propos de Varenka_,” said Kitty, speaking in French, as they had\\nbeen doing all the while, so that Agafea Mihalovna should not\\nunderstand them, “you know, mamma, I somehow expect things to be\\nsettled today. You know what I mean. How splendid it would be!”\\n\\n“But what a famous matchmaker she is!” said Dolly. “How carefully and\\ncleverly she throws them together!...”\\n\\n“No; tell me, mamma, what do you think?”\\n\\n“Why, what is one to think? He” (_he_ meant Sergey Ivanovitch) “might\\nat any time have been a match for anyone in Russia; now, of course,\\nhe’s not quite a young man, still I know ever so many girls would be\\nglad to marry him even now.... She’s a very nice girl, but he\\nmight....”\\n\\n“Oh, no, mamma, do understand why, for him and for her too, nothing\\nbetter could be imagined. In the first place, she’s charming!” said\\nKitty, crooking one of her fingers.\\n\\n“He thinks her very attractive, that’s certain,” assented Dolly.\\n\\n“Then he occupies such a position in society that he has no need to\\nlook for either fortune or position in his wife. All he needs is a\\ngood, sweet wife—a restful one.”\\n\\n“Well, with her he would certainly be restful,” Dolly assented.\\n\\n“Thirdly, that she should love him. And so it is ... that is, it would\\nbe so splendid!... I look forward to seeing them coming out of the\\nforest—and everything settled. I shall see at once by their eyes. I\\nshould be so delighted! What do you think, Dolly?”\\n\\n“But don’t excite yourself. It’s not at all the thing for you to be\\nexcited,” said her mother.\\n\\n“Oh, I’m not excited, mamma. I fancy he will make her an offer today.”\\n\\n“Ah, that’s so strange, how and when a man makes an offer!... There is\\na sort of barrier, and all at once it’s broken down,” said Dolly,\\nsmiling pensively and recalling her past with Stepan Arkadyevitch.\\n\\n“Mamma, how did papa make you an offer?” Kitty asked suddenly.\\n\\n“There was nothing out of the way, it was very simple,” answered the\\nprincess, but her face beamed all over at the recollection.\\n\\n“Oh, but how was it? You loved him, anyway, before you were allowed to\\nspeak?”\\n\\nKitty felt a peculiar pleasure in being able now to talk to her mother\\non equal terms about those questions of such paramount interest in a\\nwoman’s life.\\n\\n“Of course I did; he had come to stay with us in the country.”\\n\\n“But how was it settled between you, mamma?”\\n\\n“You imagine, I dare say, that you invented something quite new? It’s\\nalways just the same: it was settled by the eyes, by smiles....”\\n\\n“How nicely you said that, mamma! It’s just by the eyes, by smiles that\\nit’s done,” Dolly assented.\\n\\n“But what words did he say?”\\n\\n“What did Kostya say to you?”\\n\\n“He wrote it in chalk. It was wonderful.... How long ago it seems!” she\\nsaid.\\n\\nAnd the three women all fell to musing on the same thing. Kitty was the\\nfirst to break the silence. She remembered all that last winter before\\nher marriage, and her passion for Vronsky.\\n\\n“There’s one thing ... that old love affair of Varenka’s,” she said, a\\nnatural chain of ideas bringing her to this point. “I should have liked\\nto say something to Sergey Ivanovitch, to prepare him. They’re all—all\\nmen, I mean,” she added, “awfully jealous over our past.”\\n\\n“Not all,” said Dolly. “You judge by your own husband. It makes him\\nmiserable even now to remember Vronsky. Eh? that’s true, isn’t it?”\\n\\n“Yes,” Kitty answered, a pensive smile in her eyes.\\n\\n“But I really don’t know,” the mother put in in defense of her motherly\\ncare of her daughter, “what there was in your past that could worry\\nhim? That Vronsky paid you attentions—that happens to every girl.”\\n\\n“Oh, yes, but we didn’t mean that,” Kitty said, flushing a little.\\n\\n“No, let me speak,” her mother went on, “why, you yourself would not\\nlet me have a talk to Vronsky. Don’t you remember?”\\n\\n“Oh, mamma!” said Kitty, with an expression of suffering.\\n\\n“There’s no keeping you young people in check nowadays.... Your\\nfriendship could not have gone beyond what was suitable. I should\\nmyself have called upon him to explain himself. But, my darling, it’s\\nnot right for you to be agitated. Please remember that, and calm\\nyourself.”\\n\\n“I’m perfectly calm, maman.”\\n\\n“How happy it was for Kitty that Anna came then,” said Dolly, “and how\\nunhappy for her. It turned out quite the opposite,” she said, struck by\\nher own ideas. “Then Anna was so happy, and Kitty thought herself\\nunhappy. Now it is just the opposite. I often think of her.”\\n\\n“A nice person to think about! Horrid, repulsive woman—no heart,” said\\nher mother, who could not forget that Kitty had married not Vronsky,\\nbut Levin.\\n\\n“What do you want to talk of it for?” Kitty said with annoyance. “I\\nnever think about it, and I don’t want to think of it.... And I don’t\\nwant to think of it,” she said, catching the sound of her husband’s\\nwell-known step on the steps of the terrace.\\n\\n“What’s that you don’t want to think about?” inquired Levin, coming\\nonto the terrace.\\n\\nBut no one answered him, and he did not repeat the question.\\n\\n“I’m sorry I’ve broken in on your feminine parliament,” he said,\\nlooking round on everyone discontentedly, and perceiving that they had\\nbeen talking of something which they would not talk about before him.\\n\\nFor a second he felt that he was sharing the feeling of Agafea\\nMihalovna, vexation at their making jam without water, and altogether\\nat the outside Shtcherbatsky element. He smiled, however, and went up\\nto Kitty.\\n\\n“Well, how are you?” he asked her, looking at her with the expression\\nwith which everyone looked at her now.\\n\\n“Oh, very well,” said Kitty, smiling, “and how have things gone with\\nyou?”\\n\\n“The wagons held three times as much as the old carts did. Well, are we\\ngoing for the children? I’ve ordered the horses to be put in.”\\n\\n“What! you want to take Kitty in the wagonette?” her mother said\\nreproachfully.\\n\\n“Yes, at a walking pace, princess.”\\n\\nLevin never called the princess “maman” as men often do call their\\nmothers-in-law, and the princess disliked his not doing so. But though\\nhe liked and respected the princess, Levin could not call her so\\nwithout a sense of profaning his feeling for his dead mother.\\n\\n“Come with us, maman,” said Kitty.\\n\\n“I don’t like to see such imprudence.”\\n\\n“Well, I’ll walk then, I’m so well.” Kitty got up and went to her\\nhusband and took his hand.\\n\\n“You may be well, but everything in moderation,” said the princess.\\n\\n“Well, Agafea Mihalovna, is the jam done?” said Levin, smiling to\\nAgafea Mihalovna, and trying to cheer her up. “Is it all right in the\\nnew way?”\\n\\n“I suppose it’s all right. For our notions it’s boiled too long.”\\n\\n“It’ll be all the better, Agafea Mihalovna, it won’t mildew, even\\nthough our ice has begun to thaw already, so that we’ve no cool cellar\\nto store it,” said Kitty, at once divining her husband’s motive, and\\naddressing the old housekeeper with the same feeling; “but your\\npickle’s so good, that mamma says she never tasted any like it,” she\\nadded, smiling, and putting her kerchief straight.\\n\\nAgafea Mihalovna looked angrily at Kitty.\\n\\n“You needn’t try to console me, mistress. I need only to look at you\\nwith him, and I feel happy,” she said, and something in the rough\\nfamiliarity of that _with him_ touched Kitty.\\n\\n“Come along with us to look for mushrooms, you will show us the best\\nplaces.” Agafea Mihalovna smiled and shook her head, as though to say:\\n“I should like to be angry with you too, but I can’t.”\\n\\n“Do it, please, by my receipt,” said the princess; “put some paper over\\nthe jam, and moisten it with a little rum, and without even ice, it\\nwill never go mildewy 3\\n\\nKitty was particularly glad of a chance of being alone with her\\nhusband, for she had noticed the shade of mortification that had passed\\nover his face—always so quick to reflect every feeling—at the moment\\nwhen he had come onto the terrace and asked what they were talking of,\\nand had got no answer.\\n\\nWhen they had set off on foot ahead of the others, and had come out of\\nsight of the house onto the beaten dusty road, marked with rusty wheels\\nand sprinkled with grains of corn, she clung faster to his arm and\\npressed it closer to her. He had quite forgotten the momentary\\nunpleasant impression, and alone with her he felt, now that the thought\\nof her approaching motherhood was never for a moment absent from his\\nmind, a new and delicious bliss, quite pure from all alloy of sense, in\\nthe being near to the woman he loved. There was no need of speech, yet\\nhe longed to hear the sound of her voice, which like her eyes had\\nchanged since she had been with child. In her voice, as in her eyes,\\nthere was that softness and gravity which is found in people\\ncontinually concentrated on some cherished pursuit.\\n\\n“So you’re not tired? Lean more on me,” said he.\\n\\n“No, I’m so glad of a chance of being alone with you, and I must own,\\nthough I’m happy with them, I do regret our winter evenings alone.”\\n\\n“That was good, but this is even better. Both are better,” he said,\\nsqueezing her hand.\\n\\n“Do you know what we were talking about when you came in?”\\n\\n“About jam?”\\n\\n“Oh, yes, about jam too; but afterwards, about how men make offers.”\\n\\n“Ah!” said Levin, listening more to the sound of her voice than to the\\nwords she was saying, and all the while paying attention to the road,\\nwhich passed now through the forest, and avoiding places where she\\nmight make a false step.\\n\\n“And about Sergey Ivanovitch and Varenka. You’ve noticed?... I’m very\\nanxious for it,” she went on. “What do you think about it?” And she\\npeeped into his face.\\n\\n“I don’t know what to think,” Levin answered, smiling. “Sergey seems\\nvery strange to me in that way. I told you, you know....”\\n\\n“Yes, that he was in love with that girl who died....”\\n\\n“That was when I was a child; I know about it from hearsay and\\ntradition. I remember him then. He was wonderfully sweet. But I’ve\\nwatched him since with women; he is friendly, some of them he likes,\\nbut one feels that to him they’re simply people, not women.”\\n\\n“Yes, but now with Varenka ... I fancy there’s something....”\\n\\n“Perhaps there is.... But one has to know him.... He’s a peculiar,\\nwonderful person. He lives a spiritual life only. He’s too pure, too\\nexalted a nature.”\\n\\n“Why? Would this lower him, then?”\\n\\n“No, but he’s so used to a spiritual life that he can’t reconcile\\nhimself with actual fact, and Varenka is after all fact.”\\n\\nLevin had grown used by now to uttering his thought boldly, without\\ntaking the trouble of clothing it in exact language. He knew that his\\nwife, in such moments of loving tenderness as now, would understand\\nwhat he meant to say from a hint, and she did understand him.\\n\\n“Yes, but there’s not so much of that actual fact about her as about\\nme. I can see that he would never have cared for me. She is altogether\\nspiritual.”\\n\\n“Oh, no, he is so fond of you, and I am always so glad when my people\\nlike you....”\\n\\n“Yes, he’s very nice to me; but....”\\n\\n“It’s not as it was with poor Nikolay ... you really cared for each\\nother,” Levin finished. “Why not speak of him?” he added. “I sometimes\\nblame myself for not; it ends in one’s forgetting. Ah, how terrible and\\ndear he was!... Yes, what were we talking about?” Levin said, after a\\npause.\\n\\n“You think he can’t fall in love,” said Kitty, translating into her own\\nlanguage.\\n\\n“It’s not so much that he can’t fall in love,” Levin said, smiling,\\n“but he has not the weakness necessary.... I’ve always envied him, and\\neven now, when I’m so happy, I still envy him.”\\n\\n“You envy him for not being able to fall in love?”\\n\\n“I envy him for being better than I,” said Levin. “He does not live for\\nhimself. His whole life is subordinated to his duty. And that’s why he\\ncan be calm and contented.”\\n\\n“And you?” Kitty asked, with an ironical and loving smile.\\n\\nShe could never have explained the chain of thought that made her\\nsmile; but the last link in it was that her husband, in exalting his\\nbrother and abasing himself, was not quite sincere. Kitty knew that\\nthis insincerity came from his love for his brother, from his sense of\\nshame at being too happy, and above all from his unflagging craving to\\nbe better—she loved it in him, and so she smiled.\\n\\n“And you? What are you dissatisfied with?” she asked, with the same\\nsmile.\\n\\nHer disbelief in his self-dissatisfaction delighted him, and\\nunconsciously he tried to draw her into giving utterance to the grounds\\nof her disbelief.\\n\\n“I am happy, but dissatisfied with myself....” he said.\\n\\n“Why, how can you be dissatisfied with yourself if you are happy?”\\n\\n“Well, how shall I say?... In my heart I really care for nothing\\nwhatever but that you should not stumble—see? Oh, but really you\\nmustn’t skip about like that!” he cried, breaking off to scold her for\\ntoo agile a movement in stepping over a branch that lay in the path.\\n“But when I think about myself, and compare myself with others,\\nespecially with my brother, I feel I’m a poor creature.”\\n\\n“But in what way?” Kitty pursued with the same smile. “Don’t you too\\nwork for others? What about your co-operative settlement, and your work\\non the estate, and your book?...”\\n\\n“Oh, but I feel, and particularly just now—it’s your fault,” he said,\\npressing her hand—“that all that doesn’t count. I do it in a way\\nhalfheartedly. If I could care for all that as I care for you!...\\nInstead of that, I do it in these days like a task that is set me.”\\n\\n“Well, what would you say about papa?” asked Kitty. “Is he a poor\\ncreature then, as he does nothing for the public good?”\\n\\n“He?—no! But then one must have the simplicity, the\\nstraightforwardness, the goodness of your father: and I haven’t got\\nthat. I do nothing, and I fret about it. It’s all your doing. Before\\nthere was you—and _this_ too,” he added with a glance towards her waist\\nthat she understood—“I put all my energies into work; now I can’t, and\\nI’m ashamed; I do it just as though it were a task set me, I’m\\npretending....”\\n\\n“Well, but would you like to change this minute with Sergey\\nIvanovitch?” said Kitty. “Would you like to do this work for the\\ngeneral good, and to love the task set you, as he does, and nothing\\nelse?”\\n\\n“Of course not,” said Levin. “But I’m so happy that I don’t understand\\nanything. So you think he’ll make her an offer today?” he added after a\\nbrief silence.\\n\\n“I think so, and I don’t think so. Only, I’m awfully anxious for it.\\nHere, wait a minute.” She stooped down and picked a wild camomile at\\nthe edge of the path. “Come, count: he does propose, he doesn’t,” she\\nsaid, giving him the flower.\\n\\n“He does, he doesn’t,” said Levin, tearing off the white petals.\\n\\n“No, no!” Kitty, snatching at his hand, stopped him. She had been\\nwatching his fingers with interest. “You picked off two.”\\n\\n“Oh, but see, this little one shan’t count to make up,” said Levin,\\ntearing off a little half-grown petal. “Here’s the wagonette overtaking\\nus.”\\n\\n“Aren’t you tired, Kitty?” called the princess.\\n\\n“Not in the least.”\\n\\n“If you are you can get in, as the horses are quiet and walking.”\\n\\nBut it was not worth while to get in, they were quite near the place,\\nand all walked on together 4\\n\\nVarenka, with her white kerchief on her black hair, surrounded by the\\nchildren, gaily and good-humoredly looking after them, and at the same\\ntime visibly excited at the possibility of receiving a declaration from\\nthe man she cared for, was very attractive. Sergey Ivanovitch walked\\nbeside her, and never left off admiring her. Looking at her, he\\nrecalled all the delightful things he had heard from her lips, all the\\ngood he knew about her, and became more and more conscious that the\\nfeeling he had for her was something special that he had felt long,\\nlong ago, and only once, in his early youth. The feeling of happiness\\nin being near her continually grew, and at last reached such a point\\nthat, as he put a huge, slender-stalked agaric fungus in her basket, he\\nlooked straight into her face, and noticing the flush of glad and\\nalarmed excitement that overspread her face, he was confused himself,\\nand smiled to her in silence a smile that said too much.\\n\\n“If so,” he said to himself, “I ought to think it over and make up my\\nmind, and not give way like a boy to the impulse of a moment.”\\n\\n“I’m going to pick by myself apart from all the rest, or else my\\nefforts will make no show,” he said, and he left the edge of the forest\\nwhere they were walking on low silky grass between old birch trees\\nstanding far apart, and went more into the heart of the wood, where\\nbetween the white birch trunks there were gray trunks of aspen and dark\\nbushes of hazel. Walking some forty paces away, Sergey Ivanovitch,\\nknowing he was out of sight, stood still behind a bushy spindle-tree in\\nfull flower with its rosy red catkins. It was perfectly still all round\\nhim. Only overhead in the birches under which he stood, the flies, like\\na swarm of bees, buzzed unceasingly, and from time to time the\\nchildren’s voices were floated across to him. All at once he heard, not\\nfar from the edge of the wood, the sound of Varenka’s contralto voice,\\ncalling Grisha, and a smile of delight passed over Sergey Ivanovitch’s\\nface. Conscious of this smile, he shook his head disapprovingly at his\\nown condition, and taking out a cigar, he began lighting it. For a long\\nwhile he could not get a match to light against the trunk of a birch\\ntree. The soft scales of the white bark rubbed off the phosphorus, and\\nthe light went out. At last one of the matches burned, and the fragrant\\ncigar smoke, hovering uncertainly in flat, wide coils, stretched away\\nforwards and upwards over a bush under the overhanging branches of a\\nbirch tree. Watching the streak of smoke, Sergey Ivanovitch walked\\ngently on, deliberating on his position.\\n\\n“Why not?” he thought. “If it were only a passing fancy or a passion,\\nif it were only this attraction—this mutual attraction (I can call it a\\n_mutual_ attraction), but if I felt that it was in contradiction with\\nthe whole bent of my life—if I felt that in giving way to this\\nattraction I should be false to my vocation and my duty ... but it’s\\nnot so. The only thing I can say against it is that, when I lost Marie,\\nI said to myself that I would remain faithful to her memory. That’s the\\nonly thing I can say against my feeling.... That’s a great thing,”\\nSergey Ivanovitch said to himself, feeling at the same time that this\\nconsideration had not the slightest importance for him personally, but\\nwould only perhaps detract from his romantic character in the eyes of\\nothers. “But apart from that, however much I searched, I should never\\nfind anything to say against my feeling. If I were choosing by\\nconsiderations of suitability alone, I could not have found anything\\nbetter.”\\n\\nHowever many women and girls he thought of whom he knew, he could not\\nthink of a girl who united to such a degree all, positively all, the\\nqualities he would wish to see in his wife. She had all the charm and\\nfreshness of youth, but she was not a child; and if she loved him, she\\nloved him consciously as a woman ought to love; that was one thing.\\nAnother point: she was not only far from being worldly, but had an\\nunmistakable distaste for worldly society, and at the same time she\\nknew the world, and had all the ways of a woman of the best society,\\nwhich were absolutely essential to Sergey Ivanovitch’s conception of\\nthe woman who was to share his life. Thirdly: she was religious, and\\nnot like a child, unconsciously religious and good, as Kitty, for\\nexample, was, but her life was founded on religious principles. Even in\\ntrifling matters, Sergey Ivanovitch found in her all that he wanted in\\nhis wife: she was poor and alone in the world, so she would not bring\\nwith her a mass of relations and their influence into her husband’s\\nhouse, as he saw now in Kitty’s case. She would owe everything to her\\nhusband, which was what he had always desired too for his future family\\nlife. And this girl, who united all these qualities, loved him. He was\\na modest man, but he could not help seeing it. And he loved her. There\\nwas one consideration against it—his age. But he came of a long-lived\\nfamily, he had not a single gray hair, no one would have taken him for\\nforty, and he remembered Varenka’s saying that it was only in Russia\\nthat men of fifty thought themselves old, and that in France a man of\\nfifty considers himself _dans la force de l’âge_, while a man of forty\\nis _un jeune homme_. But what did the mere reckoning of years matter\\nwhen he felt as young in heart as he had been twenty years ago? Was it\\nnot youth to feel as he felt now, when coming from the other side to\\nthe edge of the wood he saw in the glowing light of the slanting\\nsunbeams the gracious figure of Varenka in her yellow gown with her\\nbasket, walking lightly by the trunk of an old birch tree, and when\\nthis impression of the sight of Varenka blended so harmoniously with\\nthe beauty of the view, of the yellow oatfield lying bathed in the\\nslanting sunshine, and beyond it the distant ancient forest flecked\\nwith yellow and melting into the blue of the distance? His heart\\nthrobbed joyously. A softened feeling came over him. He felt that he\\nhad made up his mind. Varenka, who had just crouched down to pick a\\nmushroom, rose with a supple movement and looked round. Flinging away\\nthe cigar, Sergey Ivanovitch advanced with resolute steps towards her 5\\n\\n“Varvara Andreevna, when I was very young, I set before myself the\\nideal of the woman I loved and should be happy to call my wife. I have\\nlived through a long life, and now for the first time I have met what I\\nsought—in you. I love you, and offer you my hand.”\\n\\nSergey Ivanovitch was saying this to himself while he was ten paces\\nfrom Varvara. Kneeling down, with her hands over the mushrooms to guard\\nthem from Grisha, she was calling little Masha.\\n\\n“Come here, little ones! There are so many!” she was saying in her\\nsweet, deep voice.\\n\\nSeeing Sergey Ivanovitch approaching, she did not get up and did not\\nchange her position, but everything told him that she felt his presence\\nand was glad of it.\\n\\n“Well, did you find some?” she asked from under the white kerchief,\\nturning her handsome, gently smiling face to him.\\n\\n“Not one,” said Sergey Ivanovitch. “Did you?”\\n\\nShe did not answer, busy with the children who thronged about her.\\n\\n“That one too, near the twig,” she pointed out to little Masha a little\\nfungus, split in half across its rosy cap by the dry grass from under\\nwhich it thrust itself. Varenka got up while Masha picked the fungus,\\nbreaking it into two white halves. “This brings back my childhood,” she\\nadded, moving apart from the children beside Sergey Ivanovitch.\\n\\nThey walked on for some steps in silence. Varenka saw that he wanted to\\nspeak; she guessed of what, and felt faint with joy and panic. They had\\nwalked so far away that no one could hear them now, but still he did\\nnot begin to speak. It would have been better for Varenka to be silent.\\nAfter a silence it would have been easier for them to say what they\\nwanted to say than after talking about mushrooms. But against her own\\nwill, as it were accidentally, Varenka said:\\n\\n“So you found nothing? In the middle of the wood there are always\\nfewer, though.” Sergey Ivanovitch sighed and made no answer. He was\\nannoyed that she had spoken about the mushrooms. He wanted to bring her\\nback to the first words she had uttered about her childhood; but after\\na pause of some length, as though against his own will, he made an\\nobservation in response to her last words.\\n\\n“I have heard that the white edible funguses are found principally at\\nthe edge of the wood, though I can’t tell them apart.”\\n\\nSome minutes more passed, they moved still further away from the\\nchildren, and were quite alone. Varenka’s heart throbbed so that she\\nheard it beating, and felt that she was turning red and pale and red\\nagain.\\n\\nTo be the wife of a man like Koznishev, after her position with Madame\\nStahl, was to her imagination the height of happiness. Besides, she was\\nalmost certain that she was in love with him. And this moment it would\\nhave to be decided. She felt frightened. She dreaded both his speaking\\nand his not speaking.\\n\\nNow or never it must be said—that Sergey Ivanovitch felt too.\\nEverything in the expression, the flushed cheeks and the downcast eyes\\nof Varenka betrayed a painful suspense. Sergey Ivanovitch saw it and\\nfelt sorry for her. He felt even that to say nothing now would be a\\nslight to her. Rapidly in his own mind he ran over all the arguments in\\nsupport of his decision. He even said over to himself the words in\\nwhich he meant to put his offer, but instead of those words, some\\nutterly unexpected reflection that occurred to him made him ask:\\n\\n“What is the difference between the ‘birch’ mushroom and the ‘white’\\nmushroom?”\\n\\nVarenka’s lips quivered with emotion as she answered:\\n\\n“In the top part there is scarcely any difference, it’s in the stalk.”\\n\\nAnd as soon as these words were uttered, both he and she felt that it\\nwas over, that what was to have been said would not be said; and their\\nemotion, which had up to then been continually growing more intense,\\nbegan to subside.\\n\\n“The birch mushroom’s stalk suggests a dark man’s chin after two days\\nwithout shaving,” said Sergey Ivanovitch, speaking quite calmly now.\\n\\n“Yes, that’s true,” answered Varenka smiling, and unconsciously the\\ndirection of their walk changed. They began to turn towards the\\nchildren. Varenka felt both sore and ashamed; at the same time she had\\na sense of relief.\\n\\nWhen he had got home again and went over the whole subject, Sergey\\nIvanovitch thought his previous decision had been a mistaken one. He\\ncould not be false to the memory of Marie.\\n\\n“Gently, children, gently!” Levin shouted quite angrily to the\\nchildren, standing before his wife to protect her when the crowd of\\nchildren flew with shrieks of delight to meet them.\\n\\nBehind the children Sergey Ivanovitch and Varenka walked out of the\\nwood. Kitty had no need to ask Varenka; she saw from the calm and\\nsomewhat crestfallen faces of both that her plans had not come off.\\n\\n“Well?” her husband questioned her as they were going home again.\\n\\n“It doesn’t bite,” said Kitty, her smile and manner of speaking\\nrecalling her father, a likeness Levin often noticed with pleasure.\\n\\n“How doesn’t bite?”\\n\\n“I’ll show you,” she said, taking her husband’s hand, lifting it to her\\nmouth, and just faintly brushing it with closed lips. “Like a kiss on a\\npriest’s hand.”\\n\\n“Which didn’t it bite with?” he said, laughing.\\n\\n“Both. But it should have been like this....”\\n\\n“There are some peasants coming....”\\n\\n“Oh, they didn’t see 6\\n\\nDuring the time of the children’s tea the grown-up people sat in the\\nbalcony and talked as though nothing had happened, though they all,\\nespecially Sergey Ivanovitch and Varenka, were very well aware that\\nthere had happened an event which, though negative, was of very great\\nimportance. They both had the same feeling, rather like that of a\\nschoolboy after an examination, which has left him in the same class or\\nshut him out of the school forever. Everyone present, feeling too that\\nsomething had happened, talked eagerly about extraneous subjects. Levin\\nand Kitty were particularly happy and conscious of their love that\\nevening. And their happiness in their love seemed to imply a\\ndisagreeable slur on those who would have liked to feel the same and\\ncould not—and they felt a prick of conscience.\\n\\n“Mark my words, Alexander will not come,” said the old princess.\\n\\nThat evening they were expecting Stepan Arkadyevitch to come down by\\ntrain, and the old prince had written that possibly he might come too.\\n\\n“And I know why,” the princess went on; “he says that young people\\nought to be left alone for a while at first.”\\n\\n“But papa has left us alone. We’ve never seen him,” said Kitty.\\n“Besides, we’re not young people!—we’re old, married people by now.”\\n\\n“Only if he doesn’t come, I shall say good-bye to you children,” said\\nthe princess, sighing mournfully.\\n\\n“What nonsense, mamma!” both the daughters fell upon her at once.\\n\\n“How do you suppose he is feeling? Why, now....”\\n\\nAnd suddenly there was an unexpected quiver in the princess’s voice.\\nHer daughters were silent, and looked at one another. “Maman always\\nfinds something to be miserable about,” they said in that glance. They\\ndid not know that happy as the princess was in her daughter’s house,\\nand useful as she felt herself to be there, she had been extremely\\nmiserable, both on her own account and her husband’s, ever since they\\nhad married their last and favorite daughter, and the old home had been\\nleft empty.\\n\\n“What is it, Agafea Mihalovna?” Kitty asked suddenly of Agafea\\nMihalovna, who was standing with a mysterious air, and a face full of\\nmeaning.\\n\\n“About supper.”\\n\\n“Well, that’s right,” said Dolly; “you go and arrange about it, and\\nI’ll go and hear Grisha repeat his lesson, or else he will have nothing\\ndone all day.”\\n\\n“That’s my lesson! No, Dolly, I’m going,” said Levin, jumping up.\\n\\nGrisha, who was by now at a high school, had to go over the lessons of\\nthe term in the summer holidays. Darya Alexandrovna, who had been\\nstudying Latin with her son in Moscow before, had made it a rule on\\ncoming to the Levins’ to go over with him, at least once a day, the\\nmost difficult lessons of Latin and arithmetic. Levin had offered to\\ntake her place, but the mother, having once overheard Levin’s lesson,\\nand noticing that it was not given exactly as the teacher in Moscow had\\ngiven it, said resolutely, though with much embarrassment and anxiety\\nnot to mortify Levin, that they must keep strictly to the book as the\\nteacher had done, and that she had better undertake it again herself.\\nLevin was amazed both at Stepan Arkadyevitch, who, by neglecting his\\nduty, threw upon the mother the supervision of studies of which she had\\nno comprehension, and at the teachers for teaching the children so\\nbadly. But he promised his sister-in-law to give the lessons exactly as\\nshe wished. And he went on teaching Grisha, not in his own way, but by\\nthe book, and so took little interest in it, and often forgot the hour\\nof the lesson. So it had been today.\\n\\n“No, I’m going, Dolly, you sit still,” he said. “We’ll do it all\\nproperly, like the book. Only when Stiva comes, and we go out shooting,\\nthen we shall have to miss it.”\\n\\nAnd Levin went to Grisha.\\n\\nVarenka was saying the same thing to Kitty. Even in the happy,\\nwell-ordered household of the Levins Varenka had succeeded in making\\nherself useful.\\n\\n“I’ll see to the supper, you sit still,” she said, and got up to go to\\nAgafea Mihalovna.\\n\\n“Yes, yes, most likely they’ve not been able to get chickens. If so,\\nours....”\\n\\n“Agafea Mihalovna and I will see about it,” and Varenka vanished with\\nher.\\n\\n“What a nice girl!” said the princess.\\n\\n“Not nice, maman; she’s an exquisite girl; there’s no one else like\\nher.”\\n\\n“So you are expecting Stepan Arkadyevitch today?” said Sergey\\nIvanovitch, evidently not disposed to pursue the conversation about\\nVarenka. “It would be difficult to find two sons-in-law more unlike\\nthan yours,” he said with a subtle smile. “One all movement, only\\nliving in society, like a fish in water; the other our Kostya, lively,\\nalert, quick in everything, but as soon as he is in society, he either\\nsinks into apathy, or struggles helplessly like a fish on land.”\\n\\n“Yes, he’s very heedless,” said the princess, addressing Sergey\\nIvanovitch. “I’ve been meaning, indeed, to ask you to tell him that\\nit’s out of the question for her” (she indicated Kitty) “to stay here;\\nthat she positively must come to Moscow. He talks of getting a doctor\\ndown....”\\n\\n“Maman, he’ll do everything; he has agreed to everything,” Kitty said,\\nangry with her mother for appealing to Sergey Ivanovitch to judge in\\nsuch a matter.\\n\\nIn the middle of their conversation they heard the snorting of horses\\nand the sound of wheels on the gravel. Dolly had not time to get up to\\ngo and meet her husband, when from the window of the room below, where\\nGrisha was having his lesson, Levin leaped out and helped Grisha out\\nafter him.\\n\\n“It’s Stiva!” Levin shouted from under the balcony. “We’ve finished,\\nDolly, don’t be afraid!” he added, and started running like a boy to\\nmeet the carriage.\\n\\n“_Is ea id, ejus, ejus, ejus!_” shouted Grisha, skipping along the\\navenue.\\n\\n“And someone else too! Papa, of course!” cried Levin, stopping at the\\nentrance of the avenue. “Kitty, don’t come down the steep staircase, go\\nround.”\\n\\nBut Levin had been mistaken in taking the person sitting in the\\ncarriage for the old prince. As he got nearer to the carriage he saw\\nbeside Stepan Arkadyevitch not the prince but a handsome, stout young\\nman in a Scotch cap, with long ends of ribbon behind. This was Vassenka\\nVeslovsky, a distant cousin of the Shtcherbatskys, a brilliant young\\ngentleman in Petersburg and Moscow society. “A capital fellow, and a\\nkeen sportsman,” as Stepan Arkadyevitch said, introducing him.\\n\\nNot a whit abashed by the disappointment caused by his having come in\\nplace of the old prince, Veslovsky greeted Levin gaily, claiming\\nacquaintance with him in the past, and snatching up Grisha into the\\ncarriage, lifted him over the pointer that Stepan Arkadyevitch had\\nbrought with him.\\n\\nLevin did not get into the carriage, but walked behind. He was rather\\nvexed at the non-arrival of the old prince, whom he liked more and more\\nthe more he saw of him, and also at the arrival of this Vassenka\\nVeslovsky, a quite uncongenial and superfluous person. He seemed to him\\nstill more uncongenial and superfluous when, on approaching the steps\\nwhere the whole party, children and grown-up, were gathered together in\\nmuch excitement, Levin saw Vassenka Veslovsky, with a particularly warm\\nand gallant air, kissing Kitty’s hand.\\n\\n“Your wife and I are cousins and very old friends,” said Vassenka\\nVeslovsky, once more shaking Levin’s hand with great warmth.\\n\\n“Well, are there plenty of birds?” Stepan Arkadyevitch said to Levin,\\nhardly leaving time for everyone to utter their greetings. “We’ve come\\nwith the most savage intentions. Why, maman, they’ve not been in Moscow\\nsince! Look, Tanya, here’s something for you! Get it, please, it’s in\\nthe carriage, behind!” he talked in all directions. “How pretty you’ve\\ngrown, Dolly,” he said to his wife, once more kissing her hand, holding\\nit in one of his, and patting it with the other.\\n\\nLevin, who a minute before had been in the happiest frame of mind, now\\nlooked darkly at everyone, and everything displeased him.\\n\\n“Who was it he kissed yesterday with those lips?” he thought, looking\\nat Stepan Arkadyevitch’s tender demonstrations to his wife. He looked\\nat Dolly, and he did not like her either.\\n\\n“She doesn’t believe in his love. So what is she so pleased about?\\nRevolting!” thought Levin.\\n\\nHe looked at the princess, who had been so dear to him a minute before,\\nand he did not like the manner in which she welcomed this Vassenka,\\nwith his ribbons, just as though she were in her own house.\\n\\nEven Sergey Ivanovitch, who had come out too onto the steps, seemed to\\nhim unpleasant with the show of cordiality with which he met Stepan\\nArkadyevitch, though Levin knew that his brother neither liked nor\\nrespected Oblonsky.\\n\\nAnd Varenka, even she seemed hateful, with her air _sainte nitouche_\\nmaking the acquaintance of this gentleman, while all the while she was\\nthinking of nothing but getting married.\\n\\nAnd more hateful than anyone was Kitty for falling in with the tone of\\ngaiety with which this gentleman regarded his visit in the country, as\\nthough it were a holiday for himself and everyone else. And, above all,\\nunpleasant was that particular smile with which she responded to his\\nsmile.\\n\\nNoisily talking, they all went into the house; but as soon as they were\\nall seated, Levin turned and went out.\\n\\nKitty saw something was wrong with her husband. She tried to seize a\\nmoment to speak to him alone, but he made haste to get away from her,\\nsaying he was wanted at the counting-house. It was long since his own\\nwork on the estate had seemed to him so important as at that moment.\\n“It’s all holiday for them,” he thought; “but these are no holiday\\nmatters, they won’t wait, and there’s no living without them 7\\n\\nLevin came back to the house only when they sent to summon him to\\nsupper. On the stairs were standing Kitty and Agafea Mihalovna,\\nconsulting about wines for supper.\\n\\n“But why are you making all this fuss? Have what we usually do.”\\n\\n“No, Stiva doesn’t drink ... Kostya, stop, what’s the matter?” Kitty\\nbegan, hurrying after him, but he strode ruthlessly away to the\\ndining-room without waiting for her, and at once joined in the lively\\ngeneral conversation which was being maintained there by Vassenka\\nVeslovsky and Stepan Arkadyevitch.\\n\\n“Well, what do you say, are we going shooting tomorrow?” said Stepan\\nArkadyevitch.\\n\\n“Please, do let’s go,” said Veslovsky, moving to another chair, where\\nhe sat down sideways, with one fat leg crossed under him.\\n\\n“I shall be delighted, we will go. And have you had any shooting yet\\nthis year?” said Levin to Veslovsky, looking intently at his leg, but\\nspeaking with that forced amiability that Kitty knew so well in him,\\nand that was so out of keeping with him. “I can’t answer for our\\nfinding grouse, but there are plenty of snipe. Only we ought to start\\nearly. You’re not tired? Aren’t you tired, Stiva?”\\n\\n“Me tired? I’ve never been tired yet. Suppose we stay up all night.\\nLet’s go for a walk!”\\n\\n“Yes, really, let’s not go to bed at all! Capital!” Veslovsky chimed\\nin.\\n\\n“Oh, we all know you can do without sleep, and keep other people up\\ntoo,” Dolly said to her husband, with that faint note of irony in her\\nvoice which she almost always had now with her husband. “But to my\\nthinking, it’s time for bed now.... I’m going, I don’t want supper.”\\n\\n“No, do stay a little, Dolly,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, going round to\\nher side behind the table where they were having supper. “I’ve so much\\nstill to tell you.”\\n\\n“Nothing really, I suppose.”\\n\\n“Do you know Veslovsky has been at Anna’s, and he’s going to them\\nagain? You know they’re hardly fifty miles from you, and I too must\\ncertainly go over there. Veslovsky, come here!”\\n\\nVassenka crossed over to the ladies, and sat down beside Kitty.\\n\\n“Ah, do tell me, please; you have stayed with her? How was she?” Darya\\nAlexandrovna appealed to him.\\n\\nLevin was left at the other end of the table, and though never pausing\\nin his conversation with the princess and Varenka, he saw that there\\nwas an eager and mysterious conversation going on between Stepan\\nArkadyevitch, Dolly, Kitty, and Veslovsky. And that was not all. He saw\\non his wife’s face an expression of real feeling as she gazed with\\nfixed eyes on the handsome face of Vassenka, who was telling them\\nsomething with great animation.\\n\\n“It’s exceedingly nice at their place,” Veslovsky was telling them\\nabout Vronsky and Anna. “I can’t, of course, take it upon myself to\\njudge, but in their house you feel the real feeling of home.”\\n\\n“What do they intend doing?”\\n\\n“I believe they think of going to Moscow.”\\n\\n“How jolly it would be for us all to go over to them together! When are\\nyou going there?” Stepan Arkadyevitch asked Vassenka.\\n\\n“I’m spending July there.”\\n\\n“Will you go?” Stepan Arkadyevitch said to his wife.\\n\\n“I’ve been wanting to a long while; I shall certainly go,” said Dolly.\\n“I am sorry for her, and I know her. She’s a splendid woman. I will go\\nalone, when you go back, and then I shall be in no one’s way. And it\\nwill be better indeed without you.”\\n\\n“To be sure,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch. “And you, Kitty?”\\n\\n“I? Why should I go?” Kitty said, flushing all over, and she glanced\\nround at her husband.\\n\\n“Do you know Anna Arkadyevna, then?” Veslovsky asked her. “She’s a very\\nfascinating woman.”\\n\\n“Yes,” she answered Veslovsky, crimsoning still more. She got up and\\nwalked across to her husband.\\n\\n“Are you going shooting, then, tomorrow?” she said.\\n\\nHis jealousy had in these few moments, especially at the flush that had\\noverspread her cheeks while she was talking to Veslovsky, gone far\\nindeed. Now as he heard her words, he construed them in his own\\nfashion. Strange as it was to him afterwards to recall it, it seemed to\\nhim at the moment clear that in asking whether he was going shooting,\\nall she cared to know was whether he would give that pleasure to\\nVassenka Veslovsky, with whom, as he fancied, she was in love.\\n\\n“Yes, I’m going,” he answered her in an unnatural voice, disagreeable\\nto himself.\\n\\n“No, better spend the day here tomorrow, or Dolly won’t see anything of\\nher husband, and set off the day after,” said Kitty.\\n\\nThe motive of Kitty’s words was interpreted by Levin thus: “Don’t\\nseparate me from _him_. I don’t care about _your_ going, but do let me\\nenjoy the society of this delightful young man.”\\n\\n“Oh, if you wish, we’ll stay here tomorrow,” Levin answered, with\\npeculiar amiability.\\n\\nVassenka meanwhile, utterly unsuspecting the misery his presence had\\noccasioned, got up from the table after Kitty, and watching her with\\nsmiling and admiring eyes, he followed her.\\n\\nLevin saw that look. He turned white, and for a minute he could hardly\\nbreathe. “How dare he look at my wife like that!” was the feeling that\\nboiled within him.\\n\\n“Tomorrow, then? Do, please, let us go,” said Vassenka, sitting down on\\na chair, and again crossing his leg as his habit was.\\n\\nLevin’s jealousy went further still. Already he saw himself a deceived\\nhusband, looked upon by his wife and her lover as simply necessary to\\nprovide them with the conveniences and pleasures of life.... But in\\nspite of that he made polite and hospitable inquiries of Vassenka about\\nhis shooting, his gun, and his boots, and agreed to go shooting next\\nday.\\n\\nHappily for Levin, the old princess cut short his agonies by getting up\\nherself and advising Kitty to go to bed. But even at this point Levin\\ncould not escape another agony. As he said good-night to his hostess,\\nVassenka would again have kissed her hand, but Kitty, reddening, drew\\nback her hand and said with a naïve bluntness, for which the old\\nprincess scolded her afterwards:\\n\\n“We don’t like that fashion.”\\n\\nIn Levin’s eyes she was to blame for having allowed such relations to\\narise, and still more to blame for showing so awkwardly that she did\\nnot like them.\\n\\n“Why, how can one want to go to bed!” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, who,\\nafter drinking several glasses of wine at supper, was now in his most\\ncharming and sentimental humor. “Look, Kitty,” he said, pointing to the\\nmoon, which had just risen behind the lime trees—“how exquisite!\\nVeslovsky, this is the time for a serenade. You know, he has a splendid\\nvoice; we practiced songs together along the road. He has brought some\\nlovely songs with him, two new ones. Varvara Andreevna and he must sing\\nsome duets.”\\n\\nWhen the party had broken up, Stepan Arkadyevitch walked a long while\\nabout the avenue with Veslovsky; their voices could be heard singing\\none of the new songs.\\n\\nLevin hearing these voices sat scowling in an easy-chair in his wife’s\\nbedroom, and maintained an obstinate silence when she asked him what\\nwas wrong. But when at last with a timid glance she hazarded the\\nquestion: “Was there perhaps something you disliked about\\nVeslovsky?”—it all burst out, and he told her all. He was humiliated\\nhimself at what he was saying, and that exasperated him all the more.\\n\\nHe stood facing her with his eyes glittering menacingly under his\\nscowling brows, and he squeezed his strong arms across his chest, as\\nthough he were straining every nerve to hold himself in. The expression\\nof his face would have been grim, and even cruel, if it had not at the\\nsame time had a look of suffering which touched her. His jaws were\\ntwitching, and his voice kept breaking.\\n\\n“You must understand that I’m not jealous, that’s a nasty word. I can’t\\nbe jealous, and believe that.... I can’t say what I feel, but this is\\nawful.... I’m not jealous, but I’m wounded, humiliated that anybody\\ndare think, that anybody dare look at you with eyes like that.”\\n\\n“Eyes like what?” said Kitty, trying as conscientiously as possible to\\nrecall every word and gesture of that evening and every shade implied\\nin them.\\n\\nAt the very bottom of her heart she did think there had been something\\nprecisely at the moment when he had crossed over after her to the other\\nend of the table; but she dared not own it even to herself, and would\\nhave been even more unable to bring herself to say so to him, and so\\nincrease his suffering.\\n\\n“And what can there possibly be attractive about me as I am now?...”\\n\\n“Ah!” he cried, clutching at his head, “you shouldn’t say that!... If\\nyou had been attractive then....”\\n\\n“Oh, no, Kostya, oh, wait a minute, oh, do listen!” she said, looking\\nat him with an expression of pained commiseration. “Why, what can you\\nbe thinking about! When for me there’s no one in the world, no one, no\\none!... Would you like me never to see anyone?”\\n\\nFor the first minute she had been offended at his jealousy; she was\\nangry that the slightest amusement, even the most innocent, should be\\nforbidden her; but now she would readily have sacrificed, not merely\\nsuch trifles, but everything, for his peace of mind, to save him from\\nthe agony he was suffering.\\n\\n“You must understand the horror and comedy of my position,” he went on\\nin a desperate whisper; “that he’s in my house, that he’s done nothing\\nimproper positively except his free and easy airs and the way he sits\\non his legs. He thinks it’s the best possible form, and so I’m obliged\\nto be civil to him.”\\n\\n“But, Kostya, you’re exaggerating,” said Kitty, at the bottom of her\\nheart rejoicing at the depth of his love for her, shown now in his\\njealousy.\\n\\n“The most awful part of it all is that you’re just as you always are,\\nand especially now when to me you’re something sacred, and we’re so\\nhappy, so particularly happy—and all of a sudden a little wretch....\\nHe’s not a little wretch; why should I abuse him? I have nothing to do\\nwith him. But why should my, and your, happiness....”\\n\\n“Do you know, I understand now what it’s all come from,” Kitty was\\nbeginning.\\n\\n“Well, what? what?”\\n\\n“I saw how you looked while we were talking at supper.”\\n\\n“Well, well!” Levin said in dismay.\\n\\nShe told him what they had been talking about. And as she told him, she\\nwas breathless with emotion. Levin was silent for a space, then he\\nscanned her pale and distressed face, and suddenly he clutched at his\\nhead.\\n\\n“Katya, I’ve been worrying you! Darling, forgive me! It’s madness!\\nKatya, I’m a criminal. And how could you be so distressed at such\\nidiocy?”\\n\\n“Oh, I was sorry for you.”\\n\\n“For me? for me? How mad I am!... But why make you miserable? It’s\\nawful to think that any outsider can shatter our happiness.”\\n\\n“It’s humiliating too, of course.”\\n\\n“Oh, then I’ll keep him here all the summer, and will overwhelm him\\nwith civility,” said Levin, kissing her hands. “You shall see.\\nTomorrow.... Oh, yes, we are going tomorrow 8\\n\\nNext day, before the ladies were up, the wagonette and a trap for the\\nshooting party were at the door, and Laska, aware since early morning\\nthat they were going shooting, after much whining and darting to and\\nfro, had sat herself down in the wagonette beside the coachman, and,\\ndisapproving of the delay, was excitedly watching the door from which\\nthe sportsmen still did not come out. The first to come out was\\nVassenka Veslovsky, in new high boots that reached half-way up his\\nthick thighs, in a green blouse, with a new Russian leather\\ncartridge-belt, and in his Scotch cap with ribbons, with a brand-new\\nEnglish gun without a sling. Laska flew up to him, welcomed him, and\\njumping up, asked him in her own way whether the others were coming\\nsoon, but getting no answer from him, she returned to her post of\\nobservation and sank into repose again, her head on one side, and one\\near pricked up to listen. At last the door opened with a creak, and\\nStepan Arkadyevitch’s spot-and-tan pointer Krak flew out, running round\\nand round and turning over in the air. Stepan Arkadyevitch himself\\nfollowed with a gun in his hand and a cigar in his mouth.\\n\\n“Good dog, good dog, Krak!” he cried encouragingly to the dog, who put\\nhis paws up on his chest, catching at his game bag. Stepan Arkadyevitch\\nwas dressed in rough leggings and spats, in torn trousers and a short\\ncoat. On his head there was a wreck of a hat of indefinite form, but\\nhis gun of a new patent was a perfect gem, and his game bag and\\ncartridge belt, though worn, were of the very best quality.\\n\\nVassenka Veslovsky had had no notion before that it was truly _chic_\\nfor a sportsman to be in tatters, but to have his shooting outfit of\\nthe best quality. He saw it now as he looked at Stepan Arkadyevitch,\\nradiant in his rags, graceful, well-fed, and joyous, a typical Russian\\nnobleman. And he made up his mind that next time he went shooting he\\nwould certainly adopt the same get-up.\\n\\n“Well, and what about our host?” he asked.\\n\\n“A young wife,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, smiling.\\n\\n“Yes, and such a charming one!”\\n\\n“He came down dressed. No doubt he’s run up to her again.”\\n\\nStepan Arkadyevitch guessed right. Levin had run up again to his wife\\nto ask her once more if she forgave him for his idiocy yesterday, and,\\nmoreover, to beg her for Christ’s sake to be more careful. The great\\nthing was for her to keep away from the children—they might any minute\\npush against her. Then he had once more to hear her declare that she\\nwas not angry with him for going away for two days, and to beg her to\\nbe sure to send him a note next morning by a servant on horseback, to\\nwrite him, if it were but two words only, to let him know that all was\\nwell with her.\\n\\nKitty was distressed, as she always was, at parting for a couple of\\ndays from her husband, but when she saw his eager figure, looking big\\nand strong in his shooting-boots and his white blouse, and a sort of\\nsportsman elation and excitement incomprehensible to her, she forgot\\nher own chagrin for the sake of his pleasure, and said good-bye to him\\ncheerfully.\\n\\n“Pardon, gentlemen!” he said, running out onto the steps. “Have you put\\nthe lunch in? Why is the chestnut on the right? Well, it doesn’t\\nmatter. Laska, down; go and lie down!”\\n\\n“Put it with the herd of oxen,” he said to the herdsman, who was\\nwaiting for him at the steps with some question. “Excuse me, here comes\\nanother villain.”\\n\\nLevin jumped out of the wagonette, in which he had already taken his\\nseat, to meet the carpenter, who came towards the steps with a rule in\\nhis hand.\\n\\n“You didn’t come to the counting house yesterday, and now you’re\\ndetaining me. Well, what is it?”\\n\\n“Would your honor let me make another turning? It’s only three steps to\\nadd. And we make it just fit at the same time. It will be much more\\nconvenient.”\\n\\n“You should have listened to me,” Levin answered with annoyance. “I\\nsaid: Put the lines and then fit in the steps. Now there’s no setting\\nit right. Do as I told you, and make a new staircase.”\\n\\nThe point was that in the lodge that was being built the carpenter had\\nspoiled the staircase, fitting it together without calculating the\\nspace it was to fill, so that the steps were all sloping when it was\\nput in place. Now the carpenter wanted, keeping the same staircase, to\\nadd three steps.\\n\\n“It will be much better.”\\n\\n“But where’s your staircase coming out with its three steps?”\\n\\n“Why, upon my word, sir,” the carpenter said with a contemptuous smile.\\n“It comes out right at the very spot. It starts, so to speak,” he said,\\nwith a persuasive gesture; “it comes down, and comes down, and comes\\nout.”\\n\\n“But three steps will add to the length too ... where is it to come\\nout?”\\n\\n“Why, to be sure, it’ll start from the bottom and go up and go up, and\\ncome out so,” the carpenter said obstinately and convincingly.\\n\\n“It’ll reach the ceiling and the wall.”\\n\\n“Upon my word! Why, it’ll go up, and up, and come out like this.”\\n\\nLevin took out a ramrod and began sketching him the staircase in the\\ndust.\\n\\n“There, do you see?”\\n\\n“As your honor likes,” said the carpenter, with a sudden gleam in his\\neyes, obviously understanding the thing at last. “It seems it’ll be\\nbest to make a new one.”\\n\\n“Well, then, do it as you’re told,” Levin shouted, seating himself in\\nthe wagonette. “Down! Hold the dogs, Philip!”\\n\\nLevin felt now at leaving behind all his family and household cares\\nsuch an eager sense of joy in life and expectation that he was not\\ndisposed to talk. Besides that, he had that feeling of concentrated\\nexcitement that every sportsman experiences as he approaches the scene\\nof action. If he had anything on his mind at that moment, it was only\\nthe doubt whether they would start anything in the Kolpensky marsh,\\nwhether Laska would show to advantage in comparison with Krak, and\\nwhether he would shoot well that day himself. Not to disgrace himself\\nbefore a new spectator—not to be outdone by Oblonsky—that too was a\\nthought that crossed his brain.\\n\\nOblonsky was feeling the same, and he too was not talkative. Vassenka\\nVeslovsky kept up alone a ceaseless flow of cheerful chatter. As he\\nlistened to him now, Levin felt ashamed to think how unfair he had been\\nto him the day before. Vassenka was really a nice fellow, simple,\\ngood-hearted, and very good-humored. If Levin had met him before he was\\nmarried, he would have made friends with him. Levin rather disliked his\\nholiday attitude to life and a sort of free and easy assumption of\\nelegance. It was as though he assumed a high degree of importance in\\nhimself that could not be disputed, because he had long nails and a\\nstylish cap, and everything else to correspond; but this could be\\nforgiven for the sake of his good nature and good breeding. Levin liked\\nhim for his good education, for speaking French and English with such\\nan excellent accent, and for being a man of his world.\\n\\nVassenka was extremely delighted with the left horse, a horse of the\\nDon Steppes. He kept praising him enthusiastically. “How fine it must\\nbe galloping over the steppes on a steppe horse! Eh? isn’t it?” he\\nsaid. He had imagined riding on a steppe horse as something wild and\\nromantic, and it turned out nothing of the sort. But his simplicity,\\nparticularly in conjunction with his good looks, his amiable smile, and\\nthe grace of his movements, was very attractive. Either because his\\nnature was sympathetic to Levin, or because Levin was trying to atone\\nfor his sins of the previous evening by seeing nothing but what was\\ngood in him, anyway he liked his society.\\n\\nAfter they had driven over two miles from home, Veslovsky all at once\\nfelt for a cigar and his pocketbook, and did not know whether he had\\nlost them or left them on the table. In the pocketbook there were\\nthirty-seven pounds, and so the matter could not be left in\\nuncertainty.\\n\\n“Do you know what, Levin, I’ll gallop home on that left trace-horse.\\nThat will be splendid. Eh?” he said, preparing to get out.\\n\\n“No, why should you?” answered Levin, calculating that Vassenka could\\nhardly weigh less than seventeen stone. “I’ll send the coachman.”\\n\\nThe coachman rode back on the trace-horse, and Levin himself drove the\\nremaining pair 9\\n\\n“Well, now what’s our plan of campaign? Tell us all about it,” said\\nStepan Arkadyevitch.\\n\\n“Our plan is this. Now we’re driving to Gvozdyov. In Gvozdyov there’s a\\ngrouse marsh on this side, and beyond Gvozdyov come some magnificent\\nsnipe marshes where there are grouse too. It’s hot now, and we’ll get\\nthere—it’s fifteen miles or so—towards evening and have some evening\\nshooting; we’ll spend the night there and go on tomorrow to the bigger\\nmoors.”\\n\\n“And is there nothing on the way?”\\n\\n“Yes; but we’ll reserve ourselves; besides it’s hot. There are two nice\\nlittle places, but I doubt there being anything to shoot.”\\n\\nLevin would himself have liked to go into these little places, but they\\nwere near home; he could shoot them over any time, and they were only\\nlittle places—there would hardly be room for three to shoot. And so,\\nwith some insincerity, he said that he doubted there being anything to\\nshoot. When they reached a little marsh Levin would have driven by, but\\nStepan Arkadyevitch, with the experienced eye of a sportsman, at once\\ndetected reeds visible from the road.\\n\\n“Shan’t we try that?” he said, pointing to the little marsh.\\n\\n“Levin, do, please! how delightful!” Vassenka Veslovsky began begging,\\nand Levin could but consent.\\n\\nBefore they had time to stop, the dogs had flown one before the other\\ninto the marsh.\\n\\n“Krak! Laska!...”\\n\\nThe dogs came back.\\n\\n“There won’t be room for three. I’ll stay here,” said Levin, hoping\\nthey would find nothing but peewits, who had been startled by the dogs,\\nand turning over in their flight, were plaintively wailing over the\\nmarsh.\\n\\n“No! Come along, Levin, let’s go together!” Veslovsky called.\\n\\n“Really, there’s not room. Laska, back, Laska! You won’t want another\\ndog, will you?”\\n\\nLevin remained with the wagonette, and looked enviously at the\\nsportsmen. They walked right across the marsh. Except little birds and\\npeewits, of which Vassenka killed one, there was nothing in the marsh.\\n\\n“Come, you see now that it was not that I grudged the marsh,” said\\nLevin, “only it’s wasting time.”\\n\\n“Oh, no, it was jolly all the same. Did you see us?” said Vassenka\\nVeslovsky, clambering awkwardly into the wagonette with his gun and his\\npeewit in his hands. “How splendidly I shot this bird! Didn’t I? Well,\\nshall we soon be getting to the real place?”\\n\\nThe horses started off suddenly, Levin knocked his head against the\\nstock of someone’s gun, and there was the report of a shot. The gun did\\nactually go off first, but that was how it seemed to Levin. It appeared\\nthat Vassenka Veslovsky had pulled only one trigger, and had left the\\nother hammer still cocked. The charge flew into the ground without\\ndoing harm to anyone. Stepan Arkadyevitch shook his head and laughed\\nreprovingly at Veslovsky. But Levin had not the heart to reprove him.\\nIn the first place, any reproach would have seemed to be called forth\\nby the danger he had incurred and the bump that had come up on Levin’s\\nforehead. And besides, Veslovsky was at first so naïvely distressed,\\nand then laughed so good-humoredly and infectiously at their general\\ndismay, that one could not but laugh with him.\\n\\nWhen they reached the second marsh, which was fairly large, and would\\ninevitably take some time to shoot over, Levin tried to persuade them\\nto pass it by. But Veslovsky again overpersuaded him. Again, as the\\nmarsh was narrow, Levin, like a good host, remained with the carriage.\\n\\nKrak made straight for some clumps of sedge. Vassenka Veslovsky was the\\nfirst to run after the dog. Before Stepan Arkadyevitch had time to come\\nup, a grouse flew out. Veslovsky missed it and it flew into an unmown\\nmeadow. This grouse was left for Veslovsky to follow up. Krak found it\\nagain and pointed, and Veslovsky shot it and went back to the carriage.\\n“Now you go and I’ll stay with the horses,” he said.\\n\\nLevin had begun to feel the pangs of a sportsman’s envy. He handed the\\nreins to Veslovsky and walked into the marsh.\\n\\nLaska, who had been plaintively whining and fretting against the\\ninjustice of her treatment, flew straight ahead to a hopeful place that\\nLevin knew well, and that Krak had not yet come upon.\\n\\n“Why don’t you stop her?” shouted Stepan Arkadyevitch.\\n\\n“She won’t scare them,” answered Levin, sympathizing with his bitch’s\\npleasure and hurrying after her.\\n\\nAs she came nearer and nearer to the familiar breeding places there was\\nmore and more earnestness in Laska’s exploration. A little marsh bird\\ndid not divert her attention for more than an instant. She made one\\ncircuit round the clump of reeds, was beginning a second, and suddenly\\nquivered with excitement and became motionless.\\n\\n“Come, come, Stiva!” shouted Levin, feeling his heart beginning to beat\\nmore violently; and all of a sudden, as though some sort of shutter had\\nbeen drawn back from his straining ears, all sounds, confused but loud,\\nbegan to beat on his hearing, losing all sense of distance. He heard\\nthe steps of Stepan Arkadyevitch, mistaking them for the tramp of the\\nhorses in the distance; he heard the brittle sound of the twigs on\\nwhich he had trodden, taking this sound for the flying of a grouse. He\\nheard too, not far behind him, a splashing in the water, which he could\\nnot explain to himself.\\n\\nPicking his steps, he moved up to the dog.\\n\\n“Fetch it!”\\n\\nNot a grouse but a snipe flew up from beside the dog. Levin had lifted\\nhis gun, but at the very instant when he was taking aim, the sound of\\nsplashing grew louder, came closer, and was joined with the sound of\\nVeslovsky’s voice, shouting something with strange loudness. Levin saw\\nhe had his gun pointed behind the snipe, but still he fired.\\n\\nWhen he had made sure he had missed, Levin looked round and saw the\\nhorses and the wagonette not on the road but in the marsh.\\n\\nVeslovsky, eager to see the shooting, had driven into the marsh, and\\ngot the horses stuck in the mud.\\n\\n“Damn the fellow!” Levin said to himself, as he went back to the\\ncarriage that had sunk in the mire. “What did you drive in for?” he\\nsaid to him dryly, and calling the coachman, he began pulling the\\nhorses out.\\n\\nLevin was vexed both at being hindered from shooting and at his horses\\ngetting stuck in the mud, and still more at the fact that neither\\nStepan Arkadyevitch nor Veslovsky helped him and the coachman to\\nunharness the horses and get them out, since neither of them had the\\nslightest notion of harnessing. Without vouchsafing a syllable in reply\\nto Vassenka’s protestations that it had been quite dry there, Levin\\nworked in silence with the coachman at extricating the horses. But\\nthen, as he got warm at the work and saw how assiduously Veslovsky was\\ntugging at the wagonette by one of the mud-guards, so that he broke it\\nindeed, Levin blamed himself for having under the influence of\\nyesterday’s feelings been too cold to Veslovsky, and tried to be\\nparticularly genial so as to smooth over his chilliness. When\\neverything had been put right, and the carriage had been brought back\\nto the road, Levin had the lunch served.\\n\\n“_Bon appétit—bonne conscience! Ce poulet va tomber jusqu’au fond de\\nmes bottes_,” Vassenka, who had recovered his spirits, quoted the\\nFrench saying as he finished his second chicken. “Well, now our\\ntroubles are over, now everything’s going to go well. Only, to atone\\nfor my sins, I’m bound to sit on the box. That’s so? eh? No, no! I’ll\\nbe your Automedon. You shall see how I’ll get you along,” he answered,\\nnot letting go the rein, when Levin begged him to let the coachman\\ndrive. “No, I must atone for my sins, and I’m very comfortable on the\\nbox.” And he drove.\\n\\nLevin was a little afraid he would exhaust the horses, especially the\\nchestnut, whom he did not know how to hold in; but unconsciously he\\nfell under the influence of his gaiety and listened to the songs he\\nsang all the way on the box, or the descriptions and representations he\\ngave of driving in the English fashion, four-in-hand; and it was in the\\nvery best of spirits that after lunch they drove to the Gvozdyov marsh 10\\n\\nVassenka drove the horses so smartly that they reached the marsh too\\nearly, while it was still hot.\\n\\nAs they drew near this more important marsh, the chief aim of their\\nexpedition, Levin could not help considering how he could get rid of\\nVassenka and be free in his movements. Stepan Arkadyevitch evidently\\nhad the same desire, and on his face Levin saw the look of anxiety\\nalways present in a true sportsman when beginning shooting, together\\nwith a certain good-humored slyness peculiar to him.\\n\\n“How shall we go? It’s a splendid marsh, I see, and there are hawks,”\\nsaid Stepan Arkadyevitch, pointing to two great birds hovering over the\\nreeds. “Where there are hawks, there is sure to be game.”\\n\\n“Now, gentlemen,” said Levin, pulling up his boots and examining the\\nlock of his gun with rather a gloomy expression, “do you see those\\nreeds?” He pointed to an oasis of blackish green in the huge half-mown\\nwet meadow that stretched along the right bank of the river. “The marsh\\nbegins here, straight in front of us, do you see—where it is greener?\\nFrom here it runs to the right where the horses are; there are breeding\\nplaces there, and grouse, and all round those reeds as far as that\\nalder, and right up to the mill. Over there, do you see, where the\\npools are? That’s the best place. There I once shot seventeen snipe.\\nWe’ll separate with the dogs and go in different directions, and then\\nmeet over there at the mill.”\\n\\n“Well, which shall go to left and which to right?” asked Stepan\\nArkadyevitch. “It’s wider to the right; you two go that way and I’ll\\ntake the left,” he said with apparent carelessness.\\n\\n“Capital! we’ll make the bigger bag! Yes, come along, come along!”\\nVassenka exclaimed.\\n\\nLevin could do nothing but agree, and they divided.\\n\\nAs soon as they entered the marsh, the two dogs began hunting about\\ntogether and made towards the green, slime-covered pool. Levin knew\\nLaska’s method, wary and indefinite; he knew the place too and expected\\na whole covey of snipe.\\n\\n“Veslovsky, beside me, walk beside me!” he said in a faint voice to his\\ncompanion splashing in the water behind him. Levin could not help\\nfeeling an interest in the direction his gun was pointed, after that\\ncasual shot near the Kolpensky marsh.\\n\\n“Oh, I won’t get in your way, don’t trouble about me.”\\n\\nBut Levin could not help troubling, and recalled Kitty’s words at\\nparting: “Mind you don’t shoot one another.” The dogs came nearer and\\nnearer, passed each other, each pursuing its own scent. The expectation\\nof snipe was so intense that to Levin the squelching sound of his own\\nheel, as he drew it up out of the mire, seemed to be the call of a\\nsnipe, and he clutched and pressed the lock of his gun.\\n\\n“Bang! bang!” sounded almost in his ear. Vassenka had fired at a flock\\nof ducks which was hovering over the marsh and flying at that moment\\ntowards the sportsmen, far out of range. Before Levin had time to look\\nround, there was the whir of one snipe, another, a third, and some\\neight more rose one after another.\\n\\nStepan Arkadyevitch hit one at the very moment when it was beginning\\nits zigzag movements, and the snipe fell in a heap into the mud.\\nOblonsky aimed deliberately at another, still flying low in the reeds,\\nand together with the report of the shot, that snipe too fell, and it\\ncould be seen fluttering out where the sedge had been cut, its unhurt\\nwing showing white beneath.\\n\\nLevin was not so lucky: he aimed at his first bird too low, and missed;\\nhe aimed at it again, just as it was rising, but at that instant\\nanother snipe flew up at his very feet, distracting him so that he\\nmissed again.\\n\\nWhile they were loading their guns, another snipe rose, and Veslovsky,\\nwho had had time to load again, sent two charges of small-shot into the\\nwater. Stepan Arkadyevitch picked up his snipe, and with sparkling eyes\\nlooked at Levin.\\n\\n“Well, now let us separate,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, and limping on\\nhis left foot, holding his gun in readiness and whistling to his dog,\\nhe walked off in one direction. Levin and Veslovsky walked in the\\nother.\\n\\nIt always happened with Levin that when his first shots were a failure\\nhe got hot and out of temper, and shot badly the whole day. So it was\\nthat day. The snipe showed themselves in numbers. They kept flying up\\nfrom just under the dogs, from under the sportsmen’s legs, and Levin\\nmight have retrieved his ill luck. But the more he shot, the more he\\nfelt disgraced in the eyes of Veslovsky, who kept popping away merrily\\nand indiscriminately, killing nothing, and not in the slightest abashed\\nby his ill success. Levin, in feverish haste, could not restrain\\nhimself, got more and more out of temper, and ended by shooting almost\\nwithout a hope of hitting. Laska, indeed, seemed to understand this.\\nShe began looking more languidly, and gazed back at the sportsmen, as\\nit were, with perplexity or reproach in her eyes. Shots followed shots\\nin rapid succession. The smoke of the powder hung about the sportsmen,\\nwhile in the great roomy net of the game bag there were only three\\nlight little snipe. And of these one had been killed by Veslovsky\\nalone, and one by both of them together. Meanwhile from the other side\\nof the marsh came the sound of Stepan Arkadyevitch’s shots, not\\nfrequent, but, as Levin fancied, well-directed, for almost after each\\nthey heard “Krak, Krak, _apporte_!”\\n\\nThis excited Levin still more. The snipe were floating continually in\\nthe air over the reeds. Their whirring wings close to the earth, and\\ntheir harsh cries high in the air, could be heard on all sides; the\\nsnipe that had risen first and flown up into the air, settled again\\nbefore the sportsmen. Instead of two hawks there were now dozens of\\nthem hovering with shrill cries over the marsh.\\n\\nAfter walking through the larger half of the marsh, Levin and Veslovsky\\nreached the place where the peasants’ mowing-grass was divided into\\nlong strips reaching to the reeds, marked off in one place by the\\ntrampled grass, in another by a path mown through it. Half of these\\nstrips had already been mown.\\n\\nThough there was not so much hope of finding birds in the uncut part as\\nthe cut part, Levin had promised Stepan Arkadyevitch to meet him, and\\nso he walked on with his companion through the cut and uncut patches.\\n\\n“Hi, sportsmen!” shouted one of a group of peasants, sitting on an\\nunharnessed cart; “come and have some lunch with us! Have a drop of\\nwine!”\\n\\nLevin looked round.\\n\\n“Come along, it’s all right!” shouted a good-humored-looking bearded\\npeasant with a red face, showing his white teeth in a grin, and holding\\nup a greenish bottle that flashed in the sunlight.\\n\\n“_Qu’est-ce qu’ils disent_?” asked Veslovsky.\\n\\n“They invite you to have some vodka. Most likely they’ve been dividing\\nthe meadow into lots. I should have some,” said Levin, not without some\\nguile, hoping Veslovsky would be tempted by the vodka, and would go\\naway to them.\\n\\n“Why do they offer it?”\\n\\n“Oh, they’re merry-making. Really, you should join them. You would be\\ninterested.”\\n\\n“_Allons, c’est curieux_.”\\n\\n“You go, you go, you’ll find the way to the mill!” cried Levin, and\\nlooking round he perceived with satisfaction that Veslovsky, bent and\\nstumbling with weariness, holding his gun out at arm’s length, was\\nmaking his way out of the marsh towards the peasants.\\n\\n“You come too!” the peasants shouted to Levin. “Never fear! You taste\\nour cake!”\\n\\nLevin felt a strong inclination to drink a little vodka and to eat some\\nbread. He was exhausted, and felt it a great effort to drag his\\nstaggering legs out of the mire, and for a minute he hesitated. But\\nLaska was setting. And immediately all his weariness vanished, and he\\nwalked lightly through the swamp towards the dog. A snipe flew up at\\nhis feet; he fired and killed it. Laska still pointed.—“Fetch it!”\\nAnother bird flew up close to the dog. Levin fired. But it was an\\nunlucky day for him; he missed it, and when he went to look for the one\\nhe had shot, he could not find that either. He wandered all about the\\nreeds, but Laska did not believe he had shot it, and when he sent her\\nto find it, she pretended to hunt for it, but did not really. And in\\nthe absence of Vassenka, on whom Levin threw the blame of his failure,\\nthings went no better. There were plenty of snipe still, but Levin made\\none miss after another.\\n\\nThe slanting rays of the sun were still hot; his clothes, soaked\\nthrough with perspiration, stuck to his body; his left boot full of\\nwater weighed heavily on his leg and squeaked at every step; the sweat\\nran in drops down his powder-grimed face, his mouth was full of the\\nbitter taste, his nose of the smell of powder and stagnant water, his\\nears were ringing with the incessant whir of the snipe; he could not\\ntouch the stock of his gun, it was so hot; his heart beat with short,\\nrapid throbs; his hands shook with excitement, and his weary legs\\nstumbled and staggered over the hillocks and in the swamp, but still he\\nwalked on and still he shot. At last, after a disgraceful miss, he\\nflung his gun and his hat on the ground.\\n\\n“No, I must control myself,” he said to himself. Picking up his gun and\\nhis hat, he called Laska, and went out of the swamp. When he got on to\\ndry ground he sat down, pulled off his boot and emptied it, then walked\\nto the marsh, drank some stagnant-tasting water, moistened his burning\\nhot gun, and washed his face and hands. Feeling refreshed, he went back\\nto the spot where a snipe had settled, firmly resolved to keep cool.\\n\\nHe tried to be calm, but it was the same again. His finger pressed the\\ncock before he had taken a good aim at the bird. It got worse and\\nworse.\\n\\nHe had only five birds in his game-bag when he walked out of the marsh\\ntowards the alders where he was to rejoin Stepan Arkadyevitch.\\n\\nBefore he caught sight of Stepan Arkadyevitch he saw his dog. Krak\\ndarted out from behind the twisted root of an alder, black all over\\nwith the stinking mire of the marsh, and with the air of a conqueror\\nsniffed at Laska. Behind Krak there came into view in the shade of the\\nalder tree the shapely figure of Stepan Arkadyevitch. He came to meet\\nhim, red and perspiring, with unbuttoned neckband, still limping in the\\nsame way.\\n\\n“Well? You have been popping away!” he said, smiling good-humoredly.\\n\\n“How have you got on?” queried Levin. But there was no need to ask, for\\nhe had already seen the full game bag.\\n\\n“Oh, pretty fair.”\\n\\nHe had fourteen birds.\\n\\n“A splendid marsh! I’ve no doubt Veslovsky got in your way. It’s\\nawkward too, shooting with one dog,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, to\\nsoften his triumph 11\\n\\nWhen Levin and Stepan Arkadyevitch reached the peasant’s hut where\\nLevin always used to stay, Veslovsky was already there. He was sitting\\nin the middle of the hut, clinging with both hands to the bench from\\nwhich he was being pulled by a soldier, the brother of the peasant’s\\nwife, who was helping him off with his miry boots. Veslovsky was\\nlaughing his infectious, good-humored laugh.\\n\\n“I’ve only just come. _Ils ont été charmants_. Just fancy, they gave me\\ndrink, fed me! Such bread, it was exquisite! _Délicieux!_ And the\\nvodka, I never tasted any better. And they would not take a penny for\\nanything. And they kept saying: ‘Excuse our homely ways.’”\\n\\n“What should they take anything for? They were entertaining you, to be\\nsure. Do you suppose they keep vodka for sale?” said the soldier,\\nsucceeding at last in pulling the soaked boot off the blackened\\nstocking.\\n\\nIn spite of the dirtiness of the hut, which was all muddied by their\\nboots and the filthy dogs licking themselves clean, and the smell of\\nmarsh mud and powder that filled the room, and the absence of knives\\nand forks, the party drank their tea and ate their supper with a relish\\nonly known to sportsmen. Washed and clean, they went into a hay-barn\\nswept ready for them, where the coachman had been making up beds for\\nthe gentlemen.\\n\\nThough it was dusk, not one of them wanted to go to sleep.\\n\\nAfter wavering among reminiscences and anecdotes of guns, of dogs, and\\nof former shooting parties, the conversation rested on a topic that\\ninterested all of them. After Vassenka had several times over expressed\\nhis appreciation of this delightful sleeping place among the fragrant\\nhay, this delightful broken cart (he supposed it to be broken because\\nthe shafts had been taken out), of the good nature of the peasants that\\nhad treated him to vodka, of the dogs who lay at the feet of their\\nrespective masters, Oblonsky began telling them of a delightful\\nshooting party at Malthus’s, where he had stayed the previous summer.\\n\\nMalthus was a well-known capitalist, who had made his money by\\nspeculation in railway shares. Stepan Arkadyevitch described what\\ngrouse moors this Malthus had bought in the Tver province, and how they\\nwere preserved, and of the carriages and dogcarts in which the shooting\\nparty had been driven, and the luncheon pavilion that had been rigged\\nup at the marsh.\\n\\n“I don’t understand you,” said Levin, sitting up in the hay; “how is it\\nsuch people don’t disgust you? I can understand a lunch with Lafitte is\\nall very pleasant, but don’t you dislike just that very sumptuousness?\\nAll these people, just like our spirit monopolists in old days, get\\ntheir money in a way that gains them the contempt of everyone. They\\ndon’t care for their contempt, and then they use their dishonest gains\\nto buy off the contempt they have deserved.”\\n\\n“Perfectly true!” chimed in Vassenka Veslovsky. “Perfectly! Oblonsky,\\nof course, goes out of _bonhomie_, but other people say: ‘Well,\\nOblonsky stays with them.’...”\\n\\n“Not a bit of it.” Levin could hear that Oblonsky was smiling as he\\nspoke. “I simply don’t consider him more dishonest than any other\\nwealthy merchant or nobleman. They’ve all made their money alike—by\\ntheir work and their intelligence.”\\n\\n“Oh, by what work? Do you call it work to get hold of concessions and\\nspeculate with them?”\\n\\n“Of course it’s work. Work in this sense, that if it were not for him\\nand others like him, there would have been no railways.”\\n\\n“But that’s not work, like the work of a peasant or a learned\\nprofession.”\\n\\n“Granted, but it’s work in the sense that his activity produces a\\nresult—the railways. But of course you think the railways useless.”\\n\\n“No, that’s another question; I am prepared to admit that they’re\\nuseful. But all profit that is out of proportion to the labor expended\\nis dishonest.”\\n\\n“But who is to define what is proportionate?”\\n\\n“Making profit by dishonest means, by trickery,” said Levin, conscious\\nthat he could not draw a distinct line between honesty and dishonesty.\\n“Such as banking, for instance,” he went on. “It’s an evil—the amassing\\nof huge fortunes without labor, just the same thing as with the spirit\\nmonopolies, it’s only the form that’s changed. _Le roi est mort, vive\\nle roi_. No sooner were the spirit monopolies abolished than the\\nrailways came up, and banking companies; that, too, is profit without\\nwork.”\\n\\n“Yes, that may all be very true and clever.... Lie down, Krak!” Stepan\\nArkadyevitch called to his dog, who was scratching and turning over all\\nthe hay. He was obviously convinced of the correctness of his position,\\nand so talked serenely and without haste. “But you have not drawn the\\nline between honest and dishonest work. That I receive a bigger salary\\nthan my chief clerk, though he knows more about the work than I\\ndo—that’s dishonest, I suppose?”\\n\\n“I can’t say.”\\n\\n“Well, but I can tell you: your receiving some five thousand, let’s\\nsay, for your work on the land, while our host, the peasant here,\\nhowever hard he works, can never get more than fifty roubles, is just\\nas dishonest as my earning more than my chief clerk, and Malthus\\ngetting more than a station-master. No, quite the contrary; I see that\\nsociety takes up a sort of antagonistic attitude to these people, which\\nis utterly baseless, and I fancy there’s envy at the bottom of it....”\\n\\n“No, that’s unfair,” said Veslovsky; “how could envy come in? There is\\nsomething not nice about that sort of business.”\\n\\n“You say,” Levin went on, “that it’s unjust for me to receive five\\nthousand, while the peasant has fifty; that’s true. It is unfair, and I\\nfeel it, but....”\\n\\n“It really is. Why is it we spend our time riding, drinking, shooting,\\ndoing nothing, while they are forever at work?” said Vassenka\\nVeslovsky, obviously for the first time in his life reflecting on the\\nquestion, and consequently considering it with perfect sincerity.\\n\\n“Yes, you feel it, but you don’t give him your property,” said Stepan\\nArkadyevitch, intentionally, as it seemed, provoking Levin.\\n\\nThere had arisen of late something like a secret antagonism between the\\ntwo brothers-in-law; as though, since they had married sisters, a kind\\nof rivalry had sprung up between them as to which was ordering his life\\nbest, and now this hostility showed itself in the conversation, as it\\nbegan to take a personal note.\\n\\n“I don’t give it away, because no one demands that from me, and if I\\nwanted to, I could not give it away,” answered Levin, “and have no one\\nto give it to.”\\n\\n“Give it to this peasant, he would not refuse it.”\\n\\n“Yes, but how am I to give it up? Am I to go to him and make a deed of\\nconveyance?”\\n\\n“I don’t know; but if you are convinced that you have no right....”\\n\\n“I’m not at all convinced. On the contrary, I feel I have no right to\\ngive it up, that I have duties both to the land and to my family.”\\n\\n“No, excuse me, but if you consider this inequality is unjust, why is\\nit you don’t act accordingly?...”\\n\\n“Well, I do act negatively on that idea, so far as not trying to\\nincrease the difference of position existing between him and me.”\\n\\n“No, excuse me, that’s a paradox.”\\n\\n“Yes, there’s something of a sophistry about that,” Veslovsky agreed.\\n“Ah! our host; so you’re not asleep yet?” he said to the peasant who\\ncame into the barn, opening the creaking door. “How is it you’re not\\nasleep?”\\n\\n“No, how’s one to sleep! I thought our gentlemen would be asleep, but I\\nheard them chattering. I want to get a hook from here. She won’t bite?”\\nhe added, stepping cautiously with his bare feet.\\n\\n“And where are you going to sleep?”\\n\\n“We are going out for the night with the beasts.”\\n\\n“Ah, what a night!” said Veslovsky, looking out at the edge of the hut\\nand the unharnessed wagonette that could be seen in the faint light of\\nthe evening glow in the great frame of the open doors. “But listen,\\nthere are women’s voices singing, and, on my word, not badly too. Who’s\\nthat singing, my friend?”\\n\\n“That’s the maids from hard by here.”\\n\\n“Let’s go, let’s have a walk! We shan’t go to sleep, you know.\\nOblonsky, come along!”\\n\\n“If one could only do both, lie here and go,” answered Oblonsky,\\nstretching. “It’s capital lying here.”\\n\\n“Well, I shall go by myself,” said Veslovsky, getting up eagerly, and\\nputting on his shoes and stockings. “Good-bye, gentlemen. If it’s fun,\\nI’ll fetch you. You’ve treated me to some good sport, and I won’t\\nforget you.”\\n\\n“He really is a capital fellow, isn’t he?” said Stepan Arkadyevitch,\\nwhen Veslovsky had gone out and the peasant had closed the door after\\nhim.\\n\\n“Yes, capital,” answered Levin, still thinking of the subject of their\\nconversation just before. It seemed to him that he had clearly\\nexpressed his thoughts and feelings to the best of his capacity, and\\nyet both of them, straightforward men and not fools, had said with one\\nvoice that he was comforting himself with sophistries. This\\ndisconcerted him.\\n\\n“It’s just this, my dear boy. One must do one of two things: either\\nadmit that the existing order of society is just, and then stick up for\\none’s rights in it; or acknowledge that you are enjoying unjust\\nprivileges, as I do, and then enjoy them and be satisfied.”\\n\\n“No, if it were unjust, you could not enjoy these advantages and be\\nsatisfied—at least I could not. The great thing for me is to feel that\\nI’m not to blame.”\\n\\n“What do you say, why not go after all?” said Stepan Arkadyevitch,\\nevidently weary of the strain of thought. “We shan’t go to sleep, you\\nknow. Come, let’s go!”\\n\\nLevin did not answer. What they had said in the conversation, that he\\nacted justly only in a negative sense, absorbed his thoughts. “Can it\\nbe that it’s only possible to be just negatively?” he was asking\\nhimself.\\n\\n“How strong the smell of the fresh hay is, though,” said Stepan\\nArkadyevitch, getting up. “There’s not a chance of sleeping. Vassenka\\nhas been getting up some fun there. Do you hear the laughing and his\\nvoice? Hadn’t we better go? Come along!”\\n\\n“No, I’m not coming,” answered Levin.\\n\\n“Surely that’s not a matter of principle too,” said Stepan\\nArkadyevitch, smiling, as he felt about in the dark for his cap.\\n\\n“It’s not a matter of principle, but why should I go?”\\n\\n“But do you know you are preparing trouble for yourself,” said Stepan\\nArkadyevitch, finding his cap and getting up.\\n\\n“How so?”\\n\\n“Do you suppose I don’t see the line you’ve taken up with your wife? I\\nheard how it’s a question of the greatest consequence, whether or not\\nyou’re to be away for a couple of days’ shooting. That’s all very well\\nas an idyllic episode, but for your whole life that won’t answer. A man\\nmust be independent; he has his masculine interests. A man has to be\\nmanly,” said Oblonsky, opening the door.\\n\\n“In what way? To go running after servant girls?” said Levin.\\n\\n“Why not, if it amuses him? _Ça ne tire pas à conséquence_. It won’t do\\nmy wife any harm, and it’ll amuse me. The great thing is to respect the\\nsanctity of the home. There should be nothing in the home. But don’t\\ntie your own hands.”\\n\\n“Perhaps so,” said Levin dryly, and he turned on his side. “Tomorrow,\\nearly, I want to go shooting, and I won’t wake anyone, and shall set\\noff at daybreak.”\\n\\n“_Messieurs, venez vite!_” they heard the voice of Veslovsky coming\\nback. “_Charmante!_ I’ve made such a discovery. _Charmante!_ a perfect\\nGretchen, and I’ve already made friends with her. Really, exceedingly\\npretty,” he declared in a tone of approval, as though she had been made\\npretty entirely on his account, and he was expressing his satisfaction\\nwith the entertainment that had been provided for him.\\n\\nLevin pretended to be asleep, while Oblonsky, putting on his slippers,\\nand lighting a cigar, walked out of the barn, and soon their voices\\nwere lost.\\n\\nFor a long while Levin could not get to sleep. He heard the horses\\nmunching hay, then he heard the peasant and his elder boy getting ready\\nfor the night, and going off for the night watch with the beasts, then\\nhe heard the soldier arranging his bed on the other side of the barn,\\nwith his nephew, the younger son of their peasant host. He heard the\\nboy in his shrill little voice telling his uncle what he thought about\\nthe dogs, who seemed to him huge and terrible creatures, and asking\\nwhat the dogs were going to hunt next day, and the soldier in a husky,\\nsleepy voice, telling him the sportsmen were going in the morning to\\nthe marsh, and would shoot with their guns; and then, to check the\\nboy’s questions, he said, “Go to sleep, Vaska; go to sleep, or you’ll\\ncatch it,” and soon after he began snoring himself, and everything was\\nstill. He could only hear the snort of the horses, and the guttural cry\\nof a snipe.\\n\\n“Is it really only negative?” he repeated to himself. “Well, what of\\nit? It’s not my fault.” And he began thinking about the next day.\\n\\n“Tomorrow I’ll go out early, and I’ll make a point of keeping cool.\\nThere are lots of snipe; and there are grouse too. When I come back\\nthere’ll be the note from Kitty. Yes, Stiva may be right, I’m not manly\\nwith her, I’m tied to her apron-strings.... Well, it can’t be helped!\\nNegative again....”\\n\\nHalf asleep, he heard the laughter and mirthful talk of Veslovsky and\\nStepan Arkadyevitch. For an instant he opened his eyes: the moon was\\nup, and in the open doorway, brightly lighted up by the moonlight, they\\nwere standing talking. Stepan Arkadyevitch was saying something of the\\nfreshness of one girl, comparing her to a freshly peeled nut, and\\nVeslovsky with his infectious laugh was repeating some words, probably\\nsaid to him by a peasant: “Ah, you do your best to get round her!”\\nLevin, half asleep, said:\\n\\n“Gentlemen, tomorrow before daylight!” and fell asleep 12\\n\\nWaking up at earliest dawn, Levin tried to wake his companions.\\nVassenka, lying on his stomach, with one leg in a stocking thrust out,\\nwas sleeping so soundly that he could elicit no response. Oblonsky,\\nhalf asleep, declined to get up so early. Even Laska, who was asleep,\\ncurled up in the hay, got up unwillingly, and lazily stretched out and\\nstraightened her hind legs one after the other. Getting on his boots\\nand stockings, taking his gun, and carefully opening the creaking door\\nof the barn, Levin went out into the road. The coachmen were sleeping\\nin their carriages, the horses were dozing. Only one was lazily eating\\noats, dipping its nose into the manger. It was still gray out-of-doors.\\n\\n“Why are you up so early, my dear?” the old woman, their hostess, said,\\ncoming out of the hut and addressing him affectionately as an old\\nfriend.\\n\\n“Going shooting, granny. Do I go this way to the marsh?”\\n\\n“Straight out at the back; by our threshing floor, my dear, and hemp\\npatches; there’s a little footpath.” Stepping carefully with her\\nsunburnt, bare feet, the old woman conducted Levin, and moved back the\\nfence for him by the threshing floor.\\n\\n“Straight on and you’ll come to the marsh. Our lads drove the cattle\\nthere yesterday evening.”\\n\\nLaska ran eagerly forward along the little path. Levin followed her\\nwith a light, rapid step, continually looking at the sky. He hoped the\\nsun would not be up before he reached the marsh. But the sun did not\\ndelay. The moon, which had been bright when he went out, by now shone\\nonly like a crescent of quicksilver. The pink flush of dawn, which one\\ncould not help seeing before, now had to be sought to be discerned at\\nall. What were before undefined, vague blurs in the distant countryside\\ncould now be distinctly seen. They were sheaves of rye. The dew, not\\nvisible till the sun was up, wetted Levin’s legs and his blouse above\\nhis belt in the high growing, fragrant hemp patch, from which the\\npollen had already fallen out. In the transparent stillness of morning\\nthe smallest sounds were audible. A bee flew by Levin’s ear with the\\nwhizzing sound of a bullet. He looked carefully, and saw a second and a\\nthird. They were all flying from the beehives behind the hedge, and\\nthey disappeared over the hemp patch in the direction of the marsh. The\\npath led straight to the marsh. The marsh could be recognized by the\\nmist which rose from it, thicker in one place and thinner in another,\\nso that the reeds and willow bushes swayed like islands in this mist.\\nAt the edge of the marsh and the road, peasant boys and men, who had\\nbeen herding for the night, were lying, and in the dawn all were asleep\\nunder their coats. Not far from them were three hobbled horses. One of\\nthem clanked a chain. Laska walked beside her master, pressing a little\\nforward and looking round. Passing the sleeping peasants and reaching\\nthe first reeds, Levin examined his pistols and let his dog off. One of\\nthe horses, a sleek, dark-brown three-year-old, seeing the dog, started\\naway, switched its tail and snorted. The other horses too were\\nfrightened, and splashing through the water with their hobbled legs,\\nand drawing their hoofs out of the thick mud with a squelching sound,\\nthey bounded out of the marsh. Laska stopped, looking ironically at the\\nhorses and inquiringly at Levin. Levin patted Laska, and whistled as a\\nsign that she might begin.\\n\\nLaska ran joyfully and anxiously through the slush that swayed under\\nher.\\n\\nRunning into the marsh among the familiar scents of roots, marsh\\nplants, and slime, and the extraneous smell of horse dung, Laska\\ndetected at once a smell that pervaded the whole marsh, the scent of\\nthat strong-smelling bird that always excited her more than any other.\\nHere and there among the moss and marsh plants this scent was very\\nstrong, but it was impossible to determine in which direction it grew\\nstronger or fainter. To find the direction, she had to go farther away\\nfrom the wind. Not feeling the motion of her legs, Laska bounded with a\\nstiff gallop, so that at each bound she could stop short, to the right,\\naway from the wind that blew from the east before sunrise, and turned\\nfacing the wind. Sniffing in the air with dilated nostrils, she felt at\\nonce that not their tracks only but they themselves were here before\\nher, and not one, but many. Laska slackened her speed. They were here,\\nbut where precisely she could not yet determine. To find the very spot,\\nshe began to make a circle, when suddenly her master’s voice drew her\\noff. “Laska! here?” he asked, pointing her to a different direction.\\nShe stopped, asking him if she had better not go on doing as she had\\nbegun. But he repeated his command in an angry voice, pointing to a\\nspot covered with water, where there could not be anything. She obeyed\\nhim, pretending she was looking, so as to please him, went round it,\\nand went back to her former position, and was at once aware of the\\nscent again. Now when he was not hindering her, she knew what to do,\\nand without looking at what was under her feet, and to her vexation\\nstumbling over a high stump into the water, but righting herself with\\nher strong, supple legs, she began making the circle which was to make\\nall clear to her. The scent of them reached her, stronger and stronger,\\nand more and more defined, and all at once it became perfectly clear to\\nher that one of them was here, behind this tuft of reeds, five paces in\\nfront of her; she stopped, and her whole body was still and rigid. On\\nher short legs she could see nothing in front of her, but by the scent\\nshe knew it was sitting not more than five paces off. She stood still,\\nfeeling more and more conscious of it, and enjoying it in anticipation.\\nHer tail was stretched straight and tense, and only wagging at the\\nextreme end. Her mouth was slightly open, her ears raised. One ear had\\nbeen turned wrong side out as she ran up, and she breathed heavily but\\nwarily, and still more warily looked round, but more with her eyes than\\nher head, to her master. He was coming along with the face she knew so\\nwell, though the eyes were always terrible to her. He stumbled over the\\nstump as he came, and moved, as she thought, extraordinarily slowly.\\nShe thought he came slowly, but he was running.\\n\\nNoticing Laska’s special attitude as she crouched on the ground, as it\\nwere, scratching big prints with her hind paws, and with her mouth\\nslightly open, Levin knew she was pointing at grouse, and with an\\ninward prayer for luck, especially with the first bird, he ran up to\\nher. Coming quite close up to her, he could from his height look beyond\\nher, and he saw with his eyes what she was seeing with her nose. In a\\nspace between two little thickets, at a couple of yards’ distance, he\\ncould see a grouse. Turning its head, it was listening. Then lightly\\npreening and folding its wings, it disappeared round a corner with a\\nclumsy wag of its tail.\\n\\n“Fetch it, fetch it!” shouted Levin, giving Laska a shove from behind.\\n\\n“But I can’t go,” thought Laska. “Where am I to go? From here I feel\\nthem, but if I move forward I shall know nothing of where they are or\\nwho they are.” But then he shoved her with his knee, and in an excited\\nwhisper said, “Fetch it, Laska.”\\n\\n“Well, if that’s what he wishes, I’ll do it, but I can’t answer for\\nmyself now,” she thought, and darted forward as fast as her legs would\\ncarry her between the thick bushes. She scented nothing now; she could\\nonly see and hear, without understanding anything.\\n\\nTen paces from her former place a grouse rose with a guttural cry and\\nthe peculiar round sound of its wings. And immediately after the shot\\nit splashed heavily with its white breast on the wet mire. Another bird\\ndid not linger, but rose behind Levin without the dog. When Levin\\nturned towards it, it was already some way off. But his shot caught it.\\nFlying twenty paces further, the second grouse rose upwards, and\\nwhirling round like a ball, dropped heavily on a dry place.\\n\\n“Come, this is going to be some good!” thought Levin, packing the warm\\nand fat grouse into his game bag. “Eh, Laska, will it be good?”\\n\\nWhen Levin, after loading his gun, moved on, the sun had fully risen,\\nthough unseen behind the storm-clouds. The moon had lost all of its\\nluster, and was like a white cloud in the sky. Not a single star could\\nbe seen. The sedge, silvery with dew before, now shone like gold. The\\nstagnant pools were all like amber. The blue of the grass had changed\\nto yellow-green. The marsh birds twittered and swarmed about the brook\\nand upon the bushes that glittered with dew and cast long shadows. A\\nhawk woke up and settled on a haycock, turning its head from side to\\nside and looking discontentedly at the marsh. Crows were flying about\\nthe field, and a bare-legged boy was driving the horses to an old man,\\nwho had got up from under his long coat and was combing his hair. The\\nsmoke from the gun was white as milk over the green of the grass.\\n\\nOne of the boys ran up to Levin.\\n\\n“Uncle, there were ducks here yesterday!” he shouted to him, and he\\nwalked a little way off behind him.\\n\\nAnd Levin was doubly pleased, in sight of the boy, who expressed his\\napproval, at killing three snipe, one after another, straight off 13\\n\\nThe sportsman’s saying, that if the first beast or the first bird is\\nnot missed, the day will be lucky, turned out correct.\\n\\nAt ten o’clock Levin, weary, hungry, and happy after a tramp of twenty\\nmiles, returned to his night’s lodging with nineteen head of fine game\\nand one duck, which he tied to his belt, as it would not go into the\\ngame bag. His companions had long been awake, and had had time to get\\nhungry and have breakfast.\\n\\n“Wait a bit, wait a bit, I know there are nineteen,” said Levin,\\ncounting a second time over the grouse and snipe, that looked so much\\nless important now, bent and dry and bloodstained, with heads crooked\\naside, than they did when they were flying.\\n\\nThe number was verified, and Stepan Arkadyevitch’s envy pleased Levin.\\nHe was pleased too on returning to find the man sent by Kitty with a\\nnote was already there.\\n\\n“I am perfectly well and happy. If you were uneasy about me, you can\\nfeel easier than ever. I’ve a new bodyguard, Marya Vlasyevna,”—this was\\nthe midwife, a new and important personage in Levin’s domestic life.\\n“She has come to have a look at me. She found me perfectly well, and we\\nhave kept her till you are back. All are happy and well, and please,\\ndon’t be in a hurry to come back, but, if the sport is good, stay\\nanother day.”\\n\\nThese two pleasures, his lucky shooting and the letter from his wife,\\nwere so great that two slightly disagreeable incidents passed lightly\\nover Levin. One was that the chestnut trace horse, who had been\\nunmistakably overworked on the previous day, was off his feed and out\\nof sorts. The coachman said he was “Overdriven yesterday, Konstantin\\nDmitrievitch. Yes, indeed! driven ten miles with no sense!”\\n\\nThe other unpleasant incident, which for the first minute destroyed his\\ngood humor, though later he laughed at it a great deal, was to find\\nthat of all the provisions Kitty had provided in such abundance that\\none would have thought there was enough for a week, nothing was left.\\nOn his way back, tired and hungry from shooting, Levin had so distinct\\na vision of meat-pies that as he approached the hut he seemed to smell\\nand taste them, as Laska had smelt the game, and he immediately told\\nPhilip to give him some. It appeared that there were no pies left, nor\\neven any chicken.\\n\\n“Well, this fellow’s appetite!” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, laughing and\\npointing at Vassenka Veslovsky. “I never suffer from loss of appetite,\\nbut he’s really marvelous!...”\\n\\n“Well, it can’t be helped,” said Levin, looking gloomily at Veslovsky.\\n“Well, Philip, give me some beef, then.”\\n\\n“The beef’s been eaten, and the bones given to the dogs,” answered\\nPhilip.\\n\\nLevin was so hurt that he said, in a tone of vexation, “You might have\\nleft me something!” and he felt ready to cry.\\n\\n“Then put away the game,” he said in a shaking voice to Philip, trying\\nnot to look at Vassenka, “and cover them with some nettles. And you\\nmight at least ask for some milk for me.”\\n\\nBut when he had drunk some milk, he felt ashamed immediately at having\\nshown his annoyance to a stranger, and he began to laugh at his hungry\\nmortification.\\n\\nIn the evening they went shooting again, and Veslovsky had several\\nsuccessful shots, and in the night they drove home.\\n\\nTheir homeward journey was as lively as their drive out had been.\\nVeslovsky sang songs and related with enjoyment his adventures with the\\npeasants, who had regaled him with vodka, and said to him, “Excuse our\\nhomely ways,” and his night’s adventures with kiss-in-the-ring and the\\nservant-girl and the peasant, who had asked him was he married, and on\\nlearning that he was not, said to him, “Well, mind you don’t run after\\nother men’s wives—you’d better get one of your own.” These words had\\nparticularly amused Veslovsky.\\n\\n“Altogether, I’ve enjoyed our outing awfully. And you, Levin?”\\n\\n“I have, very much,” Levin said quite sincerely. It was particularly\\ndelightful to him to have got rid of the hostility he had been feeling\\ntowards Vassenka Veslovsky at home, and to feel instead the most\\nfriendly disposition to him 14\\n\\nNext day at ten o’clock Levin, who had already gone his rounds, knocked\\nat the room where Vassenka had been put for the night.\\n\\n“_Entrez!_” Veslovsky called to him. “Excuse me, I’ve only just\\nfinished my ablutions,” he said, smiling, standing before him in his\\nunderclothes only.\\n\\n“Don’t mind me, please.” Levin sat down in the window. “Have you slept\\nwell?”\\n\\n“Like the dead. What sort of day is it for shooting?”\\n\\n“What will you take, tea or coffee?”\\n\\n“Neither. I’ll wait till lunch. I’m really ashamed. I suppose the\\nladies are down? A walk now would be capital. You show me your horses.”\\n\\nAfter walking about the garden, visiting the stable, and even doing\\nsome gymnastic exercises together on the parallel bars, Levin returned\\nto the house with his guest, and went with him into the drawing-room.\\n\\n“We had splendid shooting, and so many delightful experiences!” said\\nVeslovsky, going up to Kitty, who was sitting at the samovar. “What a\\npity ladies are cut off from these delights!”\\n\\n“Well, I suppose he must say something to the lady of the house,” Levin\\nsaid to himself. Again he fancied something in the smile, in the\\nall-conquering air with which their guest addressed Kitty....\\n\\nThe princess, sitting on the other side of the table with Marya\\nVlasyevna and Stepan Arkadyevitch, called Levin to her side, and began\\nto talk to him about moving to Moscow for Kitty’s confinement, and\\ngetting ready rooms for them. Just as Levin had disliked all the\\ntrivial preparations for his wedding, as derogatory to the grandeur of\\nthe event, now he felt still more offensive the preparations for the\\napproaching birth, the date of which they reckoned, it seemed, on their\\nfingers. He tried to turn a deaf ear to these discussions of the best\\npatterns of long clothes for the coming baby; tried to turn away and\\navoid seeing the mysterious, endless strips of knitting, the triangles\\nof linen, and so on, to which Dolly attached special importance. The\\nbirth of a son (he was certain it would be a son) which was promised\\nhim, but which he still could not believe in—so marvelous it\\nseemed—presented itself to his mind, on one hand, as a happiness so\\nimmense, and therefore so incredible; on the other, as an event so\\nmysterious, that this assumption of a definite knowledge of what would\\nbe, and consequent preparation for it, as for something ordinary that\\ndid happen to people, jarred on him as confusing and humiliating.\\n\\nBut the princess did not understand his feelings, and put down his\\nreluctance to think and talk about it to carelessness and indifference,\\nand so she gave him no peace. She had commissioned Stepan Arkadyevitch\\nto look at a flat, and now she called Levin up.\\n\\n“I know nothing about it, princess. Do as you think fit,” he said.\\n\\n“You must decide when you will move.”\\n\\n“I really don’t know. I know millions of children are born away from\\nMoscow, and doctors ... why....”\\n\\n“But if so....”\\n\\n“Oh, no, as Kitty wishes.”\\n\\n“We can’t talk to Kitty about it! Do you want me to frighten her? Why,\\nthis spring Natalia Golitzina died from having an ignorant doctor.”\\n\\n“I will do just what you say,” he said gloomily.\\n\\nThe princess began talking to him, but he did not hear her. Though the\\nconversation with the princess had indeed jarred upon him, he was\\ngloomy, not on account of that conversation, but from what he saw at\\nthe samovar.\\n\\n“No, it’s impossible,” he thought, glancing now and then at Vassenka\\nbending over Kitty, telling her something with his charming smile, and\\nat her, flushed and disturbed.\\n\\nThere was something not nice in Vassenka’s attitude, in his eyes, in\\nhis smile. Levin even saw something not nice in Kitty’s attitude and\\nlook. And again the light died away in his eyes. Again, as before, all\\nof a sudden, without the slightest transition, he felt cast down from a\\npinnacle of happiness, peace, and dignity, into an abyss of despair,\\nrage, and humiliation. Again everything and everyone had become hateful\\nto him.\\n\\n“You do just as you think best, princess,” he said again, looking\\nround.\\n\\n“Heavy is the cap of Monomach,” Stepan Arkadyevitch said playfully,\\nhinting, evidently, not simply at the princess’s conversation, but at\\nthe cause of Levin’s agitation, which he had noticed.\\n\\n“How late you are today, Dolly!”\\n\\nEveryone got up to greet Darya Alexandrovna. Vassenka only rose for an\\ninstant, and with the lack of courtesy to ladies characteristic of the\\nmodern young man, he scarcely bowed, and resumed his conversation\\nagain, laughing at something.\\n\\n“I’ve been worried about Masha. She did not sleep well, and is\\ndreadfully tiresome today,” said Dolly.\\n\\nThe conversation Vassenka had started with Kitty was running on the\\nsame lines as on the previous evening, discussing Anna, and whether\\nlove is to be put higher than worldly considerations. Kitty disliked\\nthe conversation, and she was disturbed both by the subject and the\\ntone in which it was conducted, and also by the knowledge of the effect\\nit would have on her husband. But she was too simple and innocent to\\nknow how to cut short this conversation, or even to conceal the\\nsuperficial pleasure afforded her by the young man’s very obvious\\nadmiration. She wanted to stop it, but she did not know what to do.\\nWhatever she did she knew would be observed by her husband, and the\\nworst interpretation put on it. And, in fact, when she asked Dolly what\\nwas wrong with Masha, and Vassenka, waiting till this uninteresting\\nconversation was over, began to gaze indifferently at Dolly, the\\nquestion struck Levin as an unnatural and disgusting piece of\\nhypocrisy.\\n\\n“What do you say, shall we go and look for mushrooms today?” said\\nDolly.\\n\\n“By all means, please, and I shall come too,” said Kitty, and she\\nblushed. She wanted from politeness to ask Vassenka whether he would\\ncome, and she did not ask him. “Where are you going, Kostya?” she asked\\nher husband with a guilty face, as he passed by her with a resolute\\nstep. This guilty air confirmed all his suspicions.\\n\\n“The mechanician came when I was away; I haven’t seen him yet,” he\\nsaid, not looking at her.\\n\\nHe went downstairs, but before he had time to leave his study he heard\\nhis wife’s familiar footsteps running with reckless speed to him.\\n\\n“What do you want?” he said to her shortly. “We are busy.”\\n\\n“I beg your pardon,” she said to the German mechanician; “I want a few\\nwords with my husband.”\\n\\nThe German would have left the room, but Levin said to him:\\n\\n“Don’t disturb yourself.”\\n\\n“The train is at three?” queried the German. “I mustn’t be late.”\\n\\nLevin did not answer him, but walked out himself with his wife.\\n\\n“Well, what have you to say to me?” he said to her in French.\\n\\nHe did not look her in the face, and did not care to see that she in\\nher condition was trembling all over, and had a piteous, crushed look.\\n\\n“I ... I want to say that we can’t go on like this; that this is\\nmisery....” she said.\\n\\n“The servants are here at the sideboard,” he said angrily; “don’t make\\na scene.”\\n\\n“Well, let’s go in here!”\\n\\nThey were standing in the passage. Kitty would have gone into the next\\nroom, but there the English governess was giving Tanya a lesson.\\n\\n“Well, come into the garden.”\\n\\nIn the garden they came upon a peasant weeding the path. And no longer\\nconsidering that the peasant could see her tear-stained and his\\nagitated face, that they looked like people fleeing from some disaster,\\nthey went on with rapid steps, feeling that they must speak out and\\nclear up misunderstandings, must be alone together, and so get rid of\\nthe misery they were both feeling.\\n\\n“We can’t go on like this! It’s misery! I am wretched; you are\\nwretched. What for?” she said, when they had at last reached a solitary\\ngarden seat at a turn in the lime tree avenue.\\n\\n“But tell me one thing: was there in his tone anything unseemly, not\\nnice, humiliatingly horrible?” he said, standing before her again in\\nthe same position with his clenched fists on his chest, as he had stood\\nbefore her that night.\\n\\n“Yes,” she said in a shaking voice; “but, Kostya, surely you see I’m\\nnot to blame? All the morning I’ve been trying to take a tone ... but\\nsuch people.... Why did he come? How happy we were!” she said,\\nbreathless with the sobs that shook her.\\n\\nAlthough nothing had been pursuing them, and there was nothing to run\\naway from, and they could not possibly have found anything very\\ndelightful on that garden seat, the gardener saw with astonishment that\\nthey passed him on their way home with comforted and radiant faces 15\\n\\nAfter escorting his wife upstairs, Levin went to Dolly’s part of the\\nhouse. Darya Alexandrovna, for her part, was in great distress too that\\nday. She was walking about the room, talking angrily to a little girl,\\nwho stood in the corner roaring.\\n\\n“And you shall stand all day in the corner, and have your dinner all\\nalone, and not see one of your dolls, and I won’t make you a new\\nfrock,” she said, not knowing how to punish her.\\n\\n“Oh, she is a disgusting child!” she turned to Levin. “Where does she\\nget such wicked propensities?”\\n\\n“Why, what has she done?” Levin said without much interest, for he had\\nwanted to ask her advice, and so was annoyed that he had come at an\\nunlucky moment.\\n\\n“Grisha and she went into the raspberries, and there ... I can’t tell\\nyou really what she did. It’s a thousand pities Miss Elliot’s not with\\nus. This one sees to nothing—she’s a machine.... _Figurez-vous que la\\npetite_?...”\\n\\nAnd Darya Alexandrovna described Masha’s crime.\\n\\n“That proves nothing; it’s not a question of evil propensities at all,\\nit’s simply mischief,” Levin assured her.\\n\\n“But you are upset about something? What have you come for?” asked\\nDolly. “What’s going on there?”\\n\\nAnd in the tone of her question Levin heard that it would be easy for\\nhim to say what he had meant to say.\\n\\n“I’ve not been in there, I’ve been alone in the garden with Kitty.\\nWe’ve had a quarrel for the second time since ... Stiva came.”\\n\\nDolly looked at him with her shrewd, comprehending eyes.\\n\\n“Come, tell me, honor bright, has there been ... not in Kitty, but in\\nthat gentleman’s behavior, a tone which might be unpleasant—not\\nunpleasant, but horrible, offensive to a husband?”\\n\\n“You mean, how shall I say.... Stay, stay in the corner!” she said to\\nMasha, who, detecting a faint smile in her mother’s face, had been\\nturning round. “The opinion of the world would be that he is behaving\\nas young men do behave. _Il fait la cour à une jeune et jolie femme_,\\nand a husband who’s a man of the world should only be flattered by it.”\\n\\n“Yes, yes,” said Levin gloomily; “but you noticed it?”\\n\\n“Not only I, but Stiva noticed it. Just after breakfast he said to me\\nin so many words, _Je crois que Veslovsky fait un petit brin de cour à\\nKitty_.”\\n\\n“Well, that’s all right then; now I’m satisfied. I’ll send him away,”\\nsaid Levin.\\n\\n“What do you mean! Are you crazy?” Dolly cried in horror; “nonsense,\\nKostya, only think!” she said, laughing. “You can go now to Fanny,” she\\nsaid to Masha. “No, if you wish it, I’ll speak to Stiva. He’ll take him\\naway. He can say you’re expecting visitors. Altogether he doesn’t fit\\ninto the house.”\\n\\n“No, no, I’ll do it myself.”\\n\\n“But you’ll quarrel with him?”\\n\\n“Not a bit. I shall so enjoy it,” Levin said, his eyes flashing with\\nreal enjoyment. “Come, forgive her, Dolly, she won’t do it again,” he\\nsaid of the little sinner, who had not gone to Fanny, but was standing\\nirresolutely before her mother, waiting and looking up from under her\\nbrows to catch her mother’s eye.\\n\\nThe mother glanced at her. The child broke into sobs, hid her face on\\nher mother’s lap, and Dolly laid her thin, tender hand on her head.\\n\\n“And what is there in common between us and him?” thought Levin, and he\\nwent off to look for Veslovsky.\\n\\nAs he passed through the passage he gave orders for the carriage to be\\ngot ready to drive to the station.\\n\\n“The spring was broken yesterday,” said the footman.\\n\\n“Well, the covered trap, then, and make haste. Where’s the visitor?”\\n\\n“The gentleman’s gone to his room.”\\n\\nLevin came upon Veslovsky at the moment when the latter, having\\nunpacked his things from his trunk, and laid out some new songs, was\\nputting on his gaiters to go out riding.\\n\\nWhether there was something exceptional in Levin’s face, or that\\nVassenka was himself conscious that _ce petit brin de cour_ he was\\nmaking was out of place in this family, but he was somewhat (as much as\\na young man in society can be) disconcerted at Levin’s entrance.\\n\\n“You ride in gaiters?”\\n\\n“Yes, it’s much cleaner,” said Vassenka, putting his fat leg on a\\nchair, fastening the bottom hook, and smiling with simple-hearted good\\nhumor.\\n\\nHe was undoubtedly a good-natured fellow, and Levin felt sorry for him\\nand ashamed of himself, as his host, when he saw the shy look on\\nVassenka’s face.\\n\\nOn the table lay a piece of stick which they had broken together that\\nmorning, trying their strength. Levin took the fragment in his hands\\nand began smashing it up, breaking bits off the stick, not knowing how\\nto begin.\\n\\n“I wanted....” He paused, but suddenly, remembering Kitty and\\neverything that had happened, he said, looking him resolutely in the\\nface: “I have ordered the horses to be put-to for you.”\\n\\n“How so?” Vassenka began in surprise. “To drive where?”\\n\\n“For you to drive to the station,” Levin said gloomily.\\n\\n“Are you going away, or has something happened?”\\n\\n“It happens that I expect visitors,” said Levin, his strong fingers\\nmore and more rapidly breaking off the ends of the split stick. “And\\nI’m not expecting visitors, and nothing has happened, but I beg you to\\ngo away. You can explain my rudeness as you like.”\\n\\nVassenka drew himself up.\\n\\n“I beg you to explain....” he said with dignity, understanding at last.\\n\\n“I can’t explain,” Levin said softly and deliberately, trying to\\ncontrol the trembling of his jaw; “and you’d better not ask.”\\n\\nAnd as the split ends were all broken off, Levin clutched the thick\\nends in his finger, broke the stick in two, and carefully caught the\\nend as it fell.\\n\\nProbably the sight of those nervous fingers, of the muscles he had\\nproved that morning at gymnastics, of the glittering eyes, the soft\\nvoice, and quivering jaws, convinced Vassenka better than any words. He\\nbowed, shrugging his shoulders, and smiling contemptuously.\\n\\n“Can I not see Oblonsky?”\\n\\nThe shrug and the smile did not irritate Levin.\\n\\n“What else was there for him to do?” he thought.\\n\\n“I’ll send him to you at once.”\\n\\n“What madness is this?” Stepan Arkadyevitch said when, after hearing\\nfrom his friend that he was being turned out of the house, he found\\nLevin in the garden, where he was walking about waiting for his guest’s\\ndeparture. “_Mais c’est ridicule!_ What fly has stung you? _Mais c’est\\ndu dernier ridicule!_ What did you think, if a young man....”\\n\\nBut the place where Levin had been stung was evidently still sore, for\\nhe turned pale again, when Stepan Arkadyevitch would have enlarged on\\nthe reason, and he himself cut him short.\\n\\n“Please don’t go into it! I can’t help it. I feel ashamed of how I’m\\ntreating you and him. But it won’t be, I imagine, a great grief to him\\nto go, and his presence was distasteful to me and to my wife.”\\n\\n“But it’s insulting to him! _Et puis c’est ridicule_.”\\n\\n“And to me it’s both insulting and distressing! And I’m not at fault in\\nany way, and there’s no need for me to suffer.”\\n\\n“Well, this I didn’t expect of you! _On peut être jaloux, mais à ce\\npoint, c’est du dernier ridicule!_”\\n\\nLevin turned quickly, and walked away from him into the depths of the\\navenue, and he went on walking up and down alone. Soon he heard the\\nrumble of the trap, and saw from behind the trees how Vassenka, sitting\\nin the hay (unluckily there was no seat in the trap) in his Scotch cap,\\nwas driven along the avenue, jolting up and down over the ruts.\\n\\n“What’s this?” Levin thought, when a footman ran out of the house and\\nstopped the trap. It was the mechanician, whom Levin had totally\\nforgotten. The mechanician, bowing low, said something to Veslovsky,\\nthen clambered into the trap, and they drove off together.\\n\\nStepan Arkadyevitch and the princess were much upset by Levin’s action.\\nAnd he himself felt not only in the highest degree _ridicule_, but also\\nutterly guilty and disgraced. But remembering what sufferings he and\\nhis wife had been through, when he asked himself how he should act\\nanother time, he answered that he should do just the same again.\\n\\nIn spite of all this, towards the end of that day, everyone except the\\nprincess, who could not pardon Levin’s action, became extraordinarily\\nlively and good-humored, like children after a punishment or grown-up\\npeople after a dreary, ceremonious reception, so that by the evening\\nVassenka’s dismissal was spoken of, in the absence of the princess, as\\nthough it were some remote event. And Dolly, who had inherited her\\nfather’s gift of humorous storytelling, made Varenka helpless with\\nlaughter as she related for the third and fourth time, always with\\nfresh humorous additions, how she had only just put on her new shoes\\nfor the benefit of the visitor, and on going into the drawing-room,\\nheard suddenly the rumble of the trap. And who should be in the trap\\nbut Vassenka himself, with his Scotch cap, and his songs and his\\ngaiters, and all, sitting in the hay.\\n\\n“If only you’d ordered out the carriage! But no! and then I hear:\\n‘Stop!’ Oh, I thought they’ve relented. I look out, and behold a fat\\nGerman being sat down by him and driving away.... And my new shoes all\\nfor nothing 16\\n\\nDarya Alexandrovna carried out her intention and went to see Anna. She\\nwas sorry to annoy her sister and to do anything Levin disliked. She\\nquite understood how right the Levins were in not wishing to have\\nanything to do with Vronsky. But she felt she must go and see Anna, and\\nshow her that her feelings could not be changed, in spite of the change\\nin her position. That she might be independent of the Levins in this\\nexpedition, Darya Alexandrovna sent to the village to hire horses for\\nthe drive; but Levin learning of it went to her to protest.\\n\\n“What makes you suppose that I dislike your going? But, even if I did\\ndislike it, I should still more dislike your not taking my horses,” he\\nsaid. “You never told me that you were going for certain. Hiring horses\\nin the village is disagreeable to me, and, what’s of more importance,\\nthey’ll undertake the job and never get you there. I have horses. And\\nif you don’t want to wound me, you’ll take mine.”\\n\\nDarya Alexandrovna had to consent, and on the day fixed Levin had ready\\nfor his sister-in-law a set of four horses and relays, getting them\\ntogether from the farm and saddle-horses—not at all a smart-looking\\nset, but capable of taking Darya Alexandrovna the whole distance in a\\nsingle day. At that moment, when horses were wanted for the princess,\\nwho was going, and for the midwife, it was a difficult matter for Levin\\nto make up the number, but the duties of hospitality would not let him\\nallow Darya Alexandrovna to hire horses when staying in his house.\\nMoreover, he was well aware that the twenty roubles that would be asked\\nfor the journey were a serious matter for her; Darya Alexandrovna’s\\npecuniary affairs, which were in a very unsatisfactory state, were\\ntaken to heart by the Levins as if they were their own.\\n\\nDarya Alexandrovna, by Levin’s advice, started before daybreak. The\\nroad was good, the carriage comfortable, the horses trotted along\\nmerrily, and on the box, besides the coachman, sat the counting-house\\nclerk, whom Levin was sending instead of a groom for greater security.\\nDarya Alexandrovna dozed and waked up only on reaching the inn where\\nthe horses were to be changed.\\n\\nAfter drinking tea at the same well-to-do peasant’s with whom Levin had\\nstayed on the way to Sviazhsky’s, and chatting with the women about\\ntheir children, and with the old man about Count Vronsky, whom the\\nlatter praised very highly, Darya Alexandrovna, at ten o’clock, went on\\nagain. At home, looking after her children, she had no time to think.\\nSo now, after this journey of four hours, all the thoughts she had\\nsuppressed before rushed swarming into her brain, and she thought over\\nall her life as she never had before, and from the most different\\npoints of view. Her thoughts seemed strange even to herself. At first\\nshe thought about the children, about whom she was uneasy, although the\\nprincess and Kitty (she reckoned more upon her) had promised to look\\nafter them. “If only Masha does not begin her naughty tricks, if Grisha\\nisn’t kicked by a horse, and Lily’s stomach isn’t upset again!” she\\nthought. But these questions of the present were succeeded by questions\\nof the immediate future. She began thinking how she had to get a new\\nflat in Moscow for the coming winter, to renew the drawing-room\\nfurniture, and to make her elder girl a cloak. Then questions of the\\nmore remote future occurred to her: how she was to place her children\\nin the world. “The girls are all right,” she thought; “but the boys?”\\n\\n“It’s very well that I’m teaching Grisha, but of course that’s only\\nbecause I am free myself now, I’m not with child. Stiva, of course,\\nthere’s no counting on. And with the help of good-natured friends I can\\nbring them up; but if there’s another baby coming?...” And the thought\\nstruck her how untruly it was said that the curse laid on woman was\\nthat in sorrow she should bring forth children.\\n\\n“The birth itself, that’s nothing; but the months of carrying the\\nchild—that’s what’s so intolerable,” she thought, picturing to herself\\nher last pregnancy, and the death of the last baby. And she recalled\\nthe conversation she had just had with the young woman at the inn. On\\nbeing asked whether she had any children, the handsome young woman had\\nanswered cheerfully:\\n\\n“I had a girl baby, but God set me free; I buried her last Lent.”\\n\\n“Well, did you grieve very much for her?” asked Darya Alexandrovna.\\n\\n“Why grieve? The old man has grandchildren enough as it is. It was only\\na trouble. No working, nor nothing. Only a tie.”\\n\\nThis answer had struck Darya Alexandrovna as revolting in spite of the\\ngood-natured and pleasing face of the young woman; but now she could\\nnot help recalling these words. In those cynical words there was indeed\\na grain of truth.\\n\\n“Yes, altogether,” thought Darya Alexandrovna, looking back over her\\nwhole existence during those fifteen years of her married life,\\n“pregnancy, sickness, mental incapacity, indifference to everything,\\nand most of all—hideousness. Kitty, young and pretty as she is, even\\nKitty has lost her looks; and I when I’m with child become hideous, I\\nknow it. The birth, the agony, the hideous agonies, that last moment\\n... then the nursing, the sleepless nights, the fearful pains....”\\n\\nDarya Alexandrovna shuddered at the mere recollection of the pain from\\nsore breasts which she had suffered with almost every child. “Then the\\nchildren’s illnesses, that everlasting apprehension; then bringing them\\nup; evil propensities” (she thought of little Masha’s crime among the\\nraspberries), “education, Latin—it’s all so incomprehensible and\\ndifficult. And on the top of it all, the death of these children.” And\\nthere rose again before her imagination the cruel memory, that always\\ntore her mother’s heart, of the death of her last little baby, who had\\ndied of croup; his funeral, the callous indifference of all at the\\nlittle pink coffin, and her own torn heart, and her lonely anguish at\\nthe sight of the pale little brow with its projecting temples, and the\\nopen, wondering little mouth seen in the coffin at the moment when it\\nwas being covered with the little pink lid with a cross braided on it.\\n\\n“And all this, what’s it for? What is to come of it all? That I’m\\nwasting my life, never having a moment’s peace, either with child, or\\nnursing a child, forever irritable, peevish, wretched myself and\\nworrying others, repulsive to my husband, while the children are\\ngrowing up unhappy, badly educated, and penniless. Even now, if it\\nweren’t for spending the summer at the Levins’, I don’t know how we\\nshould be managing to live. Of course Kostya and Kitty have so much\\ntact that we don’t feel it; but it can’t go on. They’ll have children,\\nthey won’t be able to keep us; it’s a drag on them as it is. How is\\npapa, who has hardly anything left for himself, to help us? So that I\\ncan’t even bring the children up by myself, and may find it hard with\\nthe help of other people, at the cost of humiliation. Why, even if we\\nsuppose the greatest good luck, that the children don’t die, and I\\nbring them up somehow. At the very best they’ll simply be decent\\npeople. That’s all I can hope for. And to gain simply that—what\\nagonies, what toil!... One’s whole life ruined!” Again she recalled\\nwhat the young peasant woman had said, and again she was revolted at\\nthe thought; but she could not help admitting that there was a grain of\\nbrutal truth in the words.\\n\\n“Is it far now, Mihail?” Darya Alexandrovna asked the counting-house\\nclerk, to turn her mind from thoughts that were frightening her.\\n\\n“From this village, they say, it’s five miles.” The carriage drove\\nalong the village street and onto a bridge. On the bridge was a crowd\\nof peasant women with coils of ties for the sheaves on their shoulders,\\ngaily and noisily chattering. They stood still on the bridge, staring\\ninquisitively at the carriage. All the faces turned to Darya\\nAlexandrovna looked to her healthy and happy, making her envious of\\ntheir enjoyment of life. “They’re all living, they’re all enjoying\\nlife,” Darya Alexandrovna still mused when she had passed the peasant\\nwomen and was driving uphill again at a trot, seated comfortably on the\\nsoft springs of the old carriage, “while I, let out, as it were from\\nprison, from the world of worries that fret me to death, am only\\nlooking about me now for an instant. They all live; those peasant women\\nand my sister Natalia and Varenka and Anna, whom I am going to see—all,\\nbut not I.\\n\\n“And they attack Anna. What for? am I any better? I have, anyway, a\\nhusband I love—not as I should like to love him, still I do love him,\\nwhile Anna never loved hers. How is she to blame? She wants to live.\\nGod has put that in our hearts. Very likely I should have done the\\nsame. Even to this day I don’t feel sure I did right in listening to\\nher at that terrible time when she came to me in Moscow. I ought then\\nto have cast off my husband and have begun my life fresh. I might have\\nloved and have been loved in reality. And is it any better as it is? I\\ndon’t respect him. He’s necessary to me,” she thought about her\\nhusband, “and I put up with him. Is that any better? At that time I\\ncould still have been admired, I had beauty left me still,” Darya\\nAlexandrovna pursued her thoughts, and she would have liked to look at\\nherself in the looking-glass. She had a traveling looking-glass in her\\nhandbag, and she wanted to take it out; but looking at the backs of the\\ncoachman and the swaying counting-house clerk, she felt that she would\\nbe ashamed if either of them were to look round, and she did not take\\nout the glass.\\n\\nBut without looking in the glass, she thought that even now it was not\\ntoo late; and she thought of Sergey Ivanovitch, who was always\\nparticularly attentive to her, of Stiva’s good-hearted friend,\\nTurovtsin, who had helped her nurse her children through the\\nscarlatina, and was in love with her. And there was someone else, a\\nquite young man, who—her husband had told her it as a joke—thought her\\nmore beautiful than either of her sisters. And the most passionate and\\nimpossible romances rose before Darya Alexandrovna’s imagination. “Anna\\ndid quite right, and certainly I shall never reproach her for it. She\\nis happy, she makes another person happy, and she’s not broken down as\\nI am, but most likely just as she always was, bright, clever, open to\\nevery impression,” thought Darya Alexandrovna,—and a sly smile curved\\nher lips, for, as she pondered on Anna’s love affair, Darya\\nAlexandrovna constructed on parallel lines an almost identical love\\naffair for herself, with an imaginary composite figure, the ideal man\\nwho was in love with her. She, like Anna, confessed the whole affair to\\nher husband. And the amazement and perplexity of Stepan Arkadyevitch at\\nthis avowal made her smile.\\n\\nIn such daydreams she reached the turning of the highroad that led to\\nVozdvizhenskoe 17\\n\\nThe coachman pulled up his four horses and looked round to the right,\\nto a field of rye, where some peasants were sitting on a cart. The\\ncounting-house clerk was just going to jump down, but on second\\nthoughts he shouted peremptorily to the peasants instead, and beckoned\\nto them to come up. The wind, that seemed to blow as they drove,\\ndropped when the carriage stood still; gadflies settled on the steaming\\nhorses that angrily shook them off. The metallic clank of a whetstone\\nagainst a scythe, that came to them from the cart, ceased. One of the\\npeasants got up and came towards the carriage.\\n\\n“Well, you are slow!” the counting-house clerk shouted angrily to the\\npeasant who was stepping slowly with his bare feet over the ruts of the\\nrough dry road. “Come along, do!”\\n\\nA curly-headed old man with a bit of bast tied round his hair, and his\\nbent back dark with perspiration, came towards the carriage, quickening\\nhis steps, and took hold of the mud-guard with his sunburnt hand.\\n\\n“Vozdvizhenskoe, the manor house? the count’s?” he repeated; “go on to\\nthe end of this track. Then turn to the left. Straight along the avenue\\nand you’ll come right upon it. But whom do you want? The count\\nhimself?”\\n\\n“Well, are they at home, my good man?” Darya Alexandrovna said vaguely,\\nnot knowing how to ask about Anna, even of this peasant.\\n\\n“At home for sure,” said the peasant, shifting from one bare foot to\\nthe other, and leaving a distinct print of five toes and a heel in the\\ndust. “Sure to be at home,” he repeated, evidently eager to talk. “Only\\nyesterday visitors arrived. There’s a sight of visitors come. What do\\nyou want?” He turned round and called to a lad, who was shouting\\nsomething to him from the cart. “Oh! They all rode by here not long\\nsince, to look at a reaping machine. They’ll be home by now. And who\\nwill you be belonging to?...”\\n\\n“We’ve come a long way,” said the coachman, climbing onto the box. “So\\nit’s not far?”\\n\\n“I tell you, it’s just here. As soon as you get out....” he said,\\nkeeping hold all the while of the carriage.\\n\\nA healthy-looking, broad-shouldered young fellow came up too.\\n\\n“What, is it laborers they want for the harvest?” he asked.\\n\\n“I don’t know, my boy.”\\n\\n“So you keep to the left, and you’ll come right on it,” said the\\npeasant, unmistakably loth to let the travelers go, and eager to\\nconverse.\\n\\nThe coachman started the horses, but they were only just turning off\\nwhen the peasant shouted: “Stop! Hi, friend! Stop!” called the two\\nvoices. The coachman stopped.\\n\\n“They’re coming! They’re yonder!” shouted the peasant. “See what a\\nturn-out!” he said, pointing to four persons on horseback, and two in a\\n_char-à-banc_, coming along the road.\\n\\nThey were Vronsky with a jockey, Veslovsky and Anna on horseback, and\\nPrincess Varvara and Sviazhsky in the _char-à-banc_. They had gone out\\nto look at the working of a new reaping machine.\\n\\nWhen the carriage stopped, the party on horseback were coming at a\\nwalking pace. Anna was in front beside Veslovsky. Anna, quietly walking\\nher horse, a sturdy English cob with cropped mane and short tail, her\\nbeautiful head with her black hair straying loose under her high hat,\\nher full shoulders, her slender waist in her black riding habit, and\\nall the ease and grace of her deportment, impressed Dolly.\\n\\nFor the first minute it seemed to her unsuitable for Anna to be on\\nhorseback. The conception of riding on horseback for a lady was, in\\nDarya Alexandrovna’s mind, associated with ideas of youthful flirtation\\nand frivolity, which, in her opinion, was unbecoming in Anna’s\\nposition. But when she had scrutinized her, seeing her closer, she was\\nat once reconciled to her riding. In spite of her elegance, everything\\nwas so simple, quiet, and dignified in the attitude, the dress and the\\nmovements of Anna, that nothing could have been more natural.\\n\\nBeside Anna, on a hot-looking gray cavalry horse, was Vassenka\\nVeslovsky in his Scotch cap with floating ribbons, his stout legs\\nstretched out in front, obviously pleased with his own appearance.\\nDarya Alexandrovna could not suppress a good-humored smile as she\\nrecognized him. Behind rode Vronsky on a dark bay mare, obviously\\nheated from galloping. He was holding her in, pulling at the reins.\\n\\nAfter him rode a little man in the dress of a jockey. Sviazhsky and\\nPrincess Varvara in a new _char-à-banc_ with a big, raven-black\\ntrotting horse, overtook the party on horseback.\\n\\nAnna’s face suddenly beamed with a joyful smile at the instant when, in\\nthe little figure huddled in a corner of the old carriage, she\\nrecognized Dolly. She uttered a cry, started in the saddle, and set her\\nhorse into a gallop. On reaching the carriage she jumped off without\\nassistance, and holding up her riding habit, she ran up to greet Dolly.\\n\\n“I thought it was you and dared not think it. How delightful! You can’t\\nfancy how glad I am!” she said, at one moment pressing her face against\\nDolly and kissing her, and at the next holding her off and examining\\nher with a smile.\\n\\n“Here’s a delightful surprise, Alexey!” she said, looking round at\\nVronsky, who had dismounted, and was walking towards them.\\n\\nVronsky, taking off his tall gray hat, went up to Dolly.\\n\\n“You wouldn’t believe how glad we are to see you,” he said, giving\\npeculiar significance to the words, and showing his strong white teeth\\nin a smile.\\n\\nVassenka Veslovsky, without getting off his horse, took off his cap and\\ngreeted the visitor by gleefully waving the ribbons over his head.\\n\\n“That’s Princess Varvara,” Anna said in reply to a glance of inquiry\\nfrom Dolly as the _char-à-banc_ drove up.\\n\\n“Ah!” said Darya Alexandrovna, and unconsciously her face betrayed her\\ndissatisfaction.\\n\\nPrincess Varvara was her husband’s aunt, and she had long known her,\\nand did not respect her. She knew that Princess Varvara had passed her\\nwhole life toadying on her rich relations, but that she should now be\\nsponging on Vronsky, a man who was nothing to her, mortified Dolly on\\naccount of her kinship with her husband. Anna noticed Dolly’s\\nexpression, and was disconcerted by it. She blushed, dropped her riding\\nhabit, and stumbled over it.\\n\\nDarya Alexandrovna went up to the _char-à-banc_ and coldly greeted\\nPrincess Varvara. Sviazhsky too she knew. He inquired how his queer\\nfriend with the young wife was, and running his eyes over the\\nill-matched horses and the carriage with its patched mud-guards,\\nproposed to the ladies that they should get into the _char-à-banc_.\\n\\n“And I’ll get into this vehicle,” he said. “The horse is quiet, and the\\nprincess drives capitally.”\\n\\n“No, stay as you were,” said Anna, coming up, “and we’ll go in the\\ncarriage,” and taking Dolly’s arm, she drew her away.\\n\\nDarya Alexandrovna’s eyes were fairly dazzled by the elegant carriage\\nof a pattern she had never seen before, the splendid horses, and the\\nelegant and gorgeous people surrounding her. But what struck her most\\nof all was the change that had taken place in Anna, whom she knew so\\nwell and loved. Any other woman, a less close observer, not knowing\\nAnna before, or not having thought as Darya Alexandrovna had been\\nthinking on the road, would not have noticed anything special in Anna.\\nBut now Dolly was struck by that temporary beauty, which is only found\\nin women during the moments of love, and which she saw now in Anna’s\\nface. Everything in her face, the clearly marked dimples in her cheeks\\nand chin, the line of her lips, the smile which, as it were, fluttered\\nabout her face, the brilliance of her eyes, the grace and rapidity of\\nher movements, the fulness of the notes of her voice, even the manner\\nin which, with a sort of angry friendliness, she answered Veslovsky\\nwhen he asked permission to get on her cob, so as to teach it to gallop\\nwith the right leg foremost—it was all peculiarly fascinating, and it\\nseemed as if she were herself aware of it, and rejoicing in it.\\n\\nWhen both the women were seated in the carriage, a sudden embarrassment\\ncame over both of them. Anna was disconcerted by the intent look of\\ninquiry Dolly fixed upon her. Dolly was embarrassed because after\\nSviazhsky’s phrase about “this vehicle,” she could not help feeling\\nashamed of the dirty old carriage in which Anna was sitting with her.\\nThe coachman Philip and the counting-house clerk were experiencing the\\nsame sensation. The counting-house clerk, to conceal his confusion,\\nbusied himself settling the ladies, but Philip the coachman became\\nsullen, and was bracing himself not to be overawed in future by this\\nexternal superiority. He smiled ironically, looking at the raven horse,\\nand was already deciding in his own mind that this smart trotter in the\\n_char-à-banc_ was only good for _promenage_, and wouldn’t do thirty\\nmiles straight off in the heat.\\n\\nThe peasants had all got up from the cart and were inquisitively and\\nmirthfully staring at the meeting of the friends, making their comments\\non it.\\n\\n“They’re pleased, too; haven’t seen each other for a long while,” said\\nthe curly-headed old man with the bast round his hair.\\n\\n“I say, Uncle Gerasim, if we could take that raven horse now, to cart\\nthe corn, that ’ud be quick work!”\\n\\n“Look-ee! Is that a woman in breeches?” said one of them, pointing to\\nVassenka Veslovsky sitting in a side saddle.\\n\\n“Nay, a man! See how smartly he’s going it!”\\n\\n“Eh, lads! seems we’re not going to sleep, then?”\\n\\n“What chance of sleep today!” said the old man, with a sidelong look at\\nthe sun. “Midday’s past, look-ee! Get your hooks, and come along 18\\n\\nAnna looked at Dolly’s thin, care-worn face, with its wrinkles filled\\nwith dust from the road, and she was on the point of saying what she\\nwas thinking, that is, that Dolly had got thinner. But, conscious that\\nshe herself had grown handsomer, and that Dolly’s eyes were telling her\\nso, she sighed and began to speak about herself.\\n\\n“You are looking at me,” she said, “and wondering how I can be happy in\\nmy position? Well! it’s shameful to confess, but I ... I’m inexcusably\\nhappy. Something magical has happened to me, like a dream, when you’re\\nfrightened, panic-stricken, and all of a sudden you wake up and all the\\nhorrors are no more. I have waked up. I have lived through the misery,\\nthe dread, and now for a long while past, especially since we’ve been\\nhere, I’ve been so happy!...” she said, with a timid smile of inquiry\\nlooking at Dolly.\\n\\n“How glad I am!” said Dolly smiling, involuntarily speaking more coldly\\nthan she wanted to. “I’m very glad for you. Why haven’t you written to\\nme?”\\n\\n“Why?... Because I hadn’t the courage.... You forget my position....”\\n\\n“To me? Hadn’t the courage? If you knew how I ... I look at....”\\n\\nDarya Alexandrovna wanted to express her thoughts of the morning, but\\nfor some reason it seemed to her now out of place to do so.\\n\\n“But of that we’ll talk later. What’s this, what are all these\\nbuildings?” she asked, wanting to change the conversation and pointing\\nto the red and green roofs that came into view behind the green hedges\\nof acacia and lilac. “Quite a little town.”\\n\\nBut Anna did not answer.\\n\\n“No, no! How do you look at my position, what do you think of it?” she\\nasked.\\n\\n“I consider....” Darya Alexandrovna was beginning, but at that instant\\nVassenka Veslovsky, having brought the cob to gallop with the right leg\\nforemost, galloped past them, bumping heavily up and down in his short\\njacket on the chamois leather of the side saddle. “He’s doing it, Anna\\nArkadyevna!” he shouted.\\n\\nAnna did not even glance at him; but again it seemed to Darya\\nAlexandrovna out of place to enter upon such a long conversation in the\\ncarriage, and so she cut short her thought.\\n\\n“I don’t think anything,” she said, “but I always loved you, and if one\\nloves anyone, one loves the whole person, just as they are and not as\\none would like them to be....”\\n\\nAnna, taking her eyes off her friend’s face and dropping her eyelids\\n(this was a new habit Dolly had not seen in her before), pondered,\\ntrying to penetrate the full significance of the words. And obviously\\ninterpreting them as she would have wished, she glanced at Dolly.\\n\\n“If you had any sins,” she said, “they would all be forgiven you for\\nyour coming to see me and these words.”\\n\\nAnd Dolly saw that tears stood in her eyes. She pressed Anna’s hand in\\nsilence.\\n\\n“Well, what are these buildings? How many there are of them!” After a\\nmoment’s silence she repeated her question.\\n\\n“These are the servants’ houses, barns, and stables,” answered Anna.\\n“And there the park begins. It had all gone to ruin, but Alexey had\\neverything renewed. He is very fond of this place, and, what I never\\nexpected, he has become intensely interested in looking after it. But\\nhis is such a rich nature! Whatever he takes up, he does splendidly. So\\nfar from being bored by it, he works with passionate interest. He—with\\nhis temperament as I know it—he has become careful and businesslike, a\\nfirst-rate manager, he positively reckons every penny in his management\\nof the land. But only in that. When it’s a question of tens of\\nthousands, he doesn’t think of money.” She spoke with that gleefully\\nsly smile with which women often talk of the secret characteristics\\nonly known to them—of those they love. “Do you see that big building?\\nthat’s the new hospital. I believe it will cost over a hundred\\nthousand; that’s his hobby just now. And do you know how it all came\\nabout? The peasants asked him for some meadowland, I think it was, at a\\ncheaper rate, and he refused, and I accused him of being miserly. Of\\ncourse it was not really because of that, but everything together, he\\nbegan this hospital to prove, do you see, that he was not miserly about\\nmoney. _C’est une petitesse_, if you like, but I love him all the more\\nfor it. And now you’ll see the house in a moment. It was his\\ngrandfather’s house, and he has had nothing changed outside.”\\n\\n“How beautiful!” said Dolly, looking with involuntary admiration at the\\nhandsome house with columns, standing out among the different-colored\\ngreens of the old trees in the garden.\\n\\n“Isn’t it fine? And from the house, from the top, the view is\\nwonderful.”\\n\\nThey drove into a courtyard strewn with gravel and bright with flowers,\\nin which two laborers were at work putting an edging of stones round\\nthe light mould of a flower bed, and drew up in a covered entry.\\n\\n“Ah, they’re here already!” said Anna, looking at the saddle horses,\\nwhich were just being led away from the steps. “It is a nice horse,\\nisn’t it? It’s my cob; my favorite. Lead him here and bring me some\\nsugar. Where is the count?” she inquired of two smart footmen who\\ndarted out. “Ah, there he is!” she said, seeing Vronsky coming to meet\\nher with Veslovsky.\\n\\n“Where are you going to put the princess?” said Vronsky in French,\\naddressing Anna, and without waiting for a reply, he once more greeted\\nDarya Alexandrovna, and this time he kissed her hand. “I think the big\\nbalcony room.”\\n\\n“Oh, no, that’s too far off! Better in the corner room, we shall see\\neach other more. Come, let’s go up,” said Anna, as she gave her\\nfavorite horse the sugar the footman had brought her.\\n\\n“_Et vous oubliez votre devoir_,” she said to Veslovsky, who came out\\ntoo on the steps.\\n\\n“_Pardon, j’en ai tout plein les poches_,” he answered, smiling,\\nputting his fingers in his waistcoat pocket.\\n\\n“_Mais vous venez trop tard_,” she said, rubbing her handkerchief on\\nher hand, which the horse had made wet in taking the sugar.\\n\\nAnna turned to Dolly. “You can stay some time? For one day only? That’s\\nimpossible!”\\n\\n“I promised to be back, and the children....” said Dolly, feeling\\nembarrassed both because she had to get her bag out of the carriage,\\nand because she knew her face must be covered with dust.\\n\\n“No, Dolly, darling!... Well, we’ll see. Come along, come along!” and\\nAnna led Dolly to her room.\\n\\nThat room was not the smart guest chamber Vronsky had suggested, but\\nthe one of which Anna had said that Dolly would excuse it. And this\\nroom, for which excuse was needed, was more full of luxury than any in\\nwhich Dolly had ever stayed, a luxury that reminded her of the best\\nhotels abroad.\\n\\n“Well, darling, how happy I am!” Anna said, sitting down in her riding\\nhabit for a moment beside Dolly. “Tell me about all of you. Stiva I had\\nonly a glimpse of, and he cannot tell one about the children. How is my\\nfavorite, Tanya? Quite a big girl, I expect?”\\n\\n“Yes, she’s very tall,” Darya Alexandrovna answered shortly, surprised\\nherself that she should respond so coolly about her children. “We are\\nhaving a delightful stay at the Levins’,” she added.\\n\\n“Oh, if I had known,” said Anna, “that you do not despise me!... You\\nmight have all come to us. Stiva’s an old friend and a great friend of\\nAlexey’s, you know,” she added, and suddenly she blushed.\\n\\n“Yes, but we are all....” Dolly answered in confusion.\\n\\n“But in my delight I’m talking nonsense. The one thing, darling, is\\nthat I am so glad to have you!” said Anna, kissing her again. “You\\nhaven’t told me yet how and what you think about me, and I keep wanting\\nto know. But I’m glad you will see me as I am. The chief thing I\\nshouldn’t like would be for people to imagine I want to prove anything.\\nI don’t want to prove anything; I merely want to live, to do no one\\nharm but myself. I have the right to do that, haven’t I? But it is a\\nbig subject, and we’ll talk over everything properly later. Now I’ll go\\nand dress and send a maid to you 19\\n\\nLeft alone, Darya Alexandrovna, with a good housewife’s eye, scanned\\nher room. All she had seen in entering the house and walking through\\nit, and all she saw now in her room, gave her an impression of wealth\\nand sumptuousness and of that modern European luxury of which she had\\nonly read in English novels, but had never seen in Russia and in the\\ncountry. Everything was new from the new French hangings on the walls\\nto the carpet which covered the whole floor. The bed had a spring\\nmattress, and a special sort of bolster and silk pillowcases on the\\nlittle pillows. The marble washstand, the dressing table, the little\\nsofa, the tables, the bronze clock on the chimney piece, the window\\ncurtains, and the _portières_ were all new and expensive.\\n\\nThe smart maid, who came in to offer her services, with her hair done\\nup high, and a gown more fashionable than Dolly’s, was as new and\\nexpensive as the whole room. Darya Alexandrovna liked her neatness, her\\ndeferential and obliging manners, but she felt ill at ease with her.\\nShe felt ashamed of her seeing the patched dressing jacket that had\\nunluckily been packed by mistake for her. She was ashamed of the very\\npatches and darned places of which she had been so proud at home. At\\nhome it had been so clear that for six dressing jackets there would be\\nneeded twenty-four yards of nainsook at sixteen pence the yard, which\\nwas a matter of thirty shillings besides the cutting-out and making,\\nand these thirty shillings had been saved. But before the maid she\\nfelt, if not exactly ashamed, at least uncomfortable.\\n\\nDarya Alexandrovna had a great sense of relief when Annushka, whom she\\nhad known for years, walked in. The smart maid was sent for to go to\\nher mistress, and Annushka remained with Darya Alexandrovna.\\n\\nAnnushka was obviously much pleased at that lady’s arrival, and began\\nto chatter away without a pause. Dolly observed that she was longing to\\nexpress her opinion in regard to her mistress’s position, especially as\\nto the love and devotion of the count to Anna Arkadyevna, but Dolly\\ncarefully interrupted her whenever she began to speak about this.\\n\\n“I grew up with Anna Arkadyevna; my lady’s dearer to me than anything.\\nWell, it’s not for us to judge. And, to be sure, there seems so much\\nlove....”\\n\\n“Kindly pour out the water for me to wash now, please,” Darya\\nAlexandrovna cut her short.\\n\\n“Certainly. We’ve two women kept specially for washing small things,\\nbut most of the linen’s done by machinery. The count goes into\\neverything himself. Ah, what a husband!...”\\n\\nDolly was glad when Anna came in, and by her entrance put a stop to\\nAnnushka’s gossip.\\n\\nAnna had put on a very simple batiste gown. Dolly scrutinized that\\nsimple gown attentively. She knew what it meant, and the price at which\\nsuch simplicity was obtained.\\n\\n“An old friend,” said Anna of Annushka.\\n\\nAnna was not embarrassed now. She was perfectly composed and at ease.\\nDolly saw that she had now completely recovered from the impression her\\narrival had made on her, and had assumed that superficial, careless\\ntone which, as it were, closed the door on that compartment in which\\nher deeper feelings and ideas were kept.\\n\\n“Well, Anna, and how is your little girl?” asked Dolly.\\n\\n“Annie?” (This was what she called her little daughter Anna.) “Very\\nwell. She has got on wonderfully. Would you like to see her? Come, I’ll\\nshow her to you. We had a terrible bother,” she began telling her,\\n“over nurses. We had an Italian wet-nurse. A good creature, but so\\nstupid! We wanted to get rid of her, but the baby is so used to her\\nthat we’ve gone on keeping her still.”\\n\\n“But how have you managed?...” Dolly was beginning a question as to\\nwhat name the little girl would have; but noticing a sudden frown on\\nAnna’s face, she changed the drift of her question.\\n\\n“How did you manage? have you weaned her yet?”\\n\\nBut Anna had understood.\\n\\n“You didn’t mean to ask that? You meant to ask about her surname. Yes?\\nThat worries Alexey. She has no name—that is, she’s a Karenina,” said\\nAnna, dropping her eyelids till nothing could be seen but the eyelashes\\nmeeting. “But we’ll talk about all that later,” her face suddenly\\nbrightening. “Come, I’ll show you her. _Elle est très gentille_. She\\ncrawls now.”\\n\\nIn the nursery the luxury which had impressed Dolly in the whole house\\nstruck her still more. There were little go-carts ordered from England,\\nand appliances for learning to walk, and a sofa after the fashion of a\\nbilliard table, purposely constructed for crawling, and swings and\\nbaths, all of special pattern, and modern. They were all English,\\nsolid, and of good make, and obviously very expensive. The room was\\nlarge, and very light and lofty.\\n\\nWhen they went in, the baby, with nothing on but her little smock, was\\nsitting in a little elbow chair at the table, having her dinner of\\nbroth, which she was spilling all over her little chest. The baby was\\nbeing fed, and the Russian nursery maid was evidently sharing her meal.\\nNeither the wet-nurse nor the head-nurse were there; they were in the\\nnext room, from which came the sound of their conversation in the queer\\nFrench which was their only means of communication.\\n\\nHearing Anna’s voice, a smart, tall, English nurse with a disagreeable\\nface and a dissolute expression walked in at the door, hurriedly\\nshaking her fair curls, and immediately began to defend herself though\\nAnna had not found fault with her. At every word Anna said, the English\\nnurse said hurriedly several times, “Yes, my lady.”\\n\\nThe rosy baby with her black eyebrows and hair, her sturdy red little\\nbody with tight goose-flesh skin, delighted Darya Alexandrovna in spite\\nof the cross expression with which she stared at the stranger. She\\npositively envied the baby’s healthy appearance. She was delighted,\\ntoo, at the baby’s crawling. Not one of her own children had crawled\\nlike that. When the baby was put on the carpet and its little dress\\ntucked up behind, it was wonderfully charming. Looking round like some\\nlittle wild animal at the grown-up big people with her bright black\\neyes, she smiled, unmistakably pleased at their admiring her, and\\nholding her legs sideways, she pressed vigorously on her arms, and\\nrapidly drew her whole back up after, and then made another step\\nforward with her little arms.\\n\\nBut the whole atmosphere of the nursery, and especially the English\\nnurse, Darya Alexandrovna did not like at all. It was only on the\\nsupposition that no good nurse would have entered so irregular a\\nhousehold as Anna’s that Darya Alexandrovna could explain to herself\\nhow Anna with her insight into people could take such an\\nunprepossessing, disreputable-looking woman as nurse to her child.\\n\\nBesides, from a few words that were dropped, Darya Alexandrovna saw at\\nonce that Anna, the two nurses, and the child had no common existence,\\nand that the mother’s visit was something exceptional. Anna wanted to\\nget the baby her plaything, and could not find it.\\n\\nMost amazing of all was the fact that on being asked how many teeth the\\nbaby had, Anna answered wrong, and knew nothing about the two last\\nteeth.\\n\\n“I sometimes feel sorry I’m so superfluous here,” said Anna, going out\\nof the nursery and holding up her skirt so as to escape the plaything\\nstanding in the doorway. “It was very different with my first child.”\\n\\n“I expected it to be the other way,” said Darya Alexandrovna shyly.\\n\\n“Oh, no! By the way, do you know I saw Seryozha?” said Anna, screwing\\nup her eyes, as though looking at something far away. “But we’ll talk\\nabout that later. You wouldn’t believe it, I’m like a hungry beggar\\nwoman when a full dinner is set before her, and she does not know what\\nto begin on first. The dinner is you, and the talks I have before me\\nwith you, which I could never have with anyone else; and I don’t know\\nwhich subject to begin upon first. _Mais je ne vous ferai grâce de\\nrien_. I must have everything out with you.”\\n\\n“Oh, I ought to give you a sketch of the company you will meet with\\nus,” she went on. “I’ll begin with the ladies. Princess Varvara—you\\nknow her, and I know your opinion and Stiva’s about her. Stiva says the\\nwhole aim of her existence is to prove her superiority over Auntie\\nKaterina Pavlovna: that’s all true; but she’s a good-natured woman, and\\nI am so grateful to her. In Petersburg there was a moment when a\\nchaperon was absolutely essential for me. Then she turned up. But\\nreally she is good-natured. She did a great deal to alleviate my\\nposition. I see you don’t understand all the difficulty of my position\\n... there in Petersburg,” she added. “Here I’m perfectly at ease and\\nhappy. Well, of that later on, though. Then Sviazhsky—he’s the marshal\\nof the district, and he’s a very good sort of a man, but he wants to\\nget something out of Alexey. You understand, with his property, now\\nthat we are settled in the country, Alexey can exercise great\\ninfluence. Then there’s Tushkevitch—you have seen him, you know—Betsy’s\\nadmirer. Now he’s been thrown over and he’s come to see us. As Alexey\\nsays, he’s one of those people who are very pleasant if one accepts\\nthem for what they try to appear to be, _et puis il est comme il faut_,\\nas Princess Varvara says. Then Veslovsky ... you know him. A very nice\\nboy,” she said, and a sly smile curved her lips. “What’s this wild\\nstory about him and the Levins? Veslovsky told Alexey about it, and we\\ndon’t believe it. _Il est très gentil et naïf_,” she said again with\\nthe same smile. “Men need occupation, and Alexey needs a circle, so I\\nvalue all these people. We have to have the house lively and gay, so\\nthat Alexey may not long for any novelty. Then you’ll see the steward—a\\nGerman, a very good fellow, and he understands his work. Alexey has a\\nvery high opinion of him. Then the doctor, a young man, not quite a\\nNihilist perhaps, but you know, eats with his knife ... but a very good\\ndoctor. Then the architect.... _Une petite cour!_ 20\\n\\n“Here’s Dolly for you, princess, you were so anxious to see her,” said\\nAnna, coming out with Darya Alexandrovna onto the stone terrace where\\nPrincess Varvara was sitting in the shade at an embroidery frame,\\nworking at a cover for Count Alexey Kirillovitch’s easy chair. “She\\nsays she doesn’t want anything before dinner, but please order some\\nlunch for her, and I’ll go and look for Alexey and bring them all in.”\\n\\nPrincess Varvara gave Dolly a cordial and rather patronizing reception,\\nand began at once explaining to her that she was living with Anna\\nbecause she had always cared more for her than her sister Katerina\\nPavlovna, the aunt that had brought Anna up, and that now, when\\neveryone had abandoned Anna, she thought it her duty to help her in\\nthis most difficult period of transition.\\n\\n“Her husband will give her a divorce, and then I shall go back to my\\nsolitude; but now I can be of use, and I am doing my duty, however\\ndifficult it may be for me—not like some other people. And how sweet it\\nis of you, how right of you to have come! They live like the best of\\nmarried couples; it’s for God to judge them, not for us. And didn’t\\nBiryuzovsky and Madame Avenieva ... and Sam Nikandrov, and Vassiliev\\nand Madame Mamonova, and Liza Neptunova.... Did no one say anything\\nabout them? And it has ended by their being received by everyone. And\\nthen, _c’est un intérieur si joli, si comme il faut. Tout-à-fait à\\nl’anglaise. On se réunit le matin au breakfast, et puis on se sépare._\\nEveryone does as he pleases till dinner time. Dinner at seven o’clock.\\nStiva did very rightly to send you. He needs their support. You know\\nthat through his mother and brother he can do anything. And then they\\ndo so much good. He didn’t tell you about his hospital? _Ce sera\\nadmirable_—everything from Paris.”\\n\\nTheir conversation was interrupted by Anna, who had found the men of\\nthe party in the billiard room, and returned with them to the terrace.\\nThere was still a long time before the dinner-hour, it was exquisite\\nweather, and so several different methods of spending the next two\\nhours were proposed. There were very many methods of passing the time\\nat Vozdvizhenskoe, and these were all unlike those in use at\\nPokrovskoe.\\n\\n“_Une partie de lawn-tennis,_” Veslovsky proposed, with his handsome\\nsmile. “We’ll be partners again, Anna Arkadyevna.”\\n\\n“No, it’s too hot; better stroll about the garden and have a row in the\\nboat, show Darya Alexandrovna the river banks.” Vronsky proposed.\\n\\n“I agree to anything,” said Sviazhsky.\\n\\n“I imagine that what Dolly would like best would be a stroll—wouldn’t\\nyou? And then the boat, perhaps,” said Anna.\\n\\nSo it was decided. Veslovsky and Tushkevitch went off to the bathing\\nplace, promising to get the boat ready and to wait there for them.\\n\\nThey walked along the path in two couples, Anna with Sviazhsky, and\\nDolly with Vronsky. Dolly was a little embarrassed and anxious in the\\nnew surroundings in which she found herself. Abstractly, theoretically,\\nshe did not merely justify, she positively approved of Anna’s conduct.\\nAs is indeed not unfrequent with women of unimpeachable virtue, weary\\nof the monotony of respectable existence, at a distance she not only\\nexcused illicit love, she positively envied it. Besides, she loved Anna\\nwith all her heart. But seeing Anna in actual life among these\\nstrangers, with this fashionable tone that was so new to Darya\\nAlexandrovna, she felt ill at ease. What she disliked particularly was\\nseeing Princess Varvara ready to overlook everything for the sake of\\nthe comforts she enjoyed.\\n\\nAs a general principle, abstractly, Dolly approved of Anna’s action;\\nbut to see the man for whose sake her action had been taken was\\ndisagreeable to her. Moreover, she had never liked Vronsky. She thought\\nhim very proud, and saw nothing in him of which he could be proud\\nexcept his wealth. But against her own will, here in his own house, he\\noverawed her more than ever, and she could not be at ease with him. She\\nfelt with him the same feeling she had had with the maid about her\\ndressing jacket. Just as with the maid she had felt not exactly\\nashamed, but embarrassed at her darns, so she felt with him not exactly\\nashamed, but embarrassed at herself.\\n\\nDolly was ill at ease, and tried to find a subject of conversation.\\nEven though she supposed that, through his pride, praise of his house\\nand garden would be sure to be disagreeable to him, she did all the\\nsame tell him how much she liked his house.\\n\\n“Yes, it’s a very fine building, and in the good old-fashioned style,”\\nhe said.\\n\\n“I like so much the court in front of the steps. Was that always so?”\\n\\n“Oh, no!” he said, and his face beamed with pleasure. “If you could\\nonly have seen that court last spring!”\\n\\nAnd he began, at first rather diffidently, but more and more carried\\naway by the subject as he went on, to draw her attention to the various\\ndetails of the decoration of his house and garden. It was evident that,\\nhaving devoted a great deal of trouble to improve and beautify his\\nhome, Vronsky felt a need to show off the improvements to a new person,\\nand was genuinely delighted at Darya Alexandrovna’s praise.\\n\\n“If you would care to look at the hospital, and are not tired, indeed,\\nit’s not far. Shall we go?” he said, glancing into her face to convince\\nhimself that she was not bored. “Are you coming, Anna?” he turned to\\nher.\\n\\n“We will come, won’t we?” she said, addressing Sviazhsky. “_Mais il ne\\nfaut pas laisser le pauvre Veslovsky et Tushkevitch se morfondre là\\ndans le bateau._ We must send and tell them.”\\n\\n“Yes, this is a monument he is setting up here,” said Anna, turning to\\nDolly with that sly smile of comprehension with which she had\\npreviously talked about the hospital.\\n\\n“Oh, it’s a work of real importance!” said Sviazhsky. But to show he\\nwas not trying to ingratiate himself with Vronsky, he promptly added\\nsome slightly critical remarks.\\n\\n“I wonder, though, count,” he said, “that while you do so much for the\\nhealth of the peasants, you take so little interest in the schools.”\\n\\n“_C’est devenu tellement commun les écoles,_” said Vronsky. “You\\nunderstand it’s not on that account, but it just happens so, my\\ninterest has been diverted elsewhere. This way then to the hospital,”\\nhe said to Darya Alexandrovna, pointing to a turning out of the avenue.\\n\\nThe ladies put up their parasols and turned into the side path. After\\ngoing down several turnings, and going through a little gate, Darya\\nAlexandrovna saw standing on rising ground before her a large\\npretentious-looking red building, almost finished. The iron roof, which\\nwas not yet painted, shone with dazzling brightness in the sunshine.\\nBeside the finished building another had been begun, surrounded by\\nscaffolding. Workmen in aprons, standing on scaffolds, were laying\\nbricks, pouring mortar out of vats, and smoothing it with trowels.\\n\\n“How quickly work gets done with you!” said Sviazhsky. “When I was here\\nlast time the roof was not on.”\\n\\n“By the autumn it will all be ready. Inside almost everything is done,”\\nsaid Anna.\\n\\n“And what’s this new building?”\\n\\n“That’s the house for the doctor and the dispensary,” answered Vronsky,\\nseeing the architect in a short jacket coming towards him; and excusing\\nhimself to the ladies, he went to meet him.\\n\\nGoing round a hole where the workmen were slaking lime, he stood still\\nwith the architect and began talking rather warmly.\\n\\n“The front is still too low,” he said to Anna, who had asked what was\\nthe matter.\\n\\n“I said the foundation ought to be raised,” said Anna.\\n\\n“Yes, of course it would have been much better, Anna Arkadyevna,” said\\nthe architect, “but now it’s too late.”\\n\\n“Yes, I take a great interest in it,” Anna answered Sviazhsky, who was\\nexpressing his surprise at her knowledge of architecture. “This new\\nbuilding ought to have been in harmony with the hospital. It was an\\nafterthought, and was begun without a plan.”\\n\\nVronsky, having finished his talk with the architect, joined the\\nladies, and led them inside the hospital.\\n\\nAlthough they were still at work on the cornices outside and were\\npainting on the ground floor, upstairs almost all the rooms were\\nfinished. Going up the broad cast-iron staircase to the landing, they\\nwalked into the first large room. The walls were stuccoed to look like\\nmarble, the huge plate-glass windows were already in, only the parquet\\nfloor was not yet finished, and the carpenters, who were planing a\\nblock of it, left their work, taking off the bands that fastened their\\nhair, to greet the gentry.\\n\\n“This is the reception room,” said Vronsky. “Here there will be a desk,\\ntables, and benches, and nothing more.”\\n\\n“This way; let us go in here. Don’t go near the window,” said Anna,\\ntrying the paint to see if it were dry. “Alexey, the paint’s dry\\nalready,” she added.\\n\\nFrom the reception room they went into the corridor. Here Vronsky\\nshowed them the mechanism for ventilation on a novel system. Then he\\nshowed them marble baths, and beds with extraordinary springs. Then he\\nshowed them the wards one after another, the storeroom, the linen room,\\nthen the heating stove of a new pattern, then the trolleys, which would\\nmake no noise as they carried everything needed along the corridors,\\nand many other things. Sviazhsky, as a connoisseur in the latest\\nmechanical improvements, appreciated everything fully. Dolly simply\\nwondered at all she had not seen before, and, anxious to understand it\\nall, made minute inquiries about everything, which gave Vronsky great\\nsatisfaction.\\n\\n“Yes, I imagine that this will be the solitary example of a properly\\nfitted hospital in Russia,” said Sviazhsky.\\n\\n“And won’t you have a lying-in ward?” asked Dolly. “That’s so much\\nneeded in the country. I have often....”\\n\\nIn spite of his usual courtesy, Vronsky interrupted her.\\n\\n“This is not a lying-in home, but a hospital for the sick, and is\\nintended for all diseases, except infectious complaints,” he said. “Ah!\\nlook at this,” and he rolled up to Darya Alexandrovna an invalid chair\\nthat had just been ordered for the convalescents. “Look.” He sat down\\nin the chair and began moving it. “The patient can’t walk—still too\\nweak, perhaps, or something wrong with his legs, but he must have air,\\nand he moves, rolls himself along....”\\n\\nDarya Alexandrovna was interested by everything. She liked everything\\nvery much, but most of all she liked Vronsky himself with his natural,\\nsimple-hearted eagerness. “Yes, he’s a very nice, good man,” she\\nthought several times, not hearing what he said, but looking at him and\\npenetrating into his expression, while she mentally put herself in\\nAnna’s place. She liked him so much just now with his eager interest\\nthat she saw how Anna could be in love with him 21\\n\\n“No, I think the princess is tired, and horses don’t interest her,”\\nVronsky said to Anna, who wanted to go on to the stables, where\\nSviazhsky wished to see the new stallion. “You go on, while I escort\\nthe princess home, and we’ll have a little talk,” he said, “if you\\nwould like that?” he added, turning to her.\\n\\n“I know nothing about horses, and I shall be delighted,” answered Darya\\nAlexandrovna, rather astonished.\\n\\nShe saw by Vronsky’s face that he wanted something from her. She was\\nnot mistaken. As soon as they had passed through the little gate back\\ninto the garden, he looked in the direction Anna had taken, and having\\nmade sure that she could neither hear nor see them, he began:\\n\\n“You guess that I have something I want to say to you,” he said,\\nlooking at her with laughing eyes. “I am not wrong in believing you to\\nbe a friend of Anna’s.” He took off his hat, and taking out his\\nhandkerchief, wiped his head, which was growing bald.\\n\\nDarya Alexandrovna made no answer, and merely stared at him with\\ndismay. When she was left alone with him, she suddenly felt afraid; his\\nlaughing eyes and stern expression scared her.\\n\\nThe most diverse suppositions as to what he was about to speak of to\\nher flashed into her brain. “He is going to beg me to come to stay with\\nthem with the children, and I shall have to refuse; or to create a set\\nthat will receive Anna in Moscow.... Or isn’t it Vassenka Veslovsky and\\nhis relations with Anna? Or perhaps about Kitty, that he feels he was\\nto blame?” All her conjectures were unpleasant, but she did not guess\\nwhat he really wanted to talk about to her.\\n\\n“You have so much influence with Anna, she is so fond of you,” he said;\\n“do help me.”\\n\\nDarya Alexandrovna looked with timid inquiry into his energetic face,\\nwhich under the lime-trees was continually being lighted up in patches\\nby the sunshine, and then passing into complete shadow again. She\\nwaited for him to say more, but he walked in silence beside her,\\nscratching with his cane in the gravel.\\n\\n“You have come to see us, you, the only woman of Anna’s former\\nfriends—I don’t count Princess Varvara—but I know that you have done\\nthis not because you regard our position as normal, but because,\\nunderstanding all the difficulty of the position, you still love her\\nand want to be a help to her. Have I understood you rightly?” he asked,\\nlooking round at her.\\n\\n“Oh, yes,” answered Darya Alexandrovna, putting down her sunshade,\\n“but....”\\n\\n“No,” he broke in, and unconsciously, oblivious of the awkward position\\ninto which he was putting his companion, he stopped abruptly, so that\\nshe had to stop short too. “No one feels more deeply and intensely than\\nI do all the difficulty of Anna’s position; and that you may well\\nunderstand, if you do me the honor of supposing I have any heart. I am\\nto blame for that position, and that is why I feel it.”\\n\\n“I understand,” said Darya Alexandrovna, involuntarily admiring the\\nsincerity and firmness with which he said this. “But just because you\\nfeel yourself responsible, you exaggerate it, I am afraid,” she said.\\n“Her position in the world is difficult, I can well understand.”\\n\\n“In the world it is hell!” he brought out quickly, frowning darkly.\\n“You can’t imagine moral sufferings greater than what she went through\\nin Petersburg in that fortnight ... and I beg you to believe it.”\\n\\n“Yes, but here, so long as neither Anna ... nor you miss society....”\\n\\n“Society!” he said contemptuously, “how could I miss society?”\\n\\n“So far—and it may be so always—you are happy and at peace. I see in\\nAnna that she is happy, perfectly happy, she has had time to tell me so\\nmuch already,” said Darya Alexandrovna, smiling; and involuntarily, as\\nshe said this, at the same moment a doubt entered her mind whether Anna\\nreally were happy.\\n\\nBut Vronsky, it appeared, had no doubts on that score.\\n\\n“Yes, yes,” he said, “I know that she has revived after all her\\nsufferings; she is happy. She is happy in the present. But I?... I am\\nafraid of what is before us ... I beg your pardon, you would like to\\nwalk on?”\\n\\n“No, I don’t mind.”\\n\\n“Well, then, let us sit here.”\\n\\nDarya Alexandrovna sat down on a garden seat in a corner of the avenue.\\nHe stood up facing her.\\n\\n“I see that she is happy,” he repeated, and the doubt whether she were\\nhappy sank more deeply into Darya Alexandrovna’s mind. “But can it\\nlast? Whether we have acted rightly or wrongly is another question, but\\nthe die is cast,” he said, passing from Russian to French, “and we are\\nbound together for life. We are united by all the ties of love that we\\nhold most sacred. We have a child, we may have other children. But the\\nlaw and all the conditions of our position are such that thousands of\\ncomplications arise which she does not see and does not want to see.\\nAnd that one can well understand. But I can’t help seeing them. My\\ndaughter is by law not my daughter, but Karenin’s. I cannot bear this\\nfalsity!” he said, with a vigorous gesture of refusal, and he looked\\nwith gloomy inquiry towards Darya Alexandrovna.\\n\\nShe made no answer, but simply gazed at him. He went on:\\n\\n“One day a son may be born, my son, and he will be legally a Karenin;\\nhe will not be the heir of my name nor of my property, and however\\nhappy we may be in our home life and however many children we may have,\\nthere will be no real tie between us. They will be Karenins. You can\\nunderstand the bitterness and horror of this position! I have tried to\\nspeak of this to Anna. It irritates her. She does not understand, and\\nto her I cannot speak plainly of all this. Now look at another side. I\\nam happy, happy in her love, but I must have occupation. I have found\\noccupation, and am proud of what I am doing and consider it nobler than\\nthe pursuits of my former companions at court and in the army. And most\\ncertainly I would not change the work I am doing for theirs. I am\\nworking here, settled in my own place, and I am happy and contented,\\nand we need nothing more to make us happy. I love my work here. _Ce\\nn’est pas un pis-aller,_ on the contrary....”\\n\\nDarya Alexandrovna noticed that at this point in his explanation he\\ngrew confused, and she did not quite understand this digression, but\\nshe felt that having once begun to speak of matters near his heart, of\\nwhich he could not speak to Anna, he was now making a clean breast of\\neverything, and that the question of his pursuits in the country fell\\ninto the same category of matters near his heart, as the question of\\nhis relations with Anna.\\n\\n“Well, I will go on,” he said, collecting himself. “The great thing is\\nthat as I work I want to have a conviction that what I am doing will\\nnot die with me, that I shall have heirs to come after me,—and this I\\nhave not. Conceive the position of a man who knows that his children,\\nthe children of the woman he loves, will not be his, but will belong to\\nsomeone who hates them and cares nothing about them! It is awful!”\\n\\nHe paused, evidently much moved.\\n\\n“Yes, indeed, I see that. But what can Anna do?” queried Darya\\nAlexandrovna.\\n\\n“Yes, that brings me to the object of my conversation,” he said,\\ncalming himself with an effort. “Anna can, it depends on her.... Even\\nto petition the Tsar for legitimization, a divorce is essential. And\\nthat depends on Anna. Her husband agreed to a divorce—at that time your\\nhusband had arranged it completely. And now, I know, he would not\\nrefuse it. It is only a matter of writing to him. He said plainly at\\nthat time that if she expressed the desire, he would not refuse. Of\\ncourse,” he said gloomily, “it is one of those Pharisaical cruelties of\\nwhich only such heartless men are capable. He knows what agony any\\nrecollection of him must give her, and knowing her, he must have a\\nletter from her. I can understand that it is agony to her. But the\\nmatter is of such importance, that one must _passer par-dessus toutes\\nces finesses de sentiment. Il y va du bonheur et de l’existence d’Anne\\net de ses enfants._ I won’t speak of myself, though it’s hard for me,\\nvery hard,” he said, with an expression as though he were threatening\\nsomeone for its being hard for him. “And so it is, princess, that I am\\nshamelessly clutching at you as an anchor of salvation. Help me to\\npersuade her to write to him and ask for a divorce.”\\n\\n“Yes, of course,” Darya Alexandrovna said dreamily, as she vividly\\nrecalled her last interview with Alexey Alexandrovitch. “Yes, of\\ncourse,” she repeated with decision, thinking of Anna.\\n\\n“Use your influence with her, make her write. I don’t like—I’m almost\\nunable to speak about this to her.”\\n\\n“Very well, I will talk to her. But how is it she does not think of it\\nherself?” said Darya Alexandrovna, and for some reason she suddenly at\\nthat point recalled Anna’s strange new habit of half-closing her eyes.\\nAnd she remembered that Anna drooped her eyelids just when the deeper\\nquestions of life were touched upon. “Just as though she half-shut her\\neyes to her own life, so as not to see everything,” thought Dolly.\\n“Yes, indeed, for my own sake and for hers I will talk to her,” Dolly\\nsaid in reply to his look of gratitude.\\n\\nThey got up and walked to the house 22\\n\\nWhen Anna found Dolly at home before her, she looked intently in her\\neyes, as though questioning her about the talk she had had with\\nVronsky, but she made no inquiry in words.\\n\\n“I believe it’s dinner time,” she said. “We’ve not seen each other at\\nall yet. I am reckoning on the evening. Now I want to go and dress. I\\nexpect you do too; we all got splashed at the buildings.”\\n\\nDolly went to her room and she felt amused. To change her dress was\\nimpossible, for she had already put on her best dress. But in order to\\nsignify in some way her preparation for dinner, she asked the maid to\\nbrush her dress, changed her cuffs and tie, and put some lace on her\\nhead.\\n\\n“This is all I can do,” she said with a smile to Anna, who came in to\\nher in a third dress, again of extreme simplicity.\\n\\n“Yes, we are too formal here,” she said, as it were apologizing for her\\nmagnificence. “Alexey is delighted at your visit, as he rarely is at\\nanything. He has completely lost his heart to you,” she added. “You’re\\nnot tired?”\\n\\nThere was no time for talking about anything before dinner. Going into\\nthe drawing-room they found Princess Varvara already there, and the\\ngentlemen of the party in black frock-coats. The architect wore a\\nswallow-tail coat. Vronsky presented the doctor and the steward to his\\nguest. The architect he had already introduced to her at the hospital.\\n\\nA stout butler, resplendent with a smoothly shaven round chin and a\\nstarched white cravat, announced that dinner was ready, and the ladies\\ngot up. Vronsky asked Sviazhsky to take in Anna Arkadyevna, and himself\\noffered his arm to Dolly. Veslovsky was before Tushkevitch in offering\\nhis arm to Princess Varvara, so that Tushkevitch with the steward and\\nthe doctor walked in alone.\\n\\nThe dinner, the dining-room, the service, the waiting at table, the\\nwine, and the food, were not simply in keeping with the general tone of\\nmodern luxury throughout all the house, but seemed even more sumptuous\\nand modern. Darya Alexandrovna watched this luxury which was novel to\\nher, and as a good housekeeper used to managing a household—although\\nshe never dreamed of adapting anything she saw to her own household, as\\nit was all in a style of luxury far above her own manner of living—she\\ncould not help scrutinizing every detail, and wondering how and by whom\\nit was all done. Vassenka Veslovsky, her husband, and even Sviazhsky,\\nand many other people she knew, would never have considered this\\nquestion, and would have readily believed what every well-bred host\\ntries to make his guests feel, that is, that all that is well-ordered\\nin his house has cost him, the host, no trouble whatever, but comes of\\nitself. Darya Alexandrovna was well aware that even porridge for the\\nchildren’s breakfast does not come of itself, and that therefore, where\\nso complicated and magnificent a style of luxury was maintained,\\nsomeone must give earnest attention to its organization. And from the\\nglance with which Alexey Kirillovitch scanned the table, from the way\\nhe nodded to the butler, and offered Darya Alexandrovna her choice\\nbetween cold soup and hot soup, she saw that it was all organized and\\nmaintained by the care of the master of the house himself. It was\\nevident that it all rested no more upon Anna than upon Veslovsky. She,\\nSviazhsky, the princess, and Veslovsky, were equally guests, with light\\nhearts enjoying what had been arranged for them.\\n\\nAnna was the hostess only in conducting the conversation. The\\nconversation was a difficult one for the lady of the house at a small\\ntable with persons present, like the steward and the architect,\\nbelonging to a completely different world, struggling not to be\\noverawed by an elegance to which they were unaccustomed, and unable to\\nsustain a large share in the general conversation. But this difficult\\nconversation Anna directed with her usual tact and naturalness, and\\nindeed she did so with actual enjoyment, as Darya Alexandrovna\\nobserved. The conversation began about the row Tushkevitch and\\nVeslovsky had taken alone together in the boat, and Tushkevitch began\\ndescribing the last boat races in Petersburg at the Yacht Club. But\\nAnna, seizing the first pause, at once turned to the architect to draw\\nhim out of his silence.\\n\\n“Nikolay Ivanitch was struck,” she said, meaning Sviazhsky, “at the\\nprogress the new building had made since he was here last; but I am\\nthere every day, and every day I wonder at the rate at which it grows.”\\n\\n“It’s first-rate working with his excellency,” said the architect with\\na smile (he was respectful and composed, though with a sense of his own\\ndignity). “It’s a very different matter to have to do with the district\\nauthorities. Where one would have to write out sheaves of papers, here\\nI call upon the count, and in three words we settle the business.”\\n\\n“The American way of doing business,” said Sviazhsky, with a smile.\\n\\n“Yes, there they build in a rational fashion....”\\n\\nThe conversation passed to the misuse of political power in the United\\nStates, but Anna quickly brought it round to another topic, so as to\\ndraw the steward into talk.\\n\\n“Have you ever seen a reaping machine?” she said, addressing Darya\\nAlexandrovna. “We had just ridden over to look at one when we met. It’s\\nthe first time I ever saw one.”\\n\\n“How do they work?” asked Dolly.\\n\\n“Exactly like little scissors. A plank and a lot of little scissors.\\nLike this.”\\n\\nAnna took a knife and fork in her beautiful white hands covered with\\nrings, and began showing how the machine worked. It was clear that she\\nsaw nothing would be understood from her explanation; but aware that\\nher talk was pleasant and her hands beautiful she went on explaining.\\n\\n“More like little penknives,” Veslovsky said playfully, never taking\\nhis eyes off her.\\n\\nAnna gave a just perceptible smile, but made no answer. “Isn’t it true,\\nKarl Fedoritch, that it’s just like little scissors?” she said to the\\nsteward.\\n\\n“_Oh, ja,_” answered the German. _“Es ist ein ganz einfaches Ding,”_\\nand he began to explain the construction of the machine.\\n\\n“It’s a pity it doesn’t bind too. I saw one at the Vienna exhibition,\\nwhich binds with a wire,” said Sviazhsky. “They would be more\\nprofitable in use.”\\n\\n_“Es kommt drauf an.... Der Preis vom Draht muss ausgerechnet werden.”_\\nAnd the German, roused from his taciturnity, turned to Vronsky. _“Das\\nlässt sich ausrechnen, Erlaucht.”_ The German was just feeling in the\\npocket where were his pencil and the notebook he always wrote in, but\\nrecollecting that he was at a dinner, and observing Vronsky’s chilly\\nglance, he checked himself. _“Zu compliziert, macht zu viel Klopot,”_\\nhe concluded.\\n\\n_“Wünscht man Dochots, so hat man auch Klopots,”_ said Vassenka\\nVeslovsky, mimicking the German. _“J’adore l’allemand,”_ he addressed\\nAnna again with the same smile.\\n\\n_“Cessez,”_ she said with playful severity.\\n\\n“We expected to find you in the fields, Vassily Semyonitch,” she said\\nto the doctor, a sickly-looking man; “have you been there?”\\n\\n“I went there, but I had taken flight,” the doctor answered with gloomy\\njocoseness.\\n\\n“Then you’ve taken a good constitutional?”\\n\\n“Splendid!”\\n\\n“Well, and how was the old woman? I hope it’s not typhus?”\\n\\n“Typhus it is not, but it’s taking a bad turn.”\\n\\n“What a pity!” said Anna, and having thus paid the dues of civility to\\nher domestic circle, she turned to her own friends.\\n\\n“It would be a hard task, though, to construct a machine from your\\ndescription, Anna Arkadyevna,” Sviazhsky said jestingly.\\n\\n“Oh, no, why so?” said Anna with a smile that betrayed that she knew\\nthere was something charming in her disquisitions upon the machine that\\nhad been noticed by Sviazhsky. This new trait of girlish coquettishness\\nmade an unpleasant impression on Dolly.\\n\\n“But Anna Arkadyevna’s knowledge of architecture is marvelous,” said\\nTushkevitch.\\n\\n“To be sure, I heard Anna Arkadyevna talking yesterday about plinths\\nand damp-courses,” said Veslovsky. “Have I got it right?”\\n\\n“There’s nothing marvelous about it, when one sees and hears so much of\\nit,” said Anna. “But, I dare say, you don’t even know what houses are\\nmade of?”\\n\\nDarya Alexandrovna saw that Anna disliked the tone of raillery that\\nexisted between her and Veslovsky, but fell in with it against her\\nwill.\\n\\nVronsky acted in this matter quite differently from Levin. He obviously\\nattached no significance to Veslovsky’s chattering; on the contrary, he\\nencouraged his jests.\\n\\n“Come now, tell us, Veslovsky, how are the stones held together?”\\n\\n“By cement, of course.”\\n\\n“Bravo! And what is cement?”\\n\\n“Oh, some sort of paste ... no, putty,” said Veslovsky, raising a\\ngeneral laugh.\\n\\nThe company at dinner, with the exception of the doctor, the architect,\\nand the steward, who remained plunged in gloomy silence, kept up a\\nconversation that never paused, glancing off one subject, fastening on\\nanother, and at times stinging one or the other to the quick. Once\\nDarya Alexandrovna felt wounded to the quick, and got so hot that she\\npositively flushed and wondered afterwards whether she had said\\nanything extreme or unpleasant. Sviazhsky began talking of Levin,\\ndescribing his strange view that machinery is simply pernicious in its\\neffects on Russian agriculture.\\n\\n“I have not the pleasure of knowing this M. Levin,” Vronsky said,\\nsmiling, “but most likely he has never seen the machines he condemns;\\nor if he has seen and tried any, it must have been after a queer\\nfashion, some Russian imitation, not a machine from abroad. What sort\\nof views can anyone have on such a subject?”\\n\\n“Turkish views, in general,” Veslovsky said, turning to Anna with a\\nsmile.\\n\\n“I can’t defend his opinions,” Darya Alexandrovna said, firing up; “but\\nI can say that he’s a highly cultivated man, and if he were here he\\nwould know very well how to answer you, though I am not capable of\\ndoing so.”\\n\\n“I like him extremely, and we are great friends,” Sviazhsky said,\\nsmiling good-naturedly. “_Mais pardon, il est un petit peu toqué;_ he\\nmaintains, for instance, that district councils and arbitration boards\\nare all of no use, and he is unwilling to take part in anything.”\\n\\n“It’s our Russian apathy,” said Vronsky, pouring water from an iced\\ndecanter into a delicate glass on a high stem; “we’ve no sense of the\\nduties our privileges impose upon us, and so we refuse to recognize\\nthese duties.”\\n\\n“I know no man more strict in the performance of his duties,” said\\nDarya Alexandrovna, irritated by Vronsky’s tone of superiority.\\n\\n“For my part,” pursued Vronsky, who was evidently for some reason or\\nother keenly affected by this conversation, “such as I am, I am, on the\\ncontrary, extremely grateful for the honor they have done me, thanks to\\nNikolay Ivanitch” (he indicated Sviazhsky), “in electing me a justice\\nof the peace. I consider that for me the duty of being present at the\\nsession, of judging some peasants’ quarrel about a horse, is as\\nimportant as anything I can do. And I shall regard it as an honor if\\nthey elect me for the district council. It’s only in that way I can pay\\nfor the advantages I enjoy as a landowner. Unluckily they don’t\\nunderstand the weight that the big landowners ought to have in the\\nstate.”\\n\\nIt was strange to Darya Alexandrovna to hear how serenely confident he\\nwas of being right at his own table. She thought how Levin, who\\nbelieved the opposite, was just as positive in his opinions at his own\\ntable. But she loved Levin, and so she was on his side.\\n\\n“So we can reckon upon you, count, for the coming elections?” said\\nSviazhsky. “But you must come a little beforehand, so as to be on the\\nspot by the eighth. If you would do me the honor to stop with me.”\\n\\n“I rather agree with your _beau-frère_,” said Anna, “though not quite\\non the same ground as he,” she added with a smile. “I’m afraid that we\\nhave too many of these public duties in these latter days. Just as in\\nold days there were so many government functionaries that one had to\\ncall in a functionary for every single thing, so now everyone’s doing\\nsome sort of public duty. Alexey has been here now six months, and he’s\\na member, I do believe, of five or six different public bodies. _Du\\ntrain que cela va,_ the whole time will be wasted on it. And I’m afraid\\nthat with such a multiplicity of these bodies, they’ll end in being a\\nmere form. How many are you a member of, Nikolay Ivanitch?” she turned\\nto Sviazhsky—“over twenty, I fancy.”\\n\\nAnna spoke lightly, but irritation could be discerned in her tone.\\nDarya Alexandrovna, watching Anna and Vronsky attentively, detected it\\ninstantly. She noticed, too, that as she spoke Vronsky’s face had\\nimmediately taken a serious and obstinate expression. Noticing this,\\nand that Princess Varvara at once made haste to change the conversation\\nby talking of Petersburg acquaintances, and remembering what Vronsky\\nhad without apparent connection said in the garden of his work in the\\ncountry, Dolly surmised that this question of public activity was\\nconnected with some deep private disagreement between Anna and Vronsky.\\n\\nThe dinner, the wine, the decoration of the table were all very good;\\nbut it was all like what Darya Alexandrovna had seen at formal dinners\\nand balls which of late years had become quite unfamiliar to her; it\\nall had the same impersonal and constrained character, and so on an\\nordinary day and in a little circle of friends it made a disagreeable\\nimpression on her.\\n\\nAfter dinner they sat on the terrace, then they proceeded to play lawn\\ntennis. The players, divided into two parties, stood on opposite sides\\nof a tightly drawn net with gilt poles on the carefully leveled and\\nrolled croquet-ground. Darya Alexandrovna made an attempt to play, but\\nit was a long time before she could understand the game, and by the\\ntime she did understand it, she was so tired that she sat down with\\nPrincess Varvara and simply looked on at the players. Her partner,\\nTushkevitch, gave up playing too, but the others kept the game up for a\\nlong time. Sviazhsky and Vronsky both played very well and seriously.\\nThey kept a sharp lookout on the balls served to them, and without\\nhaste or getting in each other’s way, they ran adroitly up to them,\\nwaited for the rebound, and neatly and accurately returned them over\\nthe net. Veslovsky played worse than the others. He was too eager, but\\nhe kept the players lively with his high spirits. His laughter and\\noutcries never paused. Like the other men of the party, with the\\nladies’ permission, he took off his coat, and his solid, comely figure\\nin his white shirt-sleeves, with his red perspiring face and his\\nimpulsive movements, made a picture that imprinted itself vividly on\\nthe memory.\\n\\nWhen Darya Alexandrovna lay in bed that night, as soon as she closed\\nher eyes, she saw Vassenka Veslovsky flying about the croquet ground.\\n\\nDuring the game Darya Alexandrovna was not enjoying herself. She did\\nnot like the light tone of raillery that was kept up all the time\\nbetween Vassenka Veslovsky and Anna, and the unnaturalness altogether\\nof grown-up people, all alone without children, playing at a child’s\\ngame. But to avoid breaking up the party and to get through the time\\nsomehow, after a rest she joined the game again, and pretended to be\\nenjoying it. All that day it seemed to her as though she were acting in\\na theater with actors cleverer than she, and that her bad acting was\\nspoiling the whole performance. She had come with the intention of\\nstaying two days, if all went well. But in the evening, during the\\ngame, she made up her mind that she would go home next day. The\\nmaternal cares and worries, which she had so hated on the way, now,\\nafter a day spent without them, struck her in quite another light, and\\ntempted her back to them.\\n\\nWhen, after evening tea and a row by night in the boat, Darya\\nAlexandrovna went alone to her room, took off her dress, and began\\narranging her thin hair for the night, she had a great sense of relief.\\n\\nIt was positively disagreeable to her to think that Anna was coming to\\nsee her immediately. She longed to be alone with her own thoughts 23\\n\\nDolly was wanting to go to bed when Anna came in to see her, attired\\nfor the night. In the course of the day Anna had several times begun to\\nspeak of matters near her heart, and every time after a few words she\\nhad stopped: “Afterwards, by ourselves, we’ll talk about everything.\\nI’ve got so much I want to tell you,” she said.\\n\\nNow they were by themselves, and Anna did not know what to talk about.\\nShe sat in the window looking at Dolly, and going over in her own mind\\nall the stores of intimate talk which had seemed so inexhaustible\\nbeforehand, and she found nothing. At that moment it seemed to her that\\neverything had been said already.\\n\\n“Well, what of Kitty?” she said with a heavy sigh, looking penitently\\nat Dolly. “Tell me the truth, Dolly: isn’t she angry with me?”\\n\\n“Angry? Oh, no!” said Darya Alexandrovna, smiling.\\n\\n“But she hates me, despises me?”\\n\\n“Oh, no! But you know that sort of thing isn’t forgiven.”\\n\\n“Yes, yes,” said Anna, turning away and looking out of the open window.\\n“But I was not to blame. And who is to blame? What’s the meaning of\\nbeing to blame? Could it have been otherwise? What do you think? Could\\nit possibly have happened that you didn’t become the wife of Stiva?”\\n\\n“Really, I don’t know. But this is what I want you to tell me....”\\n\\n“Yes, yes, but we’ve not finished about Kitty. Is she happy? He’s a\\nvery nice man, they say.”\\n\\n“He’s much more than very nice. I don’t know a better man.”\\n\\n“Ah, how glad I am! I’m so glad! Much more than very nice,” she\\nrepeated.\\n\\nDolly smiled.\\n\\n“But tell me about yourself. We’ve a great deal to talk about. And I’ve\\nhad a talk with....” Dolly did not know what to call him. She felt it\\nawkward to call him either the count or Alexey Kirillovitch.\\n\\n“With Alexey,” said Anna, “I know what you talked about. But I wanted\\nto ask you directly what you think of me, of my life?”\\n\\n“How am I to say like that straight off? I really don’t know.”\\n\\n“No, tell me all the same.... You see my life. But you mustn’t forget\\nthat you’re seeing us in the summer, when you have come to us and we\\nare not alone.... But we came here early in the spring, lived quite\\nalone, and shall be alone again, and I desire nothing better. But\\nimagine me living alone without him, alone, and that will be ... I see\\nby everything that it will often be repeated, that he will be half the\\ntime away from home,” she said, getting up and sitting down close by\\nDolly.\\n\\n“Of course,” she interrupted Dolly, who would have answered, “of course\\nI won’t try to keep him by force. I don’t keep him indeed. The races\\nare just coming, his horses are running, he will go. I’m very glad. But\\nthink of me, fancy my position.... But what’s the use of talking about\\nit?” She smiled. “Well, what did he talk about with you?”\\n\\n“He spoke of what I want to speak about of myself, and it’s easy for me\\nto be his advocate; of whether there is not a possibility ... whether\\nyou could not....” (Darya Alexandrovna hesitated) “correct, improve\\nyour position.... You know how I look at it.... But all the same, if\\npossible, you should get married....”\\n\\n“Divorce, you mean?” said Anna. “Do you know, the only woman who came\\nto see me in Petersburg was Betsy Tverskaya? You know her, of course?\\n_Au fond, c’est la femme la plus depravée qui existe._ She had an\\nintrigue with Tushkevitch, deceiving her husband in the basest way. And\\nshe told me that she did not care to know me so long as my position was\\nirregular. Don’t imagine I would compare ... I know you, darling. But I\\ncould not help remembering.... Well, so what did he say to you?” she\\nrepeated.\\n\\n“He said that he was unhappy on your account and his own. Perhaps you\\nwill say that it’s egoism, but what a legitimate and noble egoism. He\\nwants first of all to legitimize his daughter, and to be your husband,\\nto have a legal right to you.”\\n\\n“What wife, what slave can be so utterly a slave as I, in my position?”\\nshe put in gloomily.\\n\\n“The chief thing he desires ... he desires that you should not suffer.”\\n\\n“That’s impossible. Well?”\\n\\n“Well, and the most legitimate desire—he wishes that your children\\nshould have a name.”\\n\\n“What children?” Anna said, not looking at Dolly, and half closing her\\neyes.\\n\\n“Annie and those to come....”\\n\\n“He need not trouble on that score; I shall have no more children.”\\n\\n“How can you tell that you won’t?”\\n\\n“I shall not, because I don’t wish it.” And, in spite of all her\\nemotion, Anna smiled, as she caught the naïve expression of curiosity,\\nwonder, and horror on Dolly’s face.\\n\\n“The doctor told me after my illness....”\\n\\n“Impossible!” said Dolly, opening her eyes wide.\\n\\nFor her this was one of those discoveries the consequences and\\ndeductions from which are so immense that all that one feels for the\\nfirst instant is that it is impossible to take it all in, and that one\\nwill have to reflect a great, great deal upon it.\\n\\nThis discovery, suddenly throwing light on all those families of one or\\ntwo children, which had hitherto been so incomprehensible to her,\\naroused so many ideas, reflections, and contradictory emotions, that\\nshe had nothing to say, and simply gazed with wide-open eyes of wonder\\nat Anna. This was the very thing she had been dreaming of, but now\\nlearning that it was possible, she was horrified. She felt that it was\\ntoo simple a solution of too complicated a problem.\\n\\n_“N’est-ce pas immoral?”_ was all she said, after a brief pause.\\n\\n“Why so? Think, I have a choice between two alternatives: either to be\\nwith child, that is an invalid, or to be the friend and companion of my\\nhusband—practically my husband,” Anna said in a tone intentionally\\nsuperficial and frivolous.\\n\\n“Yes, yes,” said Darya Alexandrovna, hearing the very arguments she had\\nused to herself, and not finding the same force in them as before.\\n\\n“For you, for other people,” said Anna, as though divining her\\nthoughts, “there may be reason to hesitate; but for me.... You must\\nconsider, I am not his wife; he loves me as long as he loves me. And\\nhow am I to keep his love? Not like this!”\\n\\nShe moved her white hands in a curve before her waist with\\nextraordinary rapidity, as happens during moments of excitement; ideas\\nand memories rushed into Darya Alexandrovna’s head. “I,” she thought,\\n“did not keep my attraction for Stiva; he left me for others, and the\\nfirst woman for whom he betrayed me did not keep him by being always\\npretty and lively. He deserted her and took another. And can Anna\\nattract and keep Count Vronsky in that way? If that is what he looks\\nfor, he will find dresses and manners still more attractive and\\ncharming. And however white and beautiful her bare arms are, however\\nbeautiful her full figure and her eager face under her black curls, he\\nwill find something better still, just as my disgusting, pitiful, and\\ncharming husband does.”\\n\\nDolly made no answer, she merely sighed. Anna noticed this sigh,\\nindicating dissent, and she went on. In her armory she had other\\narguments so strong that no answer could be made to them.\\n\\n“Do you say that it’s not right? But you must consider,” she went on;\\n“you forget my position. How can I desire children? I’m not speaking of\\nthe suffering, I’m not afraid of that. Think only, what are my children\\nto be? Ill-fated children, who will have to bear a stranger’s name. For\\nthe very fact of their birth they will be forced to be ashamed of their\\nmother, their father, their birth.”\\n\\n“But that is just why a divorce is necessary.” But Anna did not hear\\nher. She longed to give utterance to all the arguments with which she\\nhad so many times convinced herself.\\n\\n“What is reason given me for, if I am not to use it to avoid bringing\\nunhappy beings into the world!” She looked at Dolly, but without\\nwaiting for a reply she went on:\\n\\n“I should always feel I had wronged these unhappy children,” she said.\\n“If they are not, at any rate they are not unhappy; while if they are\\nunhappy, I alone should be to blame for it.”\\n\\nThese were the very arguments Darya Alexandrovna had used in her own\\nreflections; but she heard them without understanding them. “How can\\none wrong creatures that don’t exist?” she thought. And all at once the\\nidea struck her: could it possibly, under any circumstances, have been\\nbetter for her favorite Grisha if he had never existed? And this seemed\\nto her so wild, so strange, that she shook her head to drive away this\\ntangle of whirling, mad ideas.\\n\\n“No, I don’t know; it’s not right,” was all she said, with an\\nexpression of disgust on her face.\\n\\n“Yes, but you mustn’t forget that you and I.... And besides that,”\\nadded Anna, in spite of the wealth of her arguments and the poverty of\\nDolly’s objections, seeming still to admit that it was not right,\\n“don’t forget the chief point, that I am not now in the same position\\nas you. For you the question is: do you desire not to have any more\\nchildren; while for me it is: do I desire to have them? And that’s a\\ngreat difference. You must see that I can’t desire it in my position.”\\n\\nDarya Alexandrovna made no reply. She suddenly felt that she had got\\nfar away from Anna; that there lay between them a barrier of questions\\non which they could never agree, and about which it was better not to\\nspeak 24\\n\\n“Then there is all the more reason for you to legalize your position,\\nif possible,” said Dolly.\\n\\n“Yes, if possible,” said Anna, speaking all at once in an utterly\\ndifferent tone, subdued and mournful.\\n\\n“Surely you don’t mean a divorce is impossible? I was told your husband\\nhad consented to it.”\\n\\n“Dolly, I don’t want to talk about that.”\\n\\n“Oh, we won’t then,” Darya Alexandrovna hastened to say, noticing the\\nexpression of suffering on Anna’s face. “All I see is that you take too\\ngloomy a view of things.”\\n\\n“I? Not at all! I’m always bright and happy. You see, _je fais des\\npassions._ Veslovsky....”\\n\\n“Yes, to tell the truth, I don’t like Veslovsky’s tone,” said Darya\\nAlexandrovna, anxious to change the subject.\\n\\n“Oh, that’s nonsense! It amuses Alexey, and that’s all; but he’s a boy,\\nand quite under my control. You know, I turn him as I please. It’s just\\nas it might be with your Grisha.... Dolly!”—she suddenly changed the\\nsubject—“you say I take too gloomy a view of things. You can’t\\nunderstand. It’s too awful! I try not to take any view of it at all.”\\n\\n“But I think you ought to. You ought to do all you can.”\\n\\n“But what can I do? Nothing. You tell me to marry Alexey, and say I\\ndon’t think about it. I don’t think about it!” she repeated, and a\\nflush rose into her face. She got up, straightening her chest, and\\nsighed heavily. With her light step she began pacing up and down the\\nroom, stopping now and then. “I don’t think of it? Not a day, not an\\nhour passes that I don’t think of it, and blame myself for thinking of\\nit ... because thinking of that may drive me mad. Drive me mad!” she\\nrepeated. “When I think of it, I can’t sleep without morphine. But\\nnever mind. Let us talk quietly. They tell me, divorce. In the first\\nplace, he won’t give me a divorce. He’s under the influence of Countess\\nLidia Ivanovna now.”\\n\\nDarya Alexandrovna, sitting erect on a chair, turned her head,\\nfollowing Anna with a face of sympathetic suffering.\\n\\n“You ought to make the attempt,” she said softly.\\n\\n“Suppose I make the attempt. What does it mean?” she said, evidently\\ngiving utterance to a thought, a thousand times thought over and\\nlearned by heart. “It means that I, hating him, but still recognizing\\nthat I have wronged him—and I consider him magnanimous—that I humiliate\\nmyself to write to him.... Well, suppose I make the effort; I do it.\\nEither I receive a humiliating refusal or consent.... Well, I have\\nreceived his consent, say....” Anna was at that moment at the furthest\\nend of the room, and she stopped there, doing something to the curtain\\nat the window. “I receive his consent, but my ... my son? They won’t\\ngive him up to me. He will grow up despising me, with his father, whom\\nI’ve abandoned. Do you see, I love ... equally, I think, but both more\\nthan myself—two creatures, Seryozha and Alexey.”\\n\\nShe came out into the middle of the room and stood facing Dolly, with\\nher arms pressed tightly across her chest. In her white dressing gown\\nher figure seemed more than usually grand and broad. She bent her head,\\nand with shining, wet eyes looked from under her brows at Dolly, a thin\\nlittle pitiful figure in her patched dressing jacket and nightcap,\\nshaking all over with emotion.\\n\\n“It is only those two creatures that I love, and one excludes the\\nother. I can’t have them together, and that’s the only thing I want.\\nAnd since I can’t have that, I don’t care about the rest. I don’t care\\nabout anything, anything. And it will end one way or another, and so I\\ncan’t, I don’t like to talk of it. So don’t blame me, don’t judge me\\nfor anything. You can’t with your pure heart understand all that I’m\\nsuffering.” She went up, sat down beside Dolly, and with a guilty look,\\npeeped into her face and took her hand.\\n\\n“What are you thinking? What are you thinking about me? Don’t despise\\nme. I don’t deserve contempt. I’m simply unhappy. If anyone is unhappy,\\nI am,” she articulated, and turning away, she burst into tears.\\n\\nLeft alone, Darya Alexandrovna said her prayers and went to bed. She\\nhad felt for Anna with all her heart while she was speaking to her, but\\nnow she could not force herself to think of her. The memories of home\\nand of her children rose up in her imagination with a peculiar charm\\nquite new to her, with a sort of new brilliance. That world of her own\\nseemed to her now so sweet and precious that she would not on any\\naccount spend an extra day outside it, and she made up her mind that\\nshe would certainly go back next day.\\n\\nAnna meantime went back to her boudoir, took a wine-glass and dropped\\ninto it several drops of a medicine, of which the principal ingredient\\nwas morphine. After drinking it off and sitting still a little while,\\nshe went into her bedroom in a soothed and more cheerful frame of mind.\\n\\nWhen she went into the bedroom, Vronsky looked intently at her. He was\\nlooking for traces of the conversation which he knew that, staying so\\nlong in Dolly’s room, she must have had with her. But in her expression\\nof restrained excitement, and of a sort of reserve, he could find\\nnothing but the beauty that always bewitched him afresh though he was\\nused to it, the consciousness of it, and the desire that it should\\naffect him. He did not want to ask her what they had been talking of,\\nbut he hoped that she would tell him something of her own accord. But\\nshe only said:\\n\\n“I am so glad you like Dolly. You do, don’t you?”\\n\\n“Oh, I’ve known her a long while, you know. She’s very good-hearted, I\\nsuppose, _mais excessivement terre-à-terre._ Still, I’m very glad to\\nsee her.”\\n\\nHe took Anna’s hand and looked inquiringly into her eyes.\\n\\nMisinterpreting the look, she smiled to him. Next morning, in spite of\\nthe protests of her hosts, Darya Alexandrovna prepared for her homeward\\njourney. Levin’s coachman, in his by no means new coat and shabby hat,\\nwith his ill-matched horses and his coach with the patched mud-guards,\\ndrove with gloomy determination into the covered gravel approach.\\n\\nDarya Alexandrovna disliked taking leave of Princess Varvara and the\\ngentlemen of the party. After a day spent together, both she and her\\nhosts were distinctly aware that they did not get on together, and that\\nit was better for them not to meet. Only Anna was sad. She knew that\\nnow, from Dolly’s departure, no one again would stir up within her soul\\nthe feelings that had been roused by their conversation. It hurt her to\\nstir up these feelings, but yet she knew that that was the best part of\\nher soul, and that that part of her soul would quickly be smothered in\\nthe life she was leading.\\n\\nAs she drove out into the open country, Darya Alexandrovna had a\\ndelightful sense of relief, and she felt tempted to ask the two men how\\nthey had liked being at Vronsky’s, when suddenly the coachman, Philip,\\nexpressed himself unasked:\\n\\n“Rolling in wealth they may be, but three pots of oats was all they\\ngave us. Everything cleared up till there wasn’t a grain left by\\ncockcrow. What are three pots? A mere mouthful! And oats now down to\\nforty-five kopecks. At our place, no fear, all comers may have as much\\nas they can eat.”\\n\\n“The master’s a screw,” put in the counting-house clerk.\\n\\n“Well, did you like their horses?” asked Dolly.\\n\\n“The horses!—there’s no two opinions about them. And the food was good.\\nBut it seemed to me sort of dreary there, Darya Alexandrovna. I don’t\\nknow what you thought,” he said, turning his handsome, good-natured\\nface to her.\\n\\n“I thought so too. Well, shall we get home by evening?”\\n\\n“Eh, we must!”\\n\\nOn reaching home and finding everyone entirely satisfactory and\\nparticularly charming, Darya Alexandrovna began with great liveliness\\ntelling them how she had arrived, how warmly they had received her, of\\nthe luxury and good taste in which the Vronskys lived, and of their\\nrecreations, and she would not allow a word to be said against them.\\n\\n“One has to know Anna and Vronsky—I have got to know him better now—to\\nsee how nice they are, and how touching,” she said, speaking now with\\nperfect sincerity, and forgetting the vague feeling of dissatisfaction\\nand awkwardness she had experienced there 25\\n\\nVronsky and Anna spent the whole summer and part of the winter in the\\ncountry, living in just the same condition, and still taking no steps\\nto obtain a divorce. It was an understood thing between them that they\\nshould not go away anywhere; but both felt, the longer they lived\\nalone, especially in the autumn, without guests in the house, that they\\ncould not stand this existence, and that they would have to alter it.\\n\\nTheir life was apparently such that nothing better could be desired.\\nThey had the fullest abundance of everything; they had a child, and\\nboth had occupation. Anna devoted just as much care to her appearance\\nwhen they had no visitors, and she did a great deal of reading, both of\\nnovels and of what serious literature was in fashion. She ordered all\\nthe books that were praised in the foreign papers and reviews she\\nreceived, and read them with that concentrated attention which is only\\ngiven to what is read in seclusion. Moreover, every subject that was of\\ninterest to Vronsky, she studied in books and special journals, so that\\nhe often went straight to her with questions relating to agriculture or\\narchitecture, sometimes even with questions relating to horse-breeding\\nor sport. He was amazed at her knowledge, her memory, and at first was\\ndisposed to doubt it, to ask for confirmation of her facts; and she\\nwould find what he asked for in some book, and show it to him.\\n\\nThe building of the hospital, too, interested her. She did not merely\\nassist, but planned and suggested a great deal herself. But her chief\\nthought was still of herself—how far she was dear to Vronsky, how far\\nshe could make up to him for all he had given up. Vronsky appreciated\\nthis desire not only to please, but to serve him, which had become the\\nsole aim of her existence, but at the same time he wearied of the\\nloving snares in which she tried to hold him fast. As time went on, and\\nhe saw himself more and more often held fast in these snares, he had an\\never growing desire, not so much to escape from them, as to try whether\\nthey hindered his freedom. Had it not been for this growing desire to\\nbe free, not to have scenes every time he wanted to go to the town to a\\nmeeting or a race, Vronsky would have been perfectly satisfied with his\\nlife. The rôle he had taken up, the rôle of a wealthy landowner, one of\\nthat class which ought to be the very heart of the Russian aristocracy,\\nwas entirely to his taste; and now, after spending six months in that\\ncharacter, he derived even greater satisfaction from it. And his\\nmanagement of his estate, which occupied and absorbed him more and\\nmore, was most successful. In spite of the immense sums cost him by the\\nhospital, by machinery, by cows ordered from Switzerland, and many\\nother things, he was convinced that he was not wasting, but increasing\\nhis substance. In all matters affecting income, the sales of timber,\\nwheat, and wool, the letting of lands, Vronsky was hard as a rock, and\\nknew well how to keep up prices. In all operations on a large scale on\\nthis and his other estates, he kept to the simplest methods involving\\nno risk, and in trifling details he was careful and exacting to an\\nextreme degree. In spite of all the cunning and ingenuity of the German\\nsteward, who would try to tempt him into purchases by making his\\noriginal estimate always far larger than really required, and then\\nrepresenting to Vronsky that he might get the thing cheaper, and so\\nmake a profit, Vronsky did not give in. He listened to his steward,\\ncross-examined him, and only agreed to his suggestions when the\\nimplement to be ordered or constructed was the very newest, not yet\\nknown in Russia, and likely to excite wonder. Apart from such\\nexceptions, he resolved upon an increased outlay only where there was a\\nsurplus, and in making such an outlay he went into the minutest\\ndetails, and insisted on getting the very best for his money; so that\\nby the method on which he managed his affairs, it was clear that he was\\nnot wasting, but increasing his substance.\\n\\nIn October there were the provincial elections in the Kashinsky\\nprovince, where were the estates of Vronsky, Sviazhsky, Koznishev,\\nOblonsky, and a small part of Levin’s land.\\n\\nThese elections were attracting public attention from several\\ncircumstances connected with them, and also from the people taking part\\nin them. There had been a great deal of talk about them, and great\\npreparations were being made for them. Persons who never attended the\\nelections were coming from Moscow, from Petersburg, and from abroad to\\nattend these. Vronsky had long before promised Sviazhsky to go to them.\\nBefore the elections Sviazhsky, who often visited Vozdvizhenskoe, drove\\nover to fetch Vronsky. On the day before there had been almost a\\nquarrel between Vronsky and Anna over this proposed expedition. It was\\nthe very dullest autumn weather, which is so dreary in the country, and\\nso, preparing himself for a struggle, Vronsky, with a hard and cold\\nexpression, informed Anna of his departure as he had never spoken to\\nher before. But, to his surprise, Anna accepted the information with\\ngreat composure, and merely asked when he would be back. He looked\\nintently at her, at a loss to explain this composure. She smiled at his\\nlook. He knew that way she had of withdrawing into herself, and knew\\nthat it only happened when she had determined upon something without\\nletting him know her plans. He was afraid of this; but he was so\\nanxious to avoid a scene that he kept up appearances, and half\\nsincerely believed in what he longed to believe in—her reasonableness.\\n\\n“I hope you won’t be dull?”\\n\\n“I hope not,” said Anna. “I got a box of books yesterday from\\nGautier’s. No, I shan’t be dull.”\\n\\n“She’s trying to take that tone, and so much the better,” he thought,\\n“or else it would be the same thing over and over again.”\\n\\nAnd he set off for the elections without appealing to her for a candid\\nexplanation. It was the first time since the beginning of their\\nintimacy that he had parted from her without a full explanation. From\\none point of view this troubled him, but on the other side he felt that\\nit was better so. “At first there will be, as this time, something\\nundefined kept back, and then she will get used to it. In any case I\\ncan give up anything for her, but not my masculine independence,” he\\nthought 26\\n\\nIn September Levin moved to Moscow for Kitty’s confinement. He had\\nspent a whole month in Moscow with nothing to do, when Sergey\\nIvanovitch, who had property in the Kashinsky province, and took great\\ninterest in the question of the approaching elections, made ready to\\nset off to the elections. He invited his brother, who had a vote in the\\nSeleznevsky district, to come with him. Levin had, moreover, to\\ntransact in Kashin some extremely important business relating to the\\nwardship of land and to the receiving of certain redemption money for\\nhis sister, who was abroad.\\n\\nLevin still hesitated, but Kitty, who saw that he was bored in Moscow,\\nand urged him to go, on her own authority ordered him the proper\\nnobleman’s uniform, costing seven pounds. And that seven pounds paid\\nfor the uniform was the chief cause that finally decided Levin to go.\\nHe went to Kashin....\\n\\nLevin had been six days in Kashin, visiting the assembly each day, and\\nbusily engaged about his sister’s business, which still dragged on. The\\ndistrict marshals of nobility were all occupied with the elections, and\\nit was impossible to get the simplest thing done that depended upon the\\ncourt of wardship. The other matter, the payment of the sums due, was\\nmet too by difficulties. After long negotiations over the legal\\ndetails, the money was at last ready to be paid; but the notary, a most\\nobliging person, could not hand over the order, because it must have\\nthe signature of the president, and the president, though he had not\\ngiven over his duties to a deputy, was at the elections. All these\\nworrying negotiations, this endless going from place to place, and\\ntalking with pleasant and excellent people, who quite saw the\\nunpleasantness of the petitioner’s position, but were powerless to\\nassist him—all these efforts that yielded no result, led to a feeling\\nof misery in Levin akin to the mortifying helplessness one experiences\\nin dreams when one tries to use physical force. He felt this frequently\\nas he talked to his most good-natured solicitor. This solicitor did, it\\nseemed, everything possible, and strained every nerve to get him out of\\nhis difficulties. “I tell you what you might try,” he said more than\\nonce; “go to so-and-so and so-and-so,” and the solicitor drew up a\\nregular plan for getting round the fatal point that hindered\\neverything. But he would add immediately, “It’ll mean some delay,\\nanyway, but you might try it.” And Levin did try, and did go. Everyone\\nwas kind and civil, but the point evaded seemed to crop up again in the\\nend, and again to bar the way. What was particularly trying, was that\\nLevin could not make out with whom he was struggling, to whose interest\\nit was that his business should not be done. That no one seemed to\\nknow; the solicitor certainly did not know. If Levin could have\\nunderstood why, just as he saw why one can only approach the booking\\noffice of a railway station in single file, it would not have been so\\nvexatious and tiresome to him. But with the hindrances that confronted\\nhim in his business, no one could explain why they existed.\\n\\nBut Levin had changed a good deal since his marriage; he was patient,\\nand if he could not see why it was all arranged like this, he told\\nhimself that he could not judge without knowing all about it, and that\\nmost likely it must be so, and he tried not to fret.\\n\\nIn attending the elections, too, and taking part in them, he tried now\\nnot to judge, not to fall foul of them, but to comprehend as fully as\\nhe could the question which was so earnestly and ardently absorbing\\nhonest and excellent men whom he respected. Since his marriage there\\nhad been revealed to Levin so many new and serious aspects of life that\\nhad previously, through his frivolous attitude to them, seemed of no\\nimportance, that in the question of the elections too he assumed and\\ntried to find some serious significance.\\n\\nSergey Ivanovitch explained to him the meaning and object of the\\nproposed revolution at the elections. The marshal of the province in\\nwhose hands the law had placed the control of so many important public\\nfunctions—the guardianship of wards (the very department which was\\ngiving Levin so much trouble just now), the disposal of large sums\\nsubscribed by the nobility of the province, the high schools, female,\\nmale, and military, and popular instruction on the new model, and\\nfinally, the district council—the marshal of the province, Snetkov, was\\na nobleman of the old school,—dissipating an immense fortune, a\\ngood-hearted man, honest after his own fashion, but utterly without any\\ncomprehension of the needs of modern days. He always took, in every\\nquestion, the side of the nobility; he was positively antagonistic to\\nthe spread of popular education, and he succeeded in giving a purely\\nparty character to the district council which ought by rights to be of\\nsuch an immense importance. What was needed was to put in his place a\\nfresh, capable, perfectly modern man, of contemporary ideas, and to\\nframe their policy so as from the rights conferred upon the nobles, not\\nas the nobility, but as an element of the district council, to extract\\nall the powers of self-government that could possibly be derived from\\nthem. In the wealthy Kashinsky province, which always took the lead of\\nother provinces in everything, there was now such a preponderance of\\nforces that this policy, once carried through properly there, might\\nserve as a model for other provinces for all Russia. And hence the\\nwhole question was of the greatest importance. It was proposed to elect\\nas marshal in place of Snetkov either Sviazhsky, or, better still,\\nNevyedovsky, a former university professor, a man of remarkable\\nintelligence and a great friend of Sergey Ivanovitch.\\n\\nThe meeting was opened by the governor, who made a speech to the\\nnobles, urging them to elect the public functionaries, not from regard\\nfor persons, but for the service and welfare of their fatherland, and\\nhoping that the honorable nobility of the Kashinsky province would, as\\nat all former elections, hold their duty as sacred, and vindicate the\\nexalted confidence of the monarch.\\n\\nWhen he had finished with his speech, the governor walked out of the\\nhall, and the noblemen noisily and eagerly—some even\\nenthusiastically—followed him and thronged round him while he put on\\nhis fur coat and conversed amicably with the marshal of the province.\\nLevin, anxious to see into everything and not to miss anything, stood\\nthere too in the crowd, and heard the governor say: “Please tell Marya\\nIvanovna my wife is very sorry she couldn’t come to the Home.” And\\nthereupon the nobles in high good-humor sorted out their fur coats and\\nall drove off to the cathedral.\\n\\nIn the cathedral Levin, lifting his hand like the rest and repeating\\nthe words of the archdeacon, swore with most terrible oaths to do all\\nthe governor had hoped they would do. Church services always affected\\nLevin, and as he uttered the words “I kiss the cross,” and glanced\\nround at the crowd of young and old men repeating the same, he felt\\ntouched.\\n\\nOn the second and third days there was business relating to the\\nfinances of the nobility and the female high school, of no importance\\nwhatever, as Sergey Ivanovitch explained, and Levin, busy seeing after\\nhis own affairs, did not attend the meetings. On the fourth day the\\nauditing of the marshal’s accounts took place at the high table of the\\nmarshal of the province. And then there occurred the first skirmish\\nbetween the new party and the old. The committee who had been deputed\\nto verify the accounts reported to the meeting that all was in order.\\nThe marshal of the province got up, thanked the nobility for their\\nconfidence, and shed tears. The nobles gave him a loud welcome, and\\nshook hands with him. But at that instant a nobleman of Sergey\\nIvanovitch’s party said that he had heard that the committee had not\\nverified the accounts, considering such a verification an insult to the\\nmarshal of the province. One of the members of the committee\\nincautiously admitted this. Then a small gentleman, very young-looking\\nbut very malignant, began to say that it would probably be agreeable to\\nthe marshal of the province to give an account of his expenditures of\\nthe public moneys, and that the misplaced delicacy of the members of\\nthe committee was depriving him of this moral satisfaction. Then the\\nmembers of the committee tried to withdraw their admission, and Sergey\\nIvanovitch began to prove that they must logically admit either that\\nthey had verified the accounts or that they had not, and he developed\\nthis dilemma in detail. Sergey Ivanovitch was answered by the spokesman\\nof the opposite party. Then Sviazhsky spoke, and then the malignant\\ngentleman again. The discussion lasted a long time and ended in\\nnothing. Levin was surprised that they should dispute upon this subject\\nso long, especially as, when he asked Sergey Ivanovitch whether he\\nsupposed that money had been misappropriated, Sergey Ivanovitch\\nanswered:\\n\\n“Oh, no! He’s an honest man. But those old-fashioned methods of\\npaternal family arrangements in the management of provincial affairs\\nmust be broken down.”\\n\\nOn the fifth day came the elections of the district marshals. It was\\nrather a stormy day in several districts. In the Seleznevsky district\\nSviazhsky was elected unanimously without a ballot, and he gave a\\ndinner that evening 27\\n\\nThe sixth day was fixed for the election of the marshal of the\\nprovince.\\n\\nThe rooms, large and small, were full of noblemen in all sorts of\\nuniforms. Many had come only for that day. Men who had not seen each\\nother for years, some from the Crimea, some from Petersburg, some from\\nabroad, met in the rooms of the Hall of Nobility. There was much\\ndiscussion around the governor’s table under the portrait of the Tsar.\\n\\nThe nobles, both in the larger and the smaller rooms, grouped\\nthemselves in camps, and from their hostile and suspicious glances,\\nfrom the silence that fell upon them when outsiders approached a group,\\nand from the way that some, whispering together, retreated to the\\nfarther corridor, it was evident that each side had secrets from the\\nother. In appearance the noblemen were sharply divided into two\\nclasses: the old and the new. The old were for the most part either in\\nold uniforms of the nobility, buttoned up closely, with spurs and hats,\\nor in their own special naval, cavalry, infantry, or official uniforms.\\nThe uniforms of the older men were embroidered in the old-fashioned way\\nwith epaulets on their shoulders; they were unmistakably tight and\\nshort in the waist, as though their wearers had grown out of them. The\\nyounger men wore the uniform of the nobility with long waists and broad\\nshoulders, unbuttoned over white waistcoats, or uniforms with black\\ncollars and with the embroidered badges of justices of the peace. To\\nthe younger men belonged the court uniforms that here and there\\nbrightened up the crowd.\\n\\nBut the division into young and old did not correspond with the\\ndivision of parties. Some of the young men, as Levin observed, belonged\\nto the old party; and some of the very oldest noblemen, on the\\ncontrary, were whispering with Sviazhsky, and were evidently ardent\\npartisans of the new party.\\n\\nLevin stood in the smaller room, where they were smoking and taking\\nlight refreshments, close to his own friends, and listening to what\\nthey were saying, he conscientiously exerted all his intelligence\\ntrying to understand what was said. Sergey Ivanovitch was the center\\nround which the others grouped themselves. He was listening at that\\nmoment to Sviazhsky and Hliustov, the marshal of another district, who\\nbelonged to their party. Hliustov would not agree to go with his\\ndistrict to ask Snetkov to stand, while Sviazhsky was persuading him to\\ndo so, and Sergey Ivanovitch was approving of the plan. Levin could not\\nmake out why the opposition was to ask the marshal to stand whom they\\nwanted to supersede.\\n\\nStepan Arkadyevitch, who had just been drinking and taking some lunch,\\ncame up to them in his uniform of a gentleman of the bedchamber, wiping\\nhis lips with a perfumed handkerchief of bordered batiste.\\n\\n“We are placing our forces,” he said, pulling out his whiskers, “Sergey\\nIvanovitch!”\\n\\nAnd listening to the conversation, he supported Sviazhsky’s contention.\\n\\n“One district’s enough, and Sviazhsky’s obviously of the opposition,”\\nhe said, words evidently intelligible to all except Levin.\\n\\n“Why, Kostya, you here too! I suppose you’re converted, eh?” he added,\\nturning to Levin and drawing his arm through his. Levin would have been\\nglad indeed to be converted, but could not make out what the point was,\\nand retreating a few steps from the speakers, he explained to Stepan\\nArkadyevitch his inability to understand why the marshal of the\\nprovince should be asked to stand.\\n\\n_“O sancta simplicitas!”_ said Stepan Arkadyevitch, and briefly and\\nclearly he explained it to Levin. If, as at previous elections, all the\\ndistricts asked the marshal of the province to stand, then he would be\\nelected without a ballot. That must not be. Now eight districts had\\nagreed to call upon him: if two refused to do so, Snetkov might decline\\nto stand at all; and then the old party might choose another of their\\nparty, which would throw them completely out in their reckoning. But if\\nonly one district, Sviazhsky’s, did not call upon him to stand, Snetkov\\nwould let himself be balloted for. They were even, some of them, going\\nto vote for him, and purposely to let him get a good many votes, so\\nthat the enemy might be thrown off the scent, and when a candidate of\\nthe other side was put up, they too might give him some votes. Levin\\nunderstood to some extent, but not fully, and would have put a few more\\nquestions, when suddenly everyone began talking and making a noise and\\nthey moved towards the big room.\\n\\n“What is it? eh? whom?” “No guarantee? whose? what?” “They won’t pass\\nhim?” “No guarantee?” “They won’t let Flerov in?” “Eh, because of the\\ncharge against him?” “Why, at this rate, they won’t admit anyone. It’s\\na swindle!” “The law!” Levin heard exclamations on all sides, and he\\nmoved into the big room together with the others, all hurrying\\nsomewhere and afraid of missing something. Squeezed by the crowding\\nnoblemen, he drew near the high table where the marshal of the\\nprovince, Sviazhsky, and the other leaders were hotly disputing about\\nsomething 28\\n\\nLevin was standing rather far off. A nobleman breathing heavily and\\nhoarsely at his side, and another whose thick boots were creaking,\\nprevented him from hearing distinctly. He could only hear the soft\\nvoice of the marshal faintly, then the shrill voice of the malignant\\ngentleman, and then the voice of Sviazhsky. They were disputing, as far\\nas he could make out, as to the interpretation to be put on the act and\\nthe exact meaning of the words: “liable to be called up for trial.”\\n\\nThe crowd parted to make way for Sergey Ivanovitch approaching the\\ntable. Sergey Ivanovitch, waiting till the malignant gentleman had\\nfinished speaking, said that he thought the best solution would be to\\nrefer to the act itself, and asked the secretary to find the act. The\\nact said that in case of difference of opinion, there must be a ballot.\\n\\nSergey Ivanovitch read the act and began to explain its meaning, but at\\nthat point a tall, stout, round-shouldered landowner, with dyed\\nwhiskers, in a tight uniform that cut the back of his neck, interrupted\\nhim. He went up to the table, and striking it with his finger ring, he\\nshouted loudly: “A ballot! Put it to the vote! No need for more\\ntalking!” Then several voices began to talk all at once, and the tall\\nnobleman with the ring, getting more and more exasperated, shouted more\\nand more loudly. But it was impossible to make out what he said.\\n\\nHe was shouting for the very course Sergey Ivanovitch had proposed; but\\nit was evident that he hated him and all his party, and this feeling of\\nhatred spread through the whole party and roused in opposition to it\\nthe same vindictiveness, though in a more seemly form, on the other\\nside. Shouts were raised, and for a moment all was confusion, so that\\nthe marshal of the province had to call for order.\\n\\n“A ballot! A ballot! Every nobleman sees it! We shed our blood for our\\ncountry!... The confidence of the monarch.... No checking the accounts\\nof the marshal; he’s not a cashier.... But that’s not the point....\\nVotes, please! Beastly!...” shouted furious and violent voices on all\\nsides. Looks and faces were even more violent and furious than their\\nwords. They expressed the most implacable hatred. Levin did not in the\\nleast understand what was the matter, and he marveled at the passion\\nwith which it was disputed whether or not the decision about Flerov\\nshould be put to the vote. He forgot, as Sergey Ivanovitch explained to\\nhim afterwards, this syllogism: that it was necessary for the public\\ngood to get rid of the marshal of the province; that to get rid of the\\nmarshal it was necessary to have a majority of votes; that to get a\\nmajority of votes it was necessary to secure Flerov’s right to vote;\\nthat to secure the recognition of Flerov’s right to vote they must\\ndecide on the interpretation to be put on the act.\\n\\n“And one vote may decide the whole question, and one must be serious\\nand consecutive, if one wants to be of use in public life,” concluded\\nSergey Ivanovitch. But Levin forgot all that, and it was painful to him\\nto see all these excellent persons, for whom he had a respect, in such\\nan unpleasant and vicious state of excitement. To escape from this\\npainful feeling he went away into the other room where there was nobody\\nexcept the waiters at the refreshment bar. Seeing the waiters busy over\\nwashing up the crockery and setting in order their plates and\\nwine-glasses, seeing their calm and cheerful faces, Levin felt an\\nunexpected sense of relief as though he had come out of a stuffy room\\ninto the fresh air. He began walking up and down, looking with pleasure\\nat the waiters. He particularly liked the way one gray-whiskered\\nwaiter, who showed his scorn for the other younger ones and was jeered\\nat by them, was teaching them how to fold up napkins properly. Levin\\nwas just about to enter into conversation with the old waiter, when the\\nsecretary of the court of wardship, a little old man whose specialty it\\nwas to know all the noblemen of the province by name and patronymic,\\ndrew him away.\\n\\n“Please come, Konstantin Dmitrievitch,” he said, “your brother’s\\nlooking for you. They are voting on the legal point.”\\n\\nLevin walked into the room, received a white ball, and followed his\\nbrother, Sergey Ivanovitch, to the table where Sviazhsky was standing\\nwith a significant and ironical face, holding his beard in his fist and\\nsniffing at it. Sergey Ivanovitch put his hand into the box, put the\\nball somewhere, and making room for Levin, stopped. Levin advanced, but\\nutterly forgetting what he was to do, and much embarrassed, he turned\\nto Sergey Ivanovitch with the question, “Where am I to put it?” He\\nasked this softly, at a moment when there was talking going on near, so\\nthat he had hoped his question would not be overheard. But the persons\\nspeaking paused, and his improper question was overheard. Sergey\\nIvanovitch frowned.\\n\\n“That is a matter for each man’s own decision,” he said severely.\\n\\nSeveral people smiled. Levin crimsoned, hurriedly thrust his hand under\\nthe cloth, and put the ball to the right as it was in his right hand.\\nHaving put it in, he recollected that he ought to have thrust his left\\nhand too, and so he thrust it in though too late, and, still more\\novercome with confusion, he beat a hasty retreat into the background.\\n\\n“A hundred and twenty-six for admission! Ninety-eight against!” sang\\nout the voice of the secretary, who could not pronounce the letter _r_.\\nThen there was a laugh; a button and two nuts were found in the box.\\nThe nobleman was allowed the right to vote, and the new party had\\nconquered.\\n\\nBut the old party did not consider themselves conquered. Levin heard\\nthat they were asking Snetkov to stand, and he saw that a crowd of\\nnoblemen was surrounding the marshal, who was saying something. Levin\\nwent nearer. In reply Snetkov spoke of the trust the noblemen of the\\nprovince had placed in him, the affection they had shown him, which he\\ndid not deserve, as his only merit had been his attachment to the\\nnobility, to whom he had devoted twelve years of service. Several times\\nhe repeated the words: “I have served to the best of my powers with\\ntruth and good faith, I value your goodness and thank you,” and\\nsuddenly he stopped short from the tears that choked him, and went out\\nof the room. Whether these tears came from a sense of the injustice\\nbeing done him, from his love for the nobility, or from the strain of\\nthe position he was placed in, feeling himself surrounded by enemies,\\nhis emotion infected the assembly, the majority were touched, and Levin\\nfelt a tenderness for Snetkov.\\n\\nIn the doorway the marshal of the province jostled against Levin.\\n\\n“Beg pardon, excuse me, please,” he said as to a stranger, but\\nrecognizing Levin, he smiled timidly. It seemed to Levin that he would\\nhave liked to say something, but could not speak for emotion. His face\\nand his whole figure in his uniform with the crosses, and white\\ntrousers striped with braid, as he moved hurriedly along, reminded\\nLevin of some hunted beast who sees that he is in evil case. This\\nexpression in the marshal’s face was particularly touching to Levin,\\nbecause, only the day before, he had been at his house about his\\ntrustee business and had seen him in all his grandeur, a kind-hearted,\\nfatherly man. The big house with the old family furniture; the rather\\ndirty, far from stylish, but respectful footmen, unmistakably old house\\nserfs who had stuck to their master; the stout, good-natured wife in a\\ncap with lace and a Turkish shawl, petting her pretty grandchild, her\\ndaughter’s daughter; the young son, a sixth form high school boy,\\ncoming home from school, and greeting his father, kissing his big hand;\\nthe genuine, cordial words and gestures of the old man—all this had the\\nday before roused an instinctive feeling of respect and sympathy in\\nLevin. This old man was a touching and pathetic figure to Levin now,\\nand he longed to say something pleasant to him.\\n\\n“So you’re sure to be our marshal again,” he said.\\n\\n“It’s not likely,” said the marshal, looking round with a scared\\nexpression. “I’m worn out, I’m old. If there are men younger and more\\ndeserving than I, let them serve.”\\n\\nAnd the marshal disappeared through a side door.\\n\\nThe most solemn moment was at hand. They were to proceed immediately to\\nthe election. The leaders of both parties were reckoning white and\\nblack on their fingers.\\n\\nThe discussion upon Flerov had given the new party not only Flerov’s\\nvote, but had also gained time for them, so that they could send to\\nfetch three noblemen who had been rendered unable to take part in the\\nelections by the wiles of the other party. Two noble gentlemen, who had\\na weakness for strong drink, had been made drunk by the partisans of\\nSnetkov, and a third had been robbed of his uniform.\\n\\nOn learning this, the new party had made haste, during the dispute\\nabout Flerov, to send some of their men in a sledge to clothe the\\nstripped gentleman, and to bring along one of the intoxicated to the\\nmeeting.\\n\\n“I’ve brought one, drenched him with water,” said the landowner, who\\nhad gone on this errand, to Sviazhsky. “He’s all right? he’ll do.”\\n\\n“Not too drunk, he won’t fall down?” said Sviazhsky, shaking his head.\\n\\n“No, he’s first-rate. If only they don’t give him any more here....\\nI’ve told the waiter not to give him anything on any account 29\\n\\nThe narrow room, in which they were smoking and taking refreshments,\\nwas full of noblemen. The excitement grew more intense, and every face\\nbetrayed some uneasiness. The excitement was specially keen for the\\nleaders of each party, who knew every detail, and had reckoned up every\\nvote. They were the generals organizing the approaching battle. The\\nrest, like the rank and file before an engagement, though they were\\ngetting ready for the fight, sought for other distractions in the\\ninterval. Some were lunching, standing at the bar, or sitting at the\\ntable; others were walking up and down the long room, smoking\\ncigarettes, and talking with friends whom they had not seen for a long\\nwhile.\\n\\nLevin did not care to eat, and he was not smoking; he did not want to\\njoin his own friends, that is Sergey Ivanovitch, Stepan Arkadyevitch,\\nSviazhsky and the rest, because Vronsky in his equerry’s uniform was\\nstanding with them in eager conversation. Levin had seen him already at\\nthe meeting on the previous day, and he had studiously avoided him, not\\ncaring to greet him. He went to the window and sat down, scanning the\\ngroups, and listening to what was being said around him. He felt\\ndepressed, especially because everyone else was, as he saw, eager,\\nanxious, and interested, and he alone, with an old, toothless little\\nman with mumbling lips wearing a naval uniform, sitting beside him, had\\nno interest in it and nothing to do.\\n\\n“He’s such a blackguard! I have told him so, but it makes no\\ndifference. Only think of it! He couldn’t collect it in three years!”\\nhe heard vigorously uttered by a round-shouldered, short, country\\ngentleman, who had pomaded hair hanging on his embroidered collar, and\\nnew boots obviously put on for the occasion, with heels that tapped\\nenergetically as he spoke. Casting a displeased glance at Levin, this\\ngentleman sharply turned his back.\\n\\n“Yes, it’s a dirty business, there’s no denying,” a small gentleman\\nassented in a high voice.\\n\\nNext, a whole crowd of country gentlemen, surrounding a stout general,\\nhurriedly came near Levin. These persons were unmistakably seeking a\\nplace where they could talk without being overheard.\\n\\n“How dare he say I had his breeches stolen! Pawned them for drink, I\\nexpect. Damn the fellow, prince indeed! He’d better not say it, the\\nbeast!”\\n\\n“But excuse me! They take their stand on the act,” was being said in\\nanother group; “the wife must be registered as noble.”\\n\\n“Oh, damn your acts! I speak from my heart. We’re all gentlemen, aren’t\\nwe? Above suspicion.”\\n\\n“Shall we go on, your excellency, _fine champagne?_”\\n\\nAnother group was following a nobleman, who was shouting something in a\\nloud voice; it was one of the three intoxicated gentlemen.\\n\\n“I always advised Marya Semyonovna to let for a fair rent, for she can\\nnever save a profit,” he heard a pleasant voice say. The speaker was a\\ncountry gentleman with gray whiskers, wearing the regimental uniform of\\nan old general staff-officer. It was the very landowner Levin had met\\nat Sviazhsky’s. He knew him at once. The landowner too stared at Levin,\\nand they exchanged greetings.\\n\\n“Very glad to see you! To be sure! I remember you very well. Last year\\nat our district marshal, Nikolay Ivanovitch’s.”\\n\\n“Well, and how is your land doing?” asked Levin.\\n\\n“Oh, still just the same, always at a loss,” the landowner answered\\nwith a resigned smile, but with an expression of serenity and\\nconviction that so it must be. “And how do you come to be in our\\nprovince?” he asked. “Come to take part in our _coup d’état?_” he said,\\nconfidently pronouncing the French words with a bad accent. “All\\nRussia’s here—gentlemen of the bedchamber, and everything short of the\\nministry.” He pointed to the imposing figure of Stepan Arkadyevitch in\\nwhite trousers and his court uniform, walking by with a general.\\n\\n“I ought to own that I don’t very well understand the drift of the\\nprovincial elections,” said Levin.\\n\\nThe landowner looked at him.\\n\\n“Why, what is there to understand? There’s no meaning in it at all.\\nIt’s a decaying institution that goes on running only by the force of\\ninertia. Just look, the very uniforms tell you that it’s an assembly of\\njustices of the peace, permanent members of the court, and so on, but\\nnot of noblemen.”\\n\\n“Then why do you come?” asked Levin.\\n\\n“From habit, nothing else. Then, too, one must keep up connections.\\nIt’s a moral obligation of a sort. And then, to tell the truth, there’s\\none’s own interests. My son-in-law wants to stand as a permanent\\nmember; they’re not rich people, and he must be brought forward. These\\ngentlemen, now, what do they come for?” he said, pointing to the\\nmalignant gentleman, who was talking at the high table.\\n\\n“That’s the new generation of nobility.”\\n\\n“New it may be, but nobility it isn’t. They’re proprietors of a sort,\\nbut we’re the landowners. As noblemen, they’re cutting their own\\nthroats.”\\n\\n“But you say it’s an institution that’s served its time.”\\n\\n“That it may be, but still it ought to be treated a little more\\nrespectfully. Snetkov, now.... We may be of use, or we may not, but\\nwe’re the growth of a thousand years. If we’re laying out a garden,\\nplanning one before the house, you know, and there you’ve a tree that’s\\nstood for centuries in the very spot.... Old and gnarled it may be, and\\nyet you don’t cut down the old fellow to make room for the flowerbeds,\\nbut lay out your beds so as to take advantage of the tree. You won’t\\ngrow him again in a year,” he said cautiously, and he immediately\\nchanged the conversation. “Well, and how is your land doing?”\\n\\n“Oh, not very well. I make five per cent.”\\n\\n“Yes, but you don’t reckon your own work. Aren’t you worth something\\ntoo? I’ll tell you my own case. Before I took to seeing after the land,\\nI had a salary of three hundred pounds from the service. Now I do more\\nwork than I did in the service, and like you I get five per cent. on\\nthe land, and thank God for that. But one’s work is thrown in for\\nnothing.”\\n\\n“Then why do you do it, if it’s a clear loss?”\\n\\n“Oh, well, one does it! What would you have? It’s habit, and one knows\\nit’s how it should be. And what’s more,” the landowner went on, leaning\\nhis elbows on the window and chatting on, “my son, I must tell you, has\\nno taste for it. There’s no doubt he’ll be a scientific man. So\\nthere’ll be no one to keep it up. And yet one does it. Here this year\\nI’ve planted an orchard.”\\n\\n“Yes, yes,” said Levin, “that’s perfectly true. I always feel there’s\\nno real balance of gain in my work on the land, and yet one does it....\\nIt’s a sort of duty one feels to the land.”\\n\\n“But I tell you what,” the landowner pursued; “a neighbor of mine, a\\nmerchant, was at my place. We walked about the fields and the garden.\\n‘No,’ said he, ‘Stepan Vassilievitch, everything’s well looked after,\\nbut your garden’s neglected.’ But, as a fact, it’s well kept up. ‘To my\\nthinking, I’d cut down that lime-tree. Here you’ve thousands of limes,\\nand each would make two good bundles of bark. And nowadays that bark’s\\nworth something. I’d cut down the lot.’”\\n\\n“And with what he made he’d increase his stock, or buy some land for a\\ntrifle, and let it out in lots to the peasants,” Levin added, smiling.\\nHe had evidently more than once come across those commercial\\ncalculations. “And he’d make his fortune. But you and I must thank God\\nif we keep what we’ve got and leave it to our children.”\\n\\n“You’re married, I’ve heard?” said the landowner.\\n\\n“Yes,” Levin answered, with proud satisfaction. “Yes, it’s rather\\nstrange,” he went on. “So we live without making anything, as though we\\nwere ancient vestals set to keep in a fire.”\\n\\nThe landowner chuckled under his white mustaches.\\n\\n“There are some among us, too, like our friend Nikolay Ivanovitch, or\\nCount Vronsky, that’s settled here lately, who try to carry on their\\nhusbandry as though it were a factory; but so far it leads to nothing\\nbut making away with capital on it.”\\n\\n“But why is it we don’t do like the merchants? Why don’t we cut down\\nour parks for timber?” said Levin, returning to a thought that had\\nstruck him.\\n\\n“Why, as you said, to keep the fire in. Besides that’s not work for a\\nnobleman. And our work as noblemen isn’t done here at the elections,\\nbut yonder, each in our corner. There’s a class instinct, too, of what\\none ought and oughtn’t to do. There’s the peasants, too, I wonder at\\nthem sometimes; any good peasant tries to take all the land he can.\\nHowever bad the land is, he’ll work it. Without a return too. At a\\nsimple loss.”\\n\\n“Just as we do,” said Levin. “Very, very glad to have met you,” he\\nadded, seeing Sviazhsky approaching him.\\n\\n“And here we’ve met for the first time since we met at your place,”\\nsaid the landowner to Sviazhsky, “and we’ve had a good talk too.”\\n\\n“Well, have you been attacking the new order of things?” said Sviazhsky\\nwith a smile.\\n\\n“That we’re bound to do.”\\n\\n“You’ve relieved your feelings 30\\n\\nSviazhsky took Levin’s arm, and went with him to his own friends.\\n\\nThis time there was no avoiding Vronsky. He was standing with Stepan\\nArkadyevitch and Sergey Ivanovitch, and looking straight at Levin as he\\ndrew near.\\n\\n“Delighted! I believe I’ve had the pleasure of meeting you ... at\\nPrincess Shtcherbatskaya’s,” he said, giving Levin his hand.\\n\\n“Yes, I quite remember our meeting,” said Levin, and blushing crimson,\\nhe turned away immediately, and began talking to his brother.\\n\\nWith a slight smile Vronsky went on talking to Sviazhsky, obviously\\nwithout the slightest inclination to enter into conversation with\\nLevin. But Levin, as he talked to his brother, was continually looking\\nround at Vronsky, trying to think of something to say to him to gloss\\nover his rudeness.\\n\\n“What are we waiting for now?” asked Levin, looking at Sviazhsky and\\nVronsky.\\n\\n“For Snetkov. He has to refuse or to consent to stand,” answered\\nSviazhsky.\\n\\n“Well, and what has he done, consented or not?”\\n\\n“That’s the point, that he’s done neither,” said Vronsky.\\n\\n“And if he refuses, who will stand then?” asked Levin, looking at\\nVronsky.\\n\\n“Whoever chooses to,” said Sviazhsky.\\n\\n“Shall you?” asked Levin.\\n\\n“Certainly not I,” said Sviazhsky, looking confused, and turning an\\nalarmed glance at the malignant gentleman, who was standing beside\\nSergey Ivanovitch.\\n\\n“Who then? Nevyedovsky?” said Levin, feeling he was putting his foot\\ninto it.\\n\\nBut this was worse still. Nevyedovsky and Sviazhsky were the two\\ncandidates.\\n\\n“I certainly shall not, under any circumstances,” answered the\\nmalignant gentleman.\\n\\nThis was Nevyedovsky himself. Sviazhsky introduced him to Levin.\\n\\n“Well, you find it exciting too?” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, winking at\\nVronsky. “It’s something like a race. One might bet on it.”\\n\\n“Yes, it is keenly exciting,” said Vronsky. “And once taking the thing\\nup, one’s eager to see it through. It’s a fight!” he said, scowling and\\nsetting his powerful jaws.\\n\\n“What a capable fellow Sviazhsky is! Sees it all so clearly.”\\n\\n“Oh, yes!” Vronsky assented indifferently.\\n\\nA silence followed, during which Vronsky—since he had to look at\\nsomething—looked at Levin, at his feet, at his uniform, then at his\\nface, and noticing his gloomy eyes fixed upon him, he said, in order to\\nsay something:\\n\\n“How is it that you, living constantly in the country, are not a\\njustice of the peace? You are not in the uniform of one.”\\n\\n“It’s because I consider that the justice of the peace is a silly\\ninstitution,” Levin answered gloomily. He had been all the time looking\\nfor an opportunity to enter into conversation with Vronsky, so as to\\nsmooth over his rudeness at their first meeting.\\n\\n“I don’t think so, quite the contrary,” Vronsky said, with quiet\\nsurprise.\\n\\n“It’s a plaything,” Levin cut him short. “We don’t want justices of the\\npeace. I’ve never had a single thing to do with them during eight\\nyears. And what I have had was decided wrongly by them. The justice of\\nthe peace is over thirty miles from me. For some matter of two roubles\\nI should have to send a lawyer, who costs me fifteen.”\\n\\nAnd he related how a peasant had stolen some flour from the miller, and\\nwhen the miller told him of it, had lodged a complaint for slander. All\\nthis was utterly uncalled for and stupid, and Levin felt it himself as\\nhe said it.\\n\\n“Oh, this is such an original fellow!” said Stepan Arkadyevitch with\\nhis most soothing, almond-oil smile. “But come along; I think they’re\\nvoting....”\\n\\nAnd they separated.\\n\\n“I can’t understand,” said Sergey Ivanovitch, who had observed his\\nbrother’s clumsiness, “I can’t understand how anyone can be so\\nabsolutely devoid of political tact. That’s where we Russians are so\\ndeficient. The marshal of the province is our opponent, and with him\\nyou’re _ami cochon_, and you beg him to stand. Count Vronsky, now ...\\nI’m not making a friend of him; he’s asked me to dinner, and I’m not\\ngoing; but he’s one of our side—why make an enemy of him? Then you ask\\nNevyedovsky if he’s going to stand. That’s not a thing to do.”\\n\\n“Oh, I don’t understand it at all! And it’s all such nonsense,” Levin\\nanswered gloomily.\\n\\n“You say it’s all such nonsense, but as soon as you have anything to do\\nwith it, you make a muddle.”\\n\\nLevin did not answer, and they walked together into the big room.\\n\\nThe marshal of the province, though he was vaguely conscious in the air\\nof some trap being prepared for him, and though he had not been called\\nupon by all to stand, had still made up his mind to stand. All was\\nsilence in the room. The secretary announced in a loud voice that the\\ncaptain of the guards, Mihail Stepanovitch Snetkov, would now be\\nballoted for as marshal of the province.\\n\\nThe district marshals walked carrying plates, on which were balls, from\\ntheir tables to the high table, and the election began.\\n\\n“Put it in the right side,” whispered Stepan Arkadyevitch, as with his\\nbrother Levin followed the marshal of his district to the table. But\\nLevin had forgotten by now the calculations that had been explained to\\nhim, and was afraid Stepan Arkadyevitch might be mistaken in saying\\n“the right side.” Surely Snetkov was the enemy. As he went up, he held\\nthe ball in his right hand, but thinking he was wrong, just at the box\\nhe changed to the left hand, and undoubtedly put the ball to the left.\\nAn adept in the business, standing at the box and seeing by the mere\\naction of the elbow where each put his ball, scowled with annoyance. It\\nwas no good for him to use his insight.\\n\\nEverything was still, and the counting of the balls was heard. Then a\\nsingle voice rose and proclaimed the numbers for and against. The\\nmarshal had been voted for by a considerable majority. All was noise\\nand eager movement towards the doors. Snetkov came in, and the nobles\\nthronged round him, congratulating him.\\n\\n“Well, now is it over?” Levin asked Sergey Ivanovitch.\\n\\n“It’s only just beginning,” Sviazhsky said, replying for Sergey\\nIvanovitch with a smile. “Some other candidate may receive more votes\\nthan the marshal.”\\n\\nLevin had quite forgotten about that. Now he could only remember that\\nthere was some sort of trickery in it, but he was too bored to think\\nwhat it was exactly. He felt depressed, and longed to get out of the\\ncrowd.\\n\\nAs no one was paying any attention to him, and no one apparently needed\\nhim, he quietly slipped away into the little room where the\\nrefreshments were, and again had a great sense of comfort when he saw\\nthe waiters. The little old waiter pressed him to have something, and\\nLevin agreed. After eating a cutlet with beans and talking to the\\nwaiters of their former masters, Levin, not wishing to go back to the\\nhall, where it was all so distasteful to him, proceeded to walk through\\nthe galleries. The galleries were full of fashionably dressed ladies,\\nleaning over the balustrade and trying not to lose a single word of\\nwhat was being said below. With the ladies were sitting and standing\\nsmart lawyers, high school teachers in spectacles, and officers.\\nEverywhere they were talking of the election, and of how worried the\\nmarshal was, and how splendid the discussions had been. In one group\\nLevin heard his brother’s praises. One lady was telling a lawyer:\\n\\n“How glad I am I heard Koznishev! It’s worth losing one’s dinner. He’s\\nexquisite! So clear and distinct all of it! There’s not one of you in\\nthe law courts that speaks like that. The only one is Meidel, and he’s\\nnot so eloquent by a long way.”\\n\\nFinding a free place, Levin leaned over the balustrade and began\\nlooking and listening.\\n\\nAll the noblemen were sitting railed off behind barriers according to\\ntheir districts. In the middle of the room stood a man in a uniform,\\nwho shouted in a loud, high voice:\\n\\n“As a candidate for the marshalship of the nobility of the province we\\ncall upon staff-captain Yevgeney Ivanovitch Apuhtin!” A dead silence\\nfollowed, and then a weak old voice was heard: “Declined!”\\n\\n“We call upon the privy councilor Pyotr Petrovitch Bol,” the voice\\nbegan again.\\n\\n“Declined!” a high boyish voice replied.\\n\\nAgain it began, and again “Declined.” And so it went on for about an\\nhour. Levin, with his elbows on the balustrade, looked and listened. At\\nfirst he wondered and wanted to know what it meant; then feeling sure\\nthat he could not make it out he began to be bored. Then recalling all\\nthe excitement and vindictiveness he had seen on all the faces, he felt\\nsad; he made up his mind to go, and went downstairs. As he passed\\nthrough the entry to the galleries he met a dejected high school boy\\nwalking up and down with tired-looking eyes. On the stairs he met a\\ncouple—a lady running quickly on her high heels and the jaunty deputy\\nprosecutor.\\n\\n“I told you you weren’t late,” the deputy prosecutor was saying at the\\nmoment when Levin moved aside to let the lady pass.\\n\\nLevin was on the stairs to the way out, and was just feeling in his\\nwaistcoat pocket for the number of his overcoat, when the secretary\\novertook him.\\n\\n“This way, please, Konstantin Dmitrievitch; they are voting.”\\n\\nThe candidate who was being voted on was Nevyedovsky, who had so\\nstoutly denied all idea of standing. Levin went up to the door of the\\nroom; it was locked. The secretary knocked, the door opened, and Levin\\nwas met by two red-faced gentlemen, who darted out.\\n\\n“I can’t stand any more of it,” said one red-faced gentleman.\\n\\nAfter them the face of the marshal of the province was poked out. His\\nface was dreadful-looking from exhaustion and dismay.\\n\\n“I told you not to let anyone out!” he cried to the doorkeeper.\\n\\n“I let someone in, your excellency!”\\n\\n“Mercy on us!” and with a heavy sigh the marshal of the province walked\\nwith downcast head to the high table in the middle of the room, his\\nlegs staggering in his white trousers.\\n\\nNevyedovsky had scored a higher majority, as they had planned, and he\\nwas the new marshal of the province. Many people were amused, many were\\npleased and happy, many were in ecstasies, many were disgusted and\\nunhappy. The former marshal of the province was in a state of despair,\\nwhich he could not conceal. When Nevyedovsky went out of the room, the\\ncrowd thronged round him and followed him enthusiastically, just as\\nthey had followed the governor who had opened the meetings, and just as\\nthey had followed Snetkov when he was elected 31\\n\\nThe newly elected marshal and many of the successful party dined that\\nday with Vronsky.\\n\\nVronsky had come to the elections partly because he was bored in the\\ncountry and wanted to show Anna his right to independence, and also to\\nrepay Sviazhsky by his support at the election for all the trouble he\\nhad taken for Vronsky at the district council election, but chiefly in\\norder strictly to perform all those duties of a nobleman and landowner\\nwhich he had taken upon himself. But he had not in the least expected\\nthat the election would so interest him, so keenly excite him, and that\\nhe would be so good at this kind of thing. He was quite a new man in\\nthe circle of the nobility of the province, but his success was\\nunmistakable, and he was not wrong in supposing that he had already\\nobtained a certain influence. This influence was due to his wealth and\\nreputation, the capital house in the town lent him by his old friend\\nShirkov, who had a post in the department of finances and was director\\nof a flourishing bank in Kashin; the excellent cook Vronsky had brought\\nfrom the country, and his friendship with the governor, who was a\\nschoolfellow of Vronsky’s—a schoolfellow he had patronized and\\nprotected indeed. But what contributed more than all to his success was\\nhis direct, equable manner with everyone, which very quickly made the\\nmajority of the noblemen reverse the current opinion of his supposed\\nhaughtiness. He was himself conscious that, except that whimsical\\ngentleman married to Kitty Shtcherbatskaya, who had _à propos de\\nbottes_ poured out a stream of irrelevant absurdities with such\\nspiteful fury, every nobleman with whom he had made acquaintance had\\nbecome his adherent. He saw clearly, and other people recognized it,\\ntoo, that he had done a great deal to secure the success of\\nNevyedovsky. And now at his own table, celebrating Nevyedovsky’s\\nelection, he was experiencing an agreeable sense of triumph over the\\nsuccess of his candidate. The election itself had so fascinated him\\nthat, if he could succeed in getting married during the next three\\nyears, he began to think of standing himself—much as after winning a\\nrace ridden by a jockey, he had longed to ride a race himself.\\n\\nToday he was celebrating the success of his jockey. Vronsky sat at the\\nhead of the table, on his right hand sat the young governor, a general\\nof high rank. To all the rest he was the chief man in the province, who\\nhad solemnly opened the elections with his speech, and aroused a\\nfeeling of respect and even of awe in many people, as Vronsky saw; to\\nVronsky he was little Katka Maslov—that had been his nickname in the\\nPages’ Corps—whom he felt to be shy and tried to _mettre à son aise_.\\nOn the left hand sat Nevyedovsky with his youthful, stubborn, and\\nmalignant face. With him Vronsky was simple and deferential.\\n\\nSviazhsky took his failure very light-heartedly. It was indeed no\\nfailure in his eyes, as he said himself, turning, glass in hand, to\\nNevyedovsky; they could not have found a better representative of the\\nnew movement, which the nobility ought to follow. And so every honest\\nperson, as he said, was on the side of today’s success and was\\nrejoicing over it.\\n\\nStepan Arkadyevitch was glad, too, that he was having a good time, and\\nthat everyone was pleased. The episode of the elections served as a\\ngood occasion for a capital dinner. Sviazhsky comically imitated the\\ntearful discourse of the marshal, and observed, addressing Nevyedovsky,\\nthat his excellency would have to select another more complicated\\nmethod of auditing the accounts than tears. Another nobleman jocosely\\ndescribed how footmen in stockings had been ordered for the marshal’s\\nball, and how now they would have to be sent back unless the new\\nmarshal would give a ball with footmen in stockings.\\n\\nContinually during dinner they said of Nevyedovsky: “our marshal,” and\\n“your excellency.”\\n\\nThis was said with the same pleasure with which a bride is called\\n“Madame” and her husband’s name. Nevyedovsky affected to be not merely\\nindifferent but scornful of this appellation, but it was obvious that\\nhe was highly delighted, and had to keep a curb on himself not to\\nbetray the triumph which was unsuitable to their new liberal tone.\\n\\nAfter dinner several telegrams were sent to people interested in the\\nresult of the election. And Stepan Arkadyevitch, who was in high good\\nhumor, sent Darya Alexandrovna a telegram: “Nevyedovsky elected by\\ntwenty votes. Congratulations. Tell people.” He dictated it aloud,\\nsaying: “We must let them share our rejoicing.” Darya Alexandrovna,\\ngetting the message, simply sighed over the rouble wasted on it, and\\nunderstood that it was an after-dinner affair. She knew Stiva had a\\nweakness after dining for _faire jouer le télégraphe._\\n\\n\\n\\nEverything, together with the excellent dinner and the wine, not from\\nRussian merchants, but imported direct from abroad, was extremely\\ndignified, simple, and enjoyable. The party—some twenty—had been\\nselected by Sviazhsky from among the more active new liberals, all of\\nthe same way of thinking, who were at the same time clever and well\\nbred. They drank, also half in jest, to the health of the new marshal\\nof the province, of the governor, of the bank director, and of “our\\namiable host.”\\n\\nVronsky was satisfied. He had never expected to find so pleasant a tone\\nin the provinces.\\n\\nTowards the end of dinner it was still more lively. The governor asked\\nVronsky to come to a concert for the benefit of the Servians which his\\nwife, who was anxious to make his acquaintance, had been getting up.\\n\\n“There’ll be a ball, and you’ll see the belle of the province. Worth\\nseeing, really.”\\n\\n“Not in my line,” Vronsky answered. He liked that English phrase. But\\nhe smiled, and promised to come.\\n\\nBefore they rose from the table, when all of them were smoking,\\nVronsky’s valet went up to him with a letter on a tray.\\n\\n“From Vozdvizhenskoe by special messenger,” he said with a significant\\nexpression.\\n\\n“Astonishing! how like he is to the deputy prosecutor Sventitsky,” said\\none of the guests in French of the valet, while Vronsky, frowning, read\\nthe letter.\\n\\nThe letter was from Anna. Before he read the letter, he knew its\\ncontents. Expecting the elections to be over in five days, he had\\npromised to be back on Friday. Today was Saturday, and he knew that the\\nletter contained reproaches for not being back at the time fixed. The\\nletter he had sent the previous evening had probably not reached her\\nyet.\\n\\nThe letter was what he had expected, but the form of it was unexpected,\\nand particularly disagreeable to him. “Annie is very ill, the doctor\\nsays it may be inflammation. I am losing my head all alone. Princess\\nVarvara is no help, but a hindrance. I expected you the day before\\nyesterday, and yesterday, and now I am sending to find out where you\\nare and what you are doing. I wanted to come myself, but thought better\\nof it, knowing you would dislike it. Send some answer, that I may know\\nwhat to do.”\\n\\nThe child ill, yet she had thought of coming herself. Their daughter\\nill, and this hostile tone.\\n\\nThe innocent festivities over the election, and this gloomy, burdensome\\nlove to which he had to return struck Vronsky by their contrast. But he\\nhad to go, and by the first train that night he set off home 32\\n\\nBefore Vronsky’s departure for the elections, Anna had reflected that\\nthe scenes constantly repeated between them each time he left home,\\nmight only make him cold to her instead of attaching him to her, and\\nresolved to do all she could to control herself so as to bear the\\nparting with composure. But the cold, severe glance with which he had\\nlooked at her when he came to tell her he was going had wounded her,\\nand before he had started her peace of mind was destroyed.\\n\\nIn solitude afterwards, thinking over that glance which had expressed\\nhis right to freedom, she came, as she always did, to the same\\npoint—the sense of her own humiliation. “He has the right to go away\\nwhen and where he chooses. Not simply to go away, but to leave me. He\\nhas every right, and I have none. But knowing that, he ought not to do\\nit. What has he done, though?... He looked at me with a cold, severe\\nexpression. Of course that is something indefinable, impalpable, but it\\nhas never been so before, and that glance means a great deal,” she\\nthought. “That glance shows the beginning of indifference.”\\n\\nAnd though she felt sure that a coldness was beginning, there was\\nnothing she could do, she could not in any way alter her relations to\\nhim. Just as before, only by love and by charm could she keep him. And\\nso, just as before, only by occupation in the day, by morphine at\\nnight, could she stifle the fearful thought of what would be if he\\nceased to love her. It is true there was still one means; not to keep\\nhim—for that she wanted nothing more than his love—but to be nearer to\\nhim, to be in such a position that he would not leave her. That means\\nwas divorce and marriage. And she began to long for that, and made up\\nher mind to agree to it the first time he or Stiva approached her on\\nthe subject.\\n\\nAbsorbed in such thoughts, she passed five days without him, the five\\ndays that he was to be at the elections.\\n\\nWalks, conversation with Princess Varvara, visits to the hospital, and,\\nmost of all, reading—reading of one book after another—filled up her\\ntime. But on the sixth day, when the coachman came back without him,\\nshe felt that now she was utterly incapable of stifling the thought of\\nhim and of what he was doing there, just at that time her little girl\\nwas taken ill. Anna began to look after her, but even that did not\\ndistract her mind, especially as the illness was not serious. However\\nhard she tried, she could not love this little child, and to feign love\\nwas beyond her powers. Towards the evening of that day, still alone,\\nAnna was in such a panic about him that she decided to start for the\\ntown, but on second thoughts wrote him the contradictory letter that\\nVronsky received, and without reading it through, sent it off by a\\nspecial messenger. The next morning she received his letter and\\nregretted her own. She dreaded a repetition of the severe look he had\\nflung at her at parting, especially when he knew that the baby was not\\ndangerously ill. But still she was glad she had written to him. At this\\nmoment Anna was positively admitting to herself that she was a burden\\nto him, that he would relinquish his freedom regretfully to return to\\nher, and in spite of that she was glad he was coming. Let him weary of\\nher, but he would be here with her, so that she would see him, would\\nknow of every action he took.\\n\\nShe was sitting in the drawing-room near a lamp, with a new volume of\\nTaine, and as she read, listening to the sound of the wind outside, and\\nevery minute expecting the carriage to arrive. Several times she had\\nfancied she heard the sound of wheels, but she had been mistaken. At\\nlast she heard not the sound of wheels, but the coachman’s shout and\\nthe dull rumble in the covered entry. Even Princess Varvara, playing\\npatience, confirmed this, and Anna, flushing hotly, got up; but instead\\nof going down, as she had done twice before, she stood still. She\\nsuddenly felt ashamed of her duplicity, but even more she dreaded how\\nhe might meet her. All feeling of wounded pride had passed now; she was\\nonly afraid of the expression of his displeasure. She remembered that\\nher child had been perfectly well again for the last two days. She felt\\npositively vexed with her for getting better from the very moment her\\nletter was sent off. Then she thought of him, that he was here, all of\\nhim, with his hands, his eyes. She heard his voice. And forgetting\\neverything, she ran joyfully to meet him.\\n\\n“Well, how is Annie?” he said timidly from below, looking up to Anna as\\nshe ran down to him.\\n\\nHe was sitting on a chair, and a footman was pulling off his warm\\nover-boot.\\n\\n“Oh, she is better.”\\n\\n“And you?” he said, shaking himself.\\n\\nShe took his hand in both of hers, and drew it to her waist, never\\ntaking her eyes off him.\\n\\n“Well, I’m glad,” he said, coldly scanning her, her hair, her dress,\\nwhich he knew she had put on for him. All was charming, but how many\\ntimes it had charmed him! And the stern, stony expression that she so\\ndreaded settled upon his face.\\n\\n“Well, I’m glad. And are you well?” he said, wiping his damp beard with\\nhis handkerchief and kissing her hand.\\n\\n“Never mind,” she thought, “only let him be here, and so long as he’s\\nhere he cannot, he dare not, cease to love me.”\\n\\nThe evening was spent happily and gaily in the presence of Princess\\nVarvara, who complained to him that Anna had been taking morphine in\\nhis absence.\\n\\n“What am I to do? I couldn’t sleep.... My thoughts prevented me. When\\nhe’s here I never take it—hardly ever.”\\n\\nHe told her about the election, and Anna knew how by adroit questions\\nto bring him to what gave him most pleasure—his own success. She told\\nhim of everything that interested him at home; and all that she told\\nhim was of the most cheerful description.\\n\\nBut late in the evening, when they were alone, Anna, seeing that she\\nhad regained complete possession of him, wanted to erase the painful\\nimpression of the glance he had given her for her letter. She said:\\n\\n“Tell me frankly, you were vexed at getting my letter, and you didn’t\\nbelieve me?”\\n\\nAs soon as she had said it, she felt that however warm his feelings\\nwere to her, he had not forgiven her for that.\\n\\n“Yes,” he said, “the letter was so strange. First, Annie ill, and then\\nyou thought of coming yourself.”\\n\\n“It was all the truth.”\\n\\n“Oh, I don’t doubt it.”\\n\\n“Yes, you do doubt it. You are vexed, I see.”\\n\\n“Not for one moment. I’m only vexed, that’s true, that you seem somehow\\nunwilling to admit that there are duties....”\\n\\n“The duty of going to a concert....”\\n\\n“But we won’t talk about it,” he said.\\n\\n“Why not talk about it?” she said.\\n\\n“I only meant to say that matters of real importance may turn up. Now,\\nfor instance, I shall have to go to Moscow to arrange about the\\nhouse.... Oh, Anna, why are you so irritable? Don’t you know that I\\ncan’t live without you?”\\n\\n“If so,” said Anna, her voice suddenly changing, “it means that you are\\nsick of this life.... Yes, you will come for a day and go away, as men\\ndo....”\\n\\n“Anna, that’s cruel. I am ready to give up my whole life.”\\n\\nBut she did not hear him.\\n\\n“If you go to Moscow, I will go too. I will not stay here. Either we\\nmust separate or else live together.”\\n\\n“Why, you know, that’s my one desire. But for that....”\\n\\n“We must get a divorce. I will write to him. I see I cannot go on like\\nthis.... But I will come with you to Moscow.”\\n\\n“You talk as if you were threatening me. But I desire nothing so much\\nas never to be parted from you,” said Vronsky, smiling.\\n\\nBut as he said these words there gleamed in his eyes not merely a cold\\nlook, but the vindictive look of a man persecuted and made cruel.\\n\\nShe saw the look and correctly divined its meaning.\\n\\n“If so, it’s a calamity!” that glance told her. It was a moment’s\\nimpression, but she never forgot it.\\n\\nAnna wrote to her husband asking him about a divorce, and towards the\\nend of November, taking leave of Princess Varvara, who wanted to go to\\nPetersburg, she went with Vronsky to Moscow. Expecting every day an\\nanswer from Alexey Alexandrovitch, and after that the divorce, they now\\nestablished themselves together like married people.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPART SEVEN 1\\n\\n\\nThe Levins had been three months in Moscow. The date had long passed on\\nwhich, according to the most trustworthy calculations of people learned\\nin such matters, Kitty should have been confined. But she was still\\nabout, and there was nothing to show that her time was any nearer than\\ntwo months ago. The doctor, the monthly nurse, and Dolly and her\\nmother, and most of all Levin, who could not think of the approaching\\nevent without terror, began to be impatient and uneasy. Kitty was the\\nonly person who felt perfectly calm and happy.\\n\\nShe was distinctly conscious now of the birth of a new feeling of love\\nfor the future child, for her to some extent actually existing already,\\nand she brooded blissfully over this feeling. He was not by now\\naltogether a part of herself, but sometimes lived his own life\\nindependently of her. Often this separate being gave her pain, but at\\nthe same time she wanted to laugh with a strange new joy.\\n\\nAll the people she loved were with her, and all were so good to her, so\\nattentively caring for her, so entirely pleasant was everything\\npresented to her, that if she had not known and felt that it must all\\nsoon be over, she could not have wished for a better and pleasanter\\nlife. The only thing that spoiled the charm of this manner of life was\\nthat her husband was not here as she loved him to be, and as he was in\\nthe country.\\n\\nShe liked his serene, friendly, and hospitable manner in the country.\\nIn the town he seemed continually uneasy and on his guard, as though he\\nwere afraid someone would be rude to him, and still more to her. At\\nhome in the country, knowing himself distinctly to be in his right\\nplace, he was never in haste to be off elsewhere. He was never\\nunoccupied. Here in town he was in a continual hurry, as though afraid\\nof missing something, and yet he had nothing to do. And she felt sorry\\nfor him. To others, she knew, he did not appear an object of pity. On\\nthe contrary, when Kitty looked at him in society, as one sometimes\\nlooks at those one loves, trying to see him as if he were a stranger,\\nso as to catch the impression he must make on others, she saw with a\\npanic even of jealous fear that he was far indeed from being a pitiable\\nfigure, that he was very attractive with his fine breeding, his rather\\nold-fashioned, reserved courtesy with women, his powerful figure, and\\nstriking, as she thought, and expressive face. But she saw him not from\\nwithout, but from within; she saw that here he was not himself; that\\nwas the only way she could define his condition to herself. Sometimes\\nshe inwardly reproached him for his inability to live in the town;\\nsometimes she recognized that it was really hard for him to order his\\nlife here so that he could be satisfied with it.\\n\\nWhat had he to do, indeed? He did not care for cards; he did not go to\\na club. Spending the time with jovial gentlemen of Oblonsky’s type—she\\nknew now what that meant ... it meant drinking and going somewhere\\nafter drinking. She could not think without horror of where men went on\\nsuch occasions. Was he to go into society? But she knew he could only\\nfind satisfaction in that if he took pleasure in the society of young\\nwomen, and that she could not wish for. Should he stay at home with\\nher, her mother and her sisters? But much as she liked and enjoyed\\ntheir conversations forever on the same subjects—“Aline-Nadine,” as the\\nold prince called the sisters’ talks—she knew it must bore him. What\\nwas there left for him to do? To go on writing at his book he had\\nindeed attempted, and at first he used to go to the library and make\\nextracts and look up references for his book. But, as he told her, the\\nmore he did nothing, the less time he had to do anything. And besides,\\nhe complained that he had talked too much about his book here, and that\\nconsequently all his ideas about it were muddled and had lost their\\ninterest for him.\\n\\nOne advantage in this town life was that quarrels hardly ever happened\\nbetween them here in town. Whether it was that their conditions were\\ndifferent, or that they had both become more careful and sensible in\\nthat respect, they had no quarrels in Moscow from jealousy, which they\\nhad so dreaded when they moved from the country.\\n\\nOne event, an event of great importance to both from that point of\\nview, did indeed happen—that was Kitty’s meeting with Vronsky.\\n\\nThe old Princess Marya Borissovna, Kitty’s godmother, who had always\\nbeen very fond of her, had insisted on seeing her. Kitty, though she\\ndid not go into society at all on account of her condition, went with\\nher father to see the venerable old lady, and there met Vronsky.\\n\\nThe only thing Kitty could reproach herself for at this meeting was\\nthat at the instant when she recognized in his civilian dress the\\nfeatures once so familiar to her, her breath failed her, the blood\\nrushed to her heart, and a vivid blush—she felt it—overspread her face.\\nBut this lasted only a few seconds. Before her father, who purposely\\nbegan talking in a loud voice to Vronsky, had finished, she was\\nperfectly ready to look at Vronsky, to speak to him, if necessary,\\nexactly as she spoke to Princess Marya Borissovna, and more than that,\\nto do so in such a way that everything to the faintest intonation and\\nsmile would have been approved by her husband, whose unseen presence\\nshe seemed to feel about her at that instant.\\n\\nShe said a few words to him, even smiled serenely at his joke about the\\nelections, which he called “our parliament.” (She had to smile to show\\nshe saw the joke.) But she turned away immediately to Princess Marya\\nBorissovna, and did not once glance at him till he got up to go; then\\nshe looked at him, but evidently only because it would be uncivil not\\nto look at a man when he is saying good-bye.\\n\\nShe was grateful to her father for saying nothing to her about their\\nmeeting Vronsky, but she saw by his special warmth to her after the\\nvisit during their usual walk that he was pleased with her. She was\\npleased with herself. She had not expected she would have had the\\npower, while keeping somewhere in the bottom of her heart all the\\nmemories of her old feeling for Vronsky, not only to seem but to be\\nperfectly indifferent and composed with him.\\n\\nLevin flushed a great deal more than she when she told him she had met\\nVronsky at Princess Marya Borissovna’s. It was very hard for her to\\ntell him this, but still harder to go on speaking of the details of the\\nmeeting, as he did not question her, but simply gazed at her with a\\nfrown.\\n\\n“I am very sorry you weren’t there,” she said. “Not that you weren’t in\\nthe room ... I couldn’t have been so natural in your presence ... I am\\nblushing now much more, much, much more,” she said, blushing till the\\ntears came into her eyes. “But that you couldn’t see through a crack.”\\n\\nThe truthful eyes told Levin that she was satisfied with herself, and\\nin spite of her blushing he was quickly reassured and began questioning\\nher, which was all she wanted. When he had heard everything, even to\\nthe detail that for the first second she could not help flushing, but\\nthat afterwards she was just as direct and as much at her ease as with\\nany chance acquaintance, Levin was quite happy again and said he was\\nglad of it, and would not now behave as stupidly as he had done at the\\nelection, but would try the first time he met Vronsky to be as friendly\\nas possible.\\n\\n“It’s so wretched to feel that there’s a man almost an enemy whom it’s\\npainful to meet,” said Levin. “I’m very, very glad 2\\n\\n“Go, please, go then and call on the Bols,” Kitty said to her husband,\\nwhen he came in to see her at eleven o’clock before going out. “I know\\nyou are dining at the club; papa put down your name. But what are you\\ngoing to do in the morning?”\\n\\n“I am only going to Katavasov,” answered Levin.\\n\\n“Why so early?”\\n\\n“He promised to introduce me to Metrov. I wanted to talk to him about\\nmy work. He’s a distinguished scientific man from Petersburg,” said\\nLevin.\\n\\n“Yes; wasn’t it his article you were praising so? Well, and after\\nthat?” said Kitty.\\n\\n“I shall go to the court, perhaps, about my sister’s business.”\\n\\n“And the concert?” she queried.\\n\\n“I shan’t go there all alone.”\\n\\n“No? do go; there are going to be some new things.... That interested\\nyou so. I should certainly go.”\\n\\n“Well, anyway, I shall come home before dinner,” he said, looking at\\nhis watch.\\n\\n“Put on your frock coat, so that you can go straight to call on\\nCountess Bola.”\\n\\n“But is it absolutely necessary?”\\n\\n“Oh, absolutely! He has been to see us. Come, what is it? You go in,\\nsit down, talk for five minutes of the weather, get up and go away.”\\n\\n“Oh, you wouldn’t believe it! I’ve got so out of the way of all this\\nthat it makes me feel positively ashamed. It’s such a horrible thing to\\ndo! A complete outsider walks in, sits down, stays on with nothing to\\ndo, wastes their time and worries himself, and walks away!”\\n\\nKitty laughed.\\n\\n“Why, I suppose you used to pay calls before you were married, didn’t\\nyou?”\\n\\n“Yes, I did, but I always felt ashamed, and now I’m so out of the way\\nof it that, by Jove! I’d sooner go two days running without my dinner\\nthan pay this call! One’s so ashamed! I feel all the while that they’re\\nannoyed, that they’re saying, ‘What has he come for?’”\\n\\n“No, they won’t. I’ll answer for that,” said Kitty, looking into his\\nface with a laugh. She took his hand. “Well, good-bye.... Do go,\\nplease.”\\n\\nHe was just going out after kissing his wife’s hand, when she stopped\\nhim.\\n\\n“Kostya, do you know I’ve only fifty roubles left?”\\n\\n“Oh, all right, I’ll go to the bank and get some. How much?” he said,\\nwith the expression of dissatisfaction she knew so well.\\n\\n“No, wait a minute.” She held his hand. “Let’s talk about it, it\\nworries me. I seem to spend nothing unnecessary, but money seems to fly\\naway simply. We don’t manage well, somehow.”\\n\\n“Oh, it’s all right,” he said with a little cough, looking at her from\\nunder his brows.\\n\\nThat cough she knew well. It was a sign of intense dissatisfaction, not\\nwith her, but with himself. He certainly was displeased not at so much\\nmoney being spent, but at being reminded of what he, knowing something\\nwas unsatisfactory, wanted to forget.\\n\\n“I have told Sokolov to sell the wheat, and to borrow an advance on the\\nmill. We shall have money enough in any case.”\\n\\n“Yes, but I’m afraid that altogether....”\\n\\n“Oh, it’s all right, all right,” he repeated. “Well, good-bye,\\ndarling.”\\n\\n“No, I’m really sorry sometimes that I listened to mamma. How nice it\\nwould have been in the country! As it is, I’m worrying you all, and\\nwe’re wasting our money.”\\n\\n“Not at all, not at all. Not once since I’ve been married have I said\\nthat things could have been better than they are....”\\n\\n“Truly?” she said, looking into his eyes.\\n\\nHe had said it without thinking, simply to console her. But when he\\nglanced at her and saw those sweet truthful eyes fastened questioningly\\non him, he repeated it with his whole heart. “I was positively\\nforgetting her,” he thought. And he remembered what was before them, so\\nsoon to come.\\n\\n“Will it be soon? How do you feel?” he whispered, taking her two hands.\\n\\n“I have so often thought so, that now I don’t think about it or know\\nanything about it.”\\n\\n“And you’re not frightened?”\\n\\nShe smiled contemptuously.\\n\\n“Not the least little bit,” she said.\\n\\n“Well, if anything happens, I shall be at Katavasov’s.”\\n\\n“No, nothing will happen, and don’t think about it. I’m going for a\\nwalk on the boulevard with papa. We’re going to see Dolly. I shall\\nexpect you before dinner. Oh, yes! Do you know that Dolly’s position is\\nbecoming utterly impossible? She’s in debt all round; she hasn’t a\\npenny. We were talking yesterday with mamma and Arseny” (this was her\\nsister’s husband Lvov), “and we determined to send you with him to talk\\nto Stiva. It’s really unbearable. One can’t speak to papa about it....\\nBut if you and he....”\\n\\n“Why, what can we do?” said Levin.\\n\\n“You’ll be at Arseny’s, anyway; talk to him, he will tell what we\\ndecided.”\\n\\n“Oh, I agree to everything Arseny thinks beforehand. I’ll go and see\\nhim. By the way, if I do go to the concert, I’ll go with Natalia. Well,\\ngood-bye.”\\n\\nOn the steps Levin was stopped by his old servant Kouzma, who had been\\nwith him before his marriage, and now looked after their household in\\ntown.\\n\\n“Beauty” (that was the left shaft-horse brought up from the country)\\n“has been badly shod and is quite lame,” he said. “What does your honor\\nwish to be done?”\\n\\nDuring the first part of their stay in Moscow, Levin had used his own\\nhorses brought up from the country. He had tried to arrange this part\\nof their expenses in the best and cheapest way possible; but it\\nappeared that their own horses came dearer than hired horses, and they\\nstill hired too.\\n\\n“Send for the veterinary, there may be a bruise.”\\n\\n“And for Katerina Alexandrovna?” asked Kouzma.\\n\\nLevin was not by now struck as he had been at first by the fact that to\\nget from one end of Moscow to the other he had to have two powerful\\nhorses put into a heavy carriage, to take the carriage three miles\\nthrough the snowy slush and to keep it standing there four hours,\\npaying five roubles every time.\\n\\nNow it seemed quite natural.\\n\\n“Hire a pair for our carriage from the jobmaster,” said he.\\n\\n“Yes, sir.”\\n\\nAnd so, simply and easily, thanks to the facilities of town life, Levin\\nsettled a question which, in the country, would have called for so much\\npersonal trouble and exertion, and going out onto the steps, he called\\na sledge, sat down, and drove to Nikitsky. On the way he thought no\\nmore of money, but mused on the introduction that awaited him to the\\nPetersburg savant, a writer on sociology, and what he would say to him\\nabout his book.\\n\\nOnly during the first days of his stay in Moscow Levin had been struck\\nby the expenditure, strange to one living in the country, unproductive\\nbut inevitable, that was expected of him on every side. But by now he\\nhad grown used to it. That had happened to him in this matter which is\\nsaid to happen to drunkards—the first glass sticks in the throat, the\\nsecond flies down like a hawk, but after the third they’re like tiny\\nlittle birds. When Levin had changed his first hundred-rouble note to\\npay for liveries for his footmen and hall-porter he could not help\\nreflecting that these liveries were of no use to anyone—but they were\\nindubitably necessary, to judge by the amazement of the princess and\\nKitty when he suggested that they might do without liveries,—that these\\nliveries would cost the wages of two laborers for the summer, that is,\\nwould pay for about three hundred working days from Easter to Ash\\nWednesday, and each a day of hard work from early morning to late\\nevening—and that hundred-rouble note did stick in his throat. But the\\nnext note, changed to pay for providing a dinner for their relations,\\nthat cost twenty-eight roubles, though it did excite in Levin the\\nreflection that twenty-eight roubles meant nine measures of oats, which\\nmen would with groans and sweat have reaped and bound and thrashed and\\nwinnowed and sifted and sown,—this next one he parted with more easily.\\nAnd now the notes he changed no longer aroused such reflections, and\\nthey flew off like little birds. Whether the labor devoted to obtaining\\nthe money corresponded to the pleasure given by what was bought with\\nit, was a consideration he had long ago dismissed. His business\\ncalculation that there was a certain price below which he could not\\nsell certain grain was forgotten too. The rye, for the price of which\\nhe had so long held out, had been sold for fifty kopecks a measure\\ncheaper than it had been fetching a month ago. Even the consideration\\nthat with such an expenditure he could not go on living for a year\\nwithout debt, that even had no force. Only one thing was essential: to\\nhave money in the bank, without inquiring where it came from, so as to\\nknow that one had the wherewithal to buy meat for tomorrow. And this\\ncondition had hitherto been fulfilled; he had always had the money in\\nthe bank. But now the money in the bank had gone, and he could not\\nquite tell where to get the next installment. And this it was which, at\\nthe moment when Kitty had mentioned money, had disturbed him; but he\\nhad no time to think about it. He drove off, thinking of Katavasov and\\nthe meeting with Metrov that was before him 3\\n\\nLevin had on this visit to town seen a great deal of his old friend at\\nthe university, Professor Katavasov, whom he had not seen since his\\nmarriage. He liked in Katavasov the clearness and simplicity of his\\nconception of life. Levin thought that the clearness of Katavasov’s\\nconception of life was due to the poverty of his nature; Katavasov\\nthought that the disconnectedness of Levin’s ideas was due to his lack\\nof intellectual discipline; but Levin enjoyed Katavasov’s clearness,\\nand Katavasov enjoyed the abundance of Levin’s untrained ideas, and\\nthey liked to meet and to discuss.\\n\\nLevin had read Katavasov some parts of his book, and he had liked them.\\nOn the previous day Katavasov had met Levin at a public lecture and\\ntold him that the celebrated Metrov, whose article Levin had so much\\nliked, was in Moscow, that he had been much interested by what\\nKatavasov had told him about Levin’s work, and that he was coming to\\nsee him tomorrow at eleven, and would be very glad to make Levin’s\\nacquaintance.\\n\\n“You’re positively a reformed character, I’m glad to see,” said\\nKatavasov, meeting Levin in the little drawing-room. “I heard the bell\\nand thought: Impossible that it can be he at the exact time!... Well,\\nwhat do you say to the Montenegrins now? They’re a race of warriors.”\\n\\n“Why, what’s happened?” asked Levin.\\n\\nKatavasov in a few words told him the last piece of news from the war,\\nand going into his study, introduced Levin to a short, thick-set man of\\npleasant appearance. This was Metrov. The conversation touched for a\\nbrief space on politics and on how recent events were looked at in the\\nhigher spheres in Petersburg. Metrov repeated a saying that had reached\\nhim through a most trustworthy source, reported as having been uttered\\non this subject by the Tsar and one of the ministers. Katavasov had\\nheard also on excellent authority that the Tsar had said something\\nquite different. Levin tried to imagine circumstances in which both\\nsayings might have been uttered, and the conversation on that topic\\ndropped.\\n\\n“Yes, here he’s written almost a book on the natural conditions of the\\nlaborer in relation to the land,” said Katavasov; “I’m not a\\nspecialist, but I, as a natural science man, was pleased at his not\\ntaking mankind as something outside biological laws; but, on the\\ncontrary, seeing his dependence on his surroundings, and in that\\ndependence seeking the laws of his development.”\\n\\n“That’s very interesting,” said Metrov.\\n\\n“What I began precisely was to write a book on agriculture; but\\nstudying the chief instrument of agriculture, the laborer,” said Levin,\\nreddening, “I could not help coming to quite unexpected results.”\\n\\nAnd Levin began carefully, as it were, feeling his ground, to expound\\nhis views. He knew Metrov had written an article against the generally\\naccepted theory of political economy, but to what extent he could\\nreckon on his sympathy with his own new views he did not know and could\\nnot guess from the clever and serene face of the learned man.\\n\\n“But in what do you see the special characteristics of the Russian\\nlaborer?” said Metrov; “in his biological characteristics, so to speak,\\nor in the condition in which he is placed?”\\n\\nLevin saw that there was an idea underlying this question with which he\\ndid not agree. But he went on explaining his own idea that the Russian\\nlaborer has a quite special view of the land, different from that of\\nother people; and to support this proposition he made haste to add that\\nin his opinion this attitude of the Russian peasant was due to the\\nconsciousness of his vocation to people vast unoccupied expanses in the\\nEast.\\n\\n“One may easily be led into error in basing any conclusion on the\\ngeneral vocation of a people,” said Metrov, interrupting Levin. “The\\ncondition of the laborer will always depend on his relation to the land\\nand to capital.”\\n\\nAnd without letting Levin finish explaining his idea, Metrov began\\nexpounding to him the special point of his own theory.\\n\\nIn what the point of his theory lay, Levin did not understand, because\\nhe did not take the trouble to understand. He saw that Metrov, like\\nother people, in spite of his own article, in which he had attacked the\\ncurrent theory of political economy, looked at the position of the\\nRussian peasant simply from the point of view of capital, wages, and\\nrent. He would indeed have been obliged to admit that in the\\neastern—much the larger—part of Russia rent was as yet nil, that for\\nnine-tenths of the eighty millions of the Russian peasants wages took\\nthe form simply of food provided for themselves, and that capital does\\nnot so far exist except in the form of the most primitive tools. Yet it\\nwas only from that point of view that he considered every laborer,\\nthough in many points he differed from the economists and had his own\\ntheory of the wage-fund, which he expounded to Levin.\\n\\nLevin listened reluctantly, and at first made objections. He would have\\nliked to interrupt Metrov, to explain his own thought, which in his\\nopinion would have rendered further exposition of Metrov’s theories\\nsuperfluous. But later on, feeling convinced that they looked at the\\nmatter so differently, that they could never understand one another, he\\ndid not even oppose his statements, but simply listened. Although what\\nMetrov was saying was by now utterly devoid of interest for him, he yet\\nexperienced a certain satisfaction in listening to him. It flattered\\nhis vanity that such a learned man should explain his ideas to him so\\neagerly, with such intensity and confidence in Levin’s understanding of\\nthe subject, sometimes with a mere hint referring him to a whole aspect\\nof the subject. He put this down to his own credit, unaware that\\nMetrov, who had already discussed his theory over and over again with\\nall his intimate friends, talked of it with special eagerness to every\\nnew person, and in general was eager to talk to anyone of any subject\\nthat interested him, even if still obscure to himself.\\n\\n“We are late though,” said Katavasov, looking at his watch directly\\nMetrov had finished his discourse.\\n\\n“Yes, there’s a meeting of the Society of Amateurs today in\\ncommemoration of the jubilee of Svintitch,” said Katavasov in answer to\\nLevin’s inquiry. “Pyotr Ivanovitch and I were going. I’ve promised to\\ndeliver an address on his labors in zoology. Come along with us, it’s\\nvery interesting.”\\n\\n“Yes, and indeed it’s time to start,” said Metrov. “Come with us, and\\nfrom there, if you care to, come to my place. I should very much like\\nto hear your work.”\\n\\n“Oh, no! It’s no good yet, it’s unfinished. But I shall be very glad to\\ngo to the meeting.”\\n\\n“I say, friends, have you heard? He has handed in the separate report,”\\nKatavasov called from the other room, where he was putting on his frock\\ncoat.\\n\\nAnd a conversation sprang up upon the university question, which was a\\nvery important event that winter in Moscow. Three old professors in the\\ncouncil had not accepted the opinion of the younger professors. The\\nyoung ones had registered a separate resolution. This, in the judgment\\nof some people, was monstrous, in the judgment of others it was the\\nsimplest and most just thing to do, and the professors were split up\\ninto two parties.\\n\\nOne party, to which Katavasov belonged, saw in the opposite party a\\nscoundrelly betrayal and treachery, while the opposite party saw in\\nthem childishness and lack of respect for the authorities. Levin,\\nthough he did not belong to the university, had several times already\\nduring his stay in Moscow heard and talked about this matter, and had\\nhis own opinion on the subject. He took part in the conversation that\\nwas continued in the street, as they all three walked to the buildings\\nof the old university.\\n\\nThe meeting had already begun. Round the cloth-covered table, at which\\nKatavasov and Metrov seated themselves, there were some half-dozen\\npersons, and one of these was bending close over a manuscript, reading\\nsomething aloud. Levin sat down in one of the empty chairs that were\\nstanding round the table, and in a whisper asked a student sitting near\\nwhat was being read. The student, eyeing Levin with displeasure, said:\\n\\n“Biography.”\\n\\nThough Levin was not interested in the biography, he could not help\\nlistening, and learned some new and interesting facts about the life of\\nthe distinguished man of science.\\n\\nWhen the reader had finished, the chairman thanked him and read some\\nverses of the poet Ment sent him on the jubilee, and said a few words\\nby way of thanks to the poet. Then Katavasov in his loud, ringing voice\\nread his address on the scientific labors of the man whose jubilee was\\nbeing kept.\\n\\nWhen Katavasov had finished, Levin looked at his watch, saw it was past\\none, and thought that there would not be time before the concert to\\nread Metrov his book, and indeed, he did not now care to do so. During\\nthe reading he had thought over their conversation. He saw distinctly\\nnow that though Metrov’s ideas might perhaps have value, his own ideas\\nhad a value too, and their ideas could only be made clear and lead to\\nsomething if each worked separately in his chosen path, and that\\nnothing would be gained by putting their ideas together. And having\\nmade up his mind to refuse Metrov’s invitation, Levin went up to him at\\nthe end of the meeting. Metrov introduced Levin to the chairman, with\\nwhom he was talking of the political news. Metrov told the chairman\\nwhat he had already told Levin, and Levin made the same remarks on his\\nnews that he had already made that morning, but for the sake of variety\\nhe expressed also a new opinion which had only just struck him. After\\nthat the conversation turned again on the university question. As Levin\\nhad already heard it all, he made haste to tell Metrov that he was\\nsorry he could not take advantage of his invitation, took leave, and\\ndrove to Lvov’s 4\\n\\nLvov, the husband of Natalia, Kitty’s sister, had spent all his life in\\nforeign capitals, where he had been educated, and had been in the\\ndiplomatic service.\\n\\nDuring the previous year he had left the diplomatic service, not owing\\nto any “unpleasantness” (he never had any “unpleasantness” with\\nanyone), and was transferred to the department of the court of the\\npalace in Moscow, in order to give his two boys the best education\\npossible.\\n\\nIn spite of the striking contrast in their habits and views and the\\nfact that Lvov was older than Levin, they had seen a great deal of one\\nanother that winter, and had taken a great liking to each other.\\n\\nLvov was at home, and Levin went in to him unannounced.\\n\\nLvov, in a house coat with a belt and in chamois leather shoes, was\\nsitting in an armchair, and with a pince-nez with blue glasses he was\\nreading a book that stood on a reading desk, while in his beautiful\\nhand he held a half-burned cigarette daintily away from him.\\n\\nHis handsome, delicate, and still youthful-looking face, to which his\\ncurly, glistening silvery hair gave a still more aristocratic air,\\nlighted up with a smile when he saw Levin.\\n\\n“Capital! I was meaning to send to you. How’s Kitty? Sit here, it’s\\nmore comfortable.” He got up and pushed up a rocking chair. “Have you\\nread the last circular in the _Journal de St. Pétersbourg?_ I think\\nit’s excellent,” he said, with a slight French accent.\\n\\nLevin told him what he had heard from Katavasov was being said in\\nPetersburg, and after talking a little about politics, he told him of\\nhis interview with Metrov, and the learned society’s meeting. To Lvov\\nit was very interesting.\\n\\n“That’s what I envy you, that you are able to mix in these interesting\\nscientific circles,” he said. And as he talked, he passed as usual into\\nFrench, which was easier to him. “It’s true I haven’t the time for it.\\nMy official work and the children leave me no time; and then I’m not\\nashamed to own that my education has been too defective.”\\n\\n“That I don’t believe,” said Levin with a smile, feeling, as he always\\ndid, touched at Lvov’s low opinion of himself, which was not in the\\nleast put on from a desire to seem or to be modest, but was absolutely\\nsincere.\\n\\n“Oh, yes, indeed! I feel now how badly educated I am. To educate my\\nchildren I positively have to look up a great deal, and in fact simply\\nto study myself. For it’s not enough to have teachers, there must be\\nsomeone to look after them, just as on your land you want laborers and\\nan overseer. See what I’m reading”—he pointed to Buslaev’s _Grammar_ on\\nthe desk—“it’s expected of Misha, and it’s so difficult.... Come,\\nexplain to me.... Here he says....”\\n\\nLevin tried to explain to him that it couldn’t be understood, but that\\nit had to be taught; but Lvov would not agree with him.\\n\\n“Oh, you’re laughing at it!”\\n\\n“On the contrary, you can’t imagine how, when I look at you, I’m always\\nlearning the task that lies before me, that is the education of one’s\\nchildren.”\\n\\n“Well, there’s nothing for you to learn,” said Lvov.\\n\\n“All I know,” said Levin, “is that I have never seen better brought-up\\nchildren than yours, and I wouldn’t wish for children better than\\nyours.”\\n\\nLvov visibly tried to restrain the expression of his delight, but he\\nwas positively radiant with smiles.\\n\\n“If only they’re better than I! That’s all I desire. You don’t know yet\\nall the work,” he said, “with boys who’ve been left like mine to run\\nwild abroad.”\\n\\n“You’ll catch all that up. They’re such clever children. The great\\nthing is the education of character. That’s what I learn when I look at\\nyour children.”\\n\\n“You talk of the education of character. You can’t imagine how\\ndifficult that is! You have hardly succeeded in combating one tendency\\nwhen others crop up, and the struggle begins again. If one had not a\\nsupport in religion—you remember we talked about that—no father could\\nbring children up relying on his own strength alone without that help.”\\n\\nThis subject, which always interested Levin, was cut short by the\\nentrance of the beauty Natalia Alexandrovna, dressed to go out.\\n\\n“I didn’t know you were here,” she said, unmistakably feeling no\\nregret, but a positive pleasure, in interrupting this conversation on a\\ntopic she had heard so much of that she was by now weary of it. “Well,\\nhow is Kitty? I am dining with you today. I tell you what, Arseny,” she\\nturned to her husband, “you take the carriage.”\\n\\nAnd the husband and wife began to discuss their arrangements for the\\nday. As the husband had to drive to meet someone on official business,\\nwhile the wife had to go to the concert and some public meeting of a\\ncommittee on the Eastern Question, there was a great deal to consider\\nand settle. Levin had to take part in their plans as one of themselves.\\nIt was settled that Levin should go with Natalia to the concert and the\\nmeeting, and that from there they should send the carriage to the\\noffice for Arseny, and he should call for her and take her to Kitty’s;\\nor that, if he had not finished his work, he should send the carriage\\nback and Levin would go with her.\\n\\n“He’s spoiling me,” Lvov said to his wife; “he assures me that our\\nchildren are splendid, when I know how much that’s bad there is in\\nthem.”\\n\\n“Arseny goes to extremes, I always say,” said his wife. “If you look\\nfor perfection, you will never be satisfied. And it’s true, as papa\\nsays,—that when we were brought up there was one extreme—we were kept\\nin the basement, while our parents lived in the best rooms; now it’s\\njust the other way—the parents are in the wash house, while the\\nchildren are in the best rooms. Parents now are not expected to live at\\nall, but to exist altogether for their children.”\\n\\n“Well, what if they like it better?” Lvov said, with his beautiful\\nsmile, touching her hand. “Anyone who didn’t know you would think you\\nwere a stepmother, not a true mother.”\\n\\n“No, extremes are not good in anything,” Natalia said serenely, putting\\nhis paper-knife straight in its proper place on the table.\\n\\n“Well, come here, you perfect children,” Lvov said to the two handsome\\nboys who came in, and after bowing to Levin, went up to their father,\\nobviously wishing to ask him about something.\\n\\nLevin would have liked to talk to them, to hear what they would say to\\ntheir father, but Natalia began talking to him, and then Lvov’s\\ncolleague in the service, Mahotin, walked in, wearing his court\\nuniform, to go with him to meet someone, and a conversation was kept up\\nwithout a break upon Herzegovina, Princess Korzinskaya, the town\\ncouncil, and the sudden death of Madame Apraksina.\\n\\nLevin even forgot the commission intrusted to him. He recollected it as\\nhe was going into the hall.\\n\\n“Oh, Kitty told me to talk to you about Oblonsky,” he said, as Lvov was\\nstanding on the stairs, seeing his wife and Levin off.\\n\\n“Yes, yes, maman wants us, _les beaux-frères,_ to attack him,” he said,\\nblushing. “But why should I?”\\n\\n“Well, then, I will attack him,” said Madame Lvova, with a smile,\\nstanding in her white sheepskin cape, waiting till they had finished\\nspeaking. “Come, let us go 5\\n\\nAt the concert in the afternoon two very interesting things were\\nperformed. One was a fantasia, _King Lear;_ the other was a quartette\\ndedicated to the memory of Bach. Both were new and in the new style,\\nand Levin was eager to form an opinion of them. After escorting his\\nsister-in-law to her stall, he stood against a column and tried to\\nlisten as attentively and conscientiously as possible. He tried not to\\nlet his attention be distracted, and not to spoil his impression by\\nlooking at the conductor in a white tie, waving his arms, which always\\ndisturbed his enjoyment of music so much, or the ladies in bonnets,\\nwith strings carefully tied over their ears, and all these people\\neither thinking of nothing at all or thinking of all sorts of things\\nexcept the music. He tried to avoid meeting musical connoisseurs or\\ntalkative acquaintances, and stood looking at the floor straight before\\nhim, listening.\\n\\nBut the more he listened to the fantasia of _King Lear_ the further he\\nfelt from forming any definite opinion of it. There was, as it were, a\\ncontinual beginning, a preparation of the musical expression of some\\nfeeling, but it fell to pieces again directly, breaking into new\\nmusical motives, or simply nothing but the whims of the composer,\\nexceedingly complex but disconnected sounds. And these fragmentary\\nmusical expressions, though sometimes beautiful, were disagreeable,\\nbecause they were utterly unexpected and not led up to by anything.\\nGaiety and grief and despair and tenderness and triumph followed one\\nanother without any connection, like the emotions of a madman. And\\nthose emotions, like a madman’s, sprang up quite unexpectedly.\\n\\nDuring the whole of the performance Levin felt like a deaf man watching\\npeople dancing, and was in a state of complete bewilderment when the\\nfantasia was over, and felt a great weariness from the fruitless strain\\non his attention. Loud applause resounded on all sides. Everyone got\\nup, moved about, and began talking. Anxious to throw some light on his\\nown perplexity from the impressions of others, Levin began to walk\\nabout, looking for connoisseurs, and was glad to see a well-known\\nmusical amateur in conversation with Pestsov, whom he knew.\\n\\n“Marvelous!” Pestsov was saying in his mellow bass. “How are you,\\nKonstantin Dmitrievitch? Particularly sculpturesque and plastic, so to\\nsay, and richly colored is that passage where you feel Cordelia’s\\napproach, where woman, _das ewig Weibliche,_ enters into conflict with\\nfate. Isn’t it?”\\n\\n“You mean ... what has Cordelia to do with it?” Levin asked timidly,\\nforgetting that the fantasia was supposed to represent King Lear.\\n\\n“Cordelia comes in ... see here!” said Pestsov, tapping his finger on\\nthe satiny surface of the program he held in his hand and passing it to\\nLevin.\\n\\nOnly then Levin recollected the title of the fantasia, and made haste\\nto read in the Russian translation the lines from Shakespeare that were\\nprinted on the back of the program.\\n\\n“You can’t follow it without that,” said Pestsov, addressing Levin, as\\nthe person he had been speaking to had gone away, and he had no one to\\ntalk to.\\n\\nIn the _entr’acte_ Levin and Pestsov fell into an argument upon the\\nmerits and defects of music of the Wagner school. Levin maintained that\\nthe mistake of Wagner and all his followers lay in their trying to take\\nmusic into the sphere of another art, just as poetry goes wrong when it\\ntries to paint a face as the art of painting ought to do, and as an\\ninstance of this mistake he cited the sculptor who carved in marble\\ncertain poetic phantasms flitting round the figure of the poet on the\\npedestal. “These phantoms were so far from being phantoms that they\\nwere positively clinging on the ladder,” said Levin. The comparison\\npleased him, but he could not remember whether he had not used the same\\nphrase before, and to Pestsov, too, and as he said it he felt confused.\\n\\nPestsov maintained that art is one, and that it can attain its highest\\nmanifestations only by conjunction with all kinds of art.\\n\\nThe second piece that was performed Levin could not hear. Pestsov, who\\nwas standing beside him, was talking to him almost all the time,\\ncondemning the music for its excessive affected assumption of\\nsimplicity, and comparing it with the simplicity of the Pre-Raphaelites\\nin painting. As he went out Levin met many more acquaintances, with\\nwhom he talked of politics, of music, and of common acquaintances.\\nAmong others he met Count Bol, whom he had utterly forgotten to call\\nupon.\\n\\n“Well, go at once then,” Madame Lvova said, when he told her; “perhaps\\nthey’ll not be at home, and then you can come to the meeting to fetch\\nme. You’ll find me still there 6\\n\\n“Perhaps they’re not at home?” said Levin, as he went into the hall of\\nCountess Bola’s house.\\n\\n“At home; please walk in,” said the porter, resolutely removing his\\novercoat.\\n\\n“How annoying!” thought Levin with a sigh, taking off one glove and\\nstroking his hat. “What did I come for? What have I to say to them?”\\n\\nAs he passed through the first drawing-room Levin met in the doorway\\nCountess Bola, giving some order to a servant with a care-worn and\\nsevere face. On seeing Levin she smiled, and asked him to come into the\\nlittle drawing-room, where he heard voices. In this room there were\\nsitting in armchairs the two daughters of the countess, and a Moscow\\ncolonel, whom Levin knew. Levin went up, greeted them, and sat down\\nbeside the sofa with his hat on his knees.\\n\\n“How is your wife? Have you been at the concert? We couldn’t go. Mamma\\nhad to be at the funeral service.”\\n\\n“Yes, I heard.... What a sudden death!” said Levin.\\n\\nThe countess came in, sat down on the sofa, and she too asked after his\\nwife and inquired about the concert.\\n\\nLevin answered, and repeated an inquiry about Madame Apraksina’s sudden\\ndeath.\\n\\n“But she was always in weak health.”\\n\\n“Were you at the opera yesterday?”\\n\\n“Yes, I was.”\\n\\n“Lucca was very good.”\\n\\n“Yes, very good,” he said, and as it was utterly of no consequence to\\nhim what they thought of him, he began repeating what they had heard a\\nhundred times about the characteristics of the singer’s talent.\\nCountess Bola pretended to be listening. Then, when he had said enough\\nand paused, the colonel, who had been silent till then, began to talk.\\nThe colonel too talked of the opera, and about culture. At last, after\\nspeaking of the proposed _folle journée_ at Turin’s, the colonel\\nlaughed, got up noisily, and went away. Levin too rose, but he saw by\\nthe face of the countess that it was not yet time for him to go. He\\nmust stay two minutes longer. He sat down.\\n\\nBut as he was thinking all the while how stupid it was, he could not\\nfind a subject for conversation, and sat silent.\\n\\n“You are not going to the public meeting? They say it will be very\\ninteresting,” began the countess.\\n\\n“No, I promised my _belle-sœur_ to fetch her from it,” said Levin.\\n\\nA silence followed. The mother once more exchanged glances with a\\ndaughter.\\n\\n“Well, now I think the time has come,” thought Levin, and he got up.\\nThe ladies shook hands with him, and begged him to say _mille choses_\\nto his wife for them.\\n\\nThe porter asked him, as he gave him his coat, “Where is your honor\\nstaying?” and immediately wrote down his address in a big handsomely\\nbound book.\\n\\n“Of course I don’t care, but still I feel ashamed and awfully stupid,”\\nthought Levin, consoling himself with the reflection that everyone does\\nit. He drove to the public meeting, where he was to find his\\nsister-in-law, so as to drive home with her.\\n\\nAt the public meeting of the committee there were a great many people,\\nand almost all the highest society. Levin was in time for the report\\nwhich, as everyone said, was very interesting. When the reading of the\\nreport was over, people moved about, and Levin met Sviazhsky, who\\ninvited him very pressingly to come that evening to a meeting of the\\nSociety of Agriculture, where a celebrated lecture was to be delivered,\\nand Stepan Arkadyevitch, who had only just come from the races, and\\nmany other acquaintances; and Levin heard and uttered various\\ncriticisms on the meeting, on the new fantasia, and on a public trial.\\nBut, probably from the mental fatigue he was beginning to feel, he made\\na blunder in speaking of the trial, and this blunder he recalled\\nseveral times with vexation. Speaking of the sentence upon a foreigner\\nwho had been condemned in Russia, and of how unfair it would be to\\npunish him by exile abroad, Levin repeated what he had heard the day\\nbefore in conversation from an acquaintance.\\n\\n“I think sending him abroad is much the same as punishing a carp by\\nputting it into the water,” said Levin. Then he recollected that this\\nidea, which he had heard from an acquaintance and uttered as his own,\\ncame from a fable of Krilov’s, and that the acquaintance had picked it\\nup from a newspaper article.\\n\\nAfter driving home with his sister-in-law, and finding Kitty in good\\nspirits and quite well, Levin drove to the club 7\\n\\nLevin reached the club just at the right time. Members and visitors\\nwere driving up as he arrived. Levin had not been at the club for a\\nvery long while—not since he lived in Moscow, when he was leaving the\\nuniversity and going into society. He remembered the club, the external\\ndetails of its arrangement, but he had completely forgotten the\\nimpression it had made on him in old days. But as soon as, driving into\\nthe wide semicircular court and getting out of the sledge, he mounted\\nthe steps, and the hall-porter, adorned with a crossway scarf,\\nnoiselessly opened the door to him with a bow; as soon as he saw in the\\nporter’s room the cloaks and galoshes of members who thought it less\\ntrouble to take them off downstairs; as soon as he heard the mysterious\\nringing bell that preceded him as he ascended the easy, carpeted\\nstaircase, and saw the statue on the landing, and the third porter at\\nthe top doors, a familiar figure grown older, in the club livery,\\nopening the door without haste or delay, and scanning the visitors as\\nthey passed in—Levin felt the old impression of the club come back in a\\nrush, an impression of repose, comfort, and propriety.\\n\\n“Your hat, please,” the porter said to Levin, who forgot the club rule\\nto leave his hat in the porter’s room. “Long time since you’ve been.\\nThe prince put your name down yesterday. Prince Stepan Arkadyevitch is\\nnot here yet.”\\n\\nThe porter did not only know Levin, but also all his ties and\\nrelationships, and so immediately mentioned his intimate friends.\\n\\nPassing through the outer hall, divided up by screens, and the room\\npartitioned on the right, where a man sits at the fruit buffet, Levin\\novertook an old man walking slowly in, and entered the dining-room full\\nof noise and people.\\n\\nHe walked along the tables, almost all full, and looked at the\\nvisitors. He saw people of all sorts, old and young; some he knew a\\nlittle, some intimate friends. There was not a single cross or\\nworried-looking face. All seemed to have left their cares and anxieties\\nin the porter’s room with their hats, and were all deliberately getting\\nready to enjoy the material blessings of life. Sviazhsky was here and\\nShtcherbatsky, Nevyedovsky and the old prince, and Vronsky and Sergey\\nIvanovitch.\\n\\n“Ah! why are you late?” the prince said smiling, and giving him his\\nhand over his own shoulder. “How’s Kitty?” he added, smoothing out the\\nnapkin he had tucked in at his waistcoat buttons.\\n\\n“All right; they are dining at home, all the three of them.”\\n\\n“Ah, ‘Aline-Nadine,’ to be sure! There’s no room with us. Go to that\\ntable, and make haste and take a seat,” said the prince, and turning\\naway he carefully took a plate of eel soup.\\n\\n“Levin, this way!” a good-natured voice shouted a little farther on. It\\nwas Turovtsin. He was sitting with a young officer, and beside them\\nwere two chairs turned upside down. Levin gladly went up to them. He\\nhad always liked the good-hearted rake, Turovtsin—he was associated in\\nhis mind with memories of his courtship—and at that moment, after the\\nstrain of intellectual conversation, the sight of Turovtsin’s\\ngood-natured face was particularly welcome.\\n\\n“For you and Oblonsky. He’ll be here directly.”\\n\\nThe young man, holding himself very erect, with eyes forever twinkling\\nwith enjoyment, was an officer from Petersburg, Gagin. Turovtsin\\nintroduced them.\\n\\n“Oblonsky’s always late.”\\n\\n“Ah, here he is!”\\n\\n“Have you only just come?” said Oblonsky, coming quickly towards them.\\n“Good day. Had some vodka? Well, come along then.”\\n\\nLevin got up and went with him to the big table spread with spirits and\\nappetizers of the most various kinds. One would have thought that out\\nof two dozen delicacies one might find something to one’s taste, but\\nStepan Arkadyevitch asked for something special, and one of the\\nliveried waiters standing by immediately brought what was required.\\nThey drank a wine-glassful and returned to their table.\\n\\nAt once, while they were still at the soup, Gagin was served with\\nchampagne, and told the waiter to fill four glasses. Levin did not\\nrefuse the wine, and asked for a second bottle. He was very hungry, and\\nate and drank with great enjoyment, and with still greater enjoyment\\ntook part in the lively and simple conversation of his companions.\\nGagin, dropping his voice, told the last good story from Petersburg,\\nand the story, though improper and stupid, was so ludicrous that Levin\\nbroke into roars of laughter so loud that those near looked round.\\n\\n“That’s in the same style as, ‘that’s a thing I can’t endure!’ You know\\nthe story?” said Stepan Arkadyevitch. “Ah, that’s exquisite! Another\\nbottle,” he said to the waiter, and he began to relate his good story.\\n\\n“Pyotr Illyitch Vinovsky invites you to drink with him,” a little old\\nwaiter interrupted Stepan Arkadyevitch, bringing two delicate glasses\\nof sparkling champagne, and addressing Stepan Arkadyevitch and Levin.\\nStepan Arkadyevitch took the glass, and looking towards a bald man with\\nred mustaches at the other end of the table, he nodded to him, smiling.\\n\\n“Who’s that?” asked Levin.\\n\\n“You met him once at my place, don’t you remember? A good-natured\\nfellow.”\\n\\nLevin did the same as Stepan Arkadyevitch and took the glass.\\n\\nStepan Arkadyevitch’s anecdote too was very amusing. Levin told his\\nstory, and that too was successful. Then they talked of horses, of the\\nraces, of what they had been doing that day, and of how smartly\\nVronsky’s Atlas had won the first prize. Levin did not notice how the\\ntime passed at dinner.\\n\\n“Ah! and here they are!” Stepan Arkadyevitch said towards the end of\\ndinner, leaning over the back of his chair and holding out his hand to\\nVronsky, who came up with a tall officer of the Guards. Vronsky’s face\\ntoo beamed with the look of good-humored enjoyment that was general in\\nthe club. He propped his elbow playfully on Stepan Arkadyevitch’s\\nshoulder, whispering something to him, and he held out his hand to\\nLevin with the same good-humored smile.\\n\\n“Very glad to meet you,” he said. “I looked out for you at the\\nelection, but I was told you had gone away.”\\n\\n“Yes, I left the same day. We’ve just been talking of your horse. I\\ncongratulate you,” said Levin. “It was very rapidly run.”\\n\\n“Yes; you’ve race horses too, haven’t you?”\\n\\n“No, my father had; but I remember and know something about it.”\\n\\n“Where have you dined?” asked Stepan Arkadyevitch.\\n\\n“We were at the second table, behind the columns.”\\n\\n“We’ve been celebrating his success,” said the tall colonel. “It’s his\\nsecond Imperial prize. I wish I might have the luck at cards he has\\nwith horses. Well, why waste the precious time? I’m going to the\\n‘infernal regions,’” added the colonel, and he walked away.\\n\\n“That’s Yashvin,” Vronsky said in answer to Turovtsin, and he sat down\\nin the vacated seat beside them. He drank the glass offered him, and\\nordered a bottle of wine. Under the influence of the club atmosphere or\\nthe wine he had drunk, Levin chatted away to Vronsky of the best breeds\\nof cattle, and was very glad not to feel the slightest hostility to\\nthis man. He even told him, among other things, that he had heard from\\nhis wife that she had met him at Princess Marya Borissovna’s.\\n\\n“Ah, Princess Marya Borissovna, she’s exquisite!” said Stepan\\nArkadyevitch, and he told an anecdote about her which set them all\\nlaughing. Vronsky particularly laughed with such simplehearted\\namusement that Levin felt quite reconciled to him.\\n\\n“Well, have we finished?” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, getting up with a\\nsmile. “Let us go 8\\n\\nGetting up from the table, Levin walked with Gagin through the lofty\\nroom to the billiard room, feeling his arms swing as he walked with a\\npeculiar lightness and ease. As he crossed the big room, he came upon\\nhis father-in-law.\\n\\n“Well, how do you like our Temple of Indolence?” said the prince,\\ntaking his arm. “Come along, come along!”\\n\\n“Yes, I wanted to walk about and look at everything. It’s interesting.”\\n\\n“Yes, it’s interesting for you. But its interest for me is quite\\ndifferent. You look at those little old men now,” he said, pointing to\\na club member with bent back and projecting lip, shuffling towards them\\nin his soft boots, “and imagine that they were _shlupiks_ like that\\nfrom their birth up.”\\n\\n“How _shlupiks_?”\\n\\n“I see you don’t know that name. That’s our club designation. You know\\nthe game of rolling eggs: when one’s rolled a long while it becomes a\\n_shlupik_. So it is with us; one goes on coming and coming to the club,\\nand ends by becoming a _shlupik_. Ah, you laugh! but we look out, for\\nfear of dropping into it ourselves. You know Prince Tchetchensky?”\\ninquired the prince; and Levin saw by his face that he was just going\\nto relate something funny.\\n\\n“No, I don’t know him.”\\n\\n“You don’t say so! Well, Prince Tchetchensky is a well-known figure. No\\nmatter, though. He’s always playing billiards here. Only three years\\nago he was not a _shlupik_ and kept up his spirits and even used to\\ncall other people _shlupiks_. But one day he turns up, and our porter\\n... you know Vassily? Why, that fat one; he’s famous for his _bon\\nmots_. And so Prince Tchetchensky asks him, ‘Come, Vassily, who’s here?\\nAny _shlupiks_ here yet?’ And he says, ‘You’re the third.’ Yes, my dear\\nboy, that he did!”\\n\\nTalking and greeting the friends they met, Levin and the prince walked\\nthrough all the rooms: the great room where tables had already been\\nset, and the usual partners were playing for small stakes; the divan\\nroom, where they were playing chess, and Sergey Ivanovitch was sitting\\ntalking to somebody; the billiard room, where, about a sofa in a\\nrecess, there was a lively party drinking champagne—Gagin was one of\\nthem. They peeped into the “infernal regions,” where a good many men\\nwere crowding round one table, at which Yashvin was sitting. Trying not\\nto make a noise, they walked into the dark reading room, where under\\nthe shaded lamps there sat a young man with a wrathful countenance,\\nturning over one journal after another, and a bald general buried in a\\nbook. They went, too, into what the prince called the intellectual\\nroom, where three gentlemen were engaged in a heated discussion of the\\nlatest political news.\\n\\n“Prince, please come, we’re ready,” said one of his card party, who had\\ncome to look for him, and the prince went off. Levin sat down and\\nlistened, but recalling all the conversation of the morning he felt all\\nof a sudden fearfully bored. He got up hurriedly, and went to look for\\nOblonsky and Turovtsin, with whom it had been so pleasant.\\n\\nTurovtsin was one of the circle drinking in the billiard room, and\\nStepan Arkadyevitch was talking with Vronsky near the door at the\\nfarther corner of the room.\\n\\n“It’s not that she’s dull; but this undefined, this unsettled\\nposition,” Levin caught, and he was hurrying away, but Stepan\\nArkadyevitch called to him.\\n\\n“Levin,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, and Levin noticed that his eyes were\\nnot full of tears exactly, but moist, which always happened when he had\\nbeen drinking, or when he was touched. Just now it was due to both\\ncauses. “Levin, don’t go,” he said, and he warmly squeezed his arm\\nabove the elbow, obviously not at all wishing to let him go.\\n\\n“This is a true friend of mine—almost my greatest friend,” he said to\\nVronsky. “You have become even closer and dearer to me. And I want you,\\nand I know you ought, to be friends, and great friends, because you’re\\nboth splendid fellows.”\\n\\n“Well, there’s nothing for us now but to kiss and be friends,” Vronsky\\nsaid, with good-natured playfulness, holding out his hand.\\n\\nLevin quickly took the offered hand, and pressed it warmly.\\n\\n“I’m very, very glad,” said Levin.\\n\\n“Waiter, a bottle of champagne,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch.\\n\\n“And I’m very glad,” said Vronsky.\\n\\nBut in spite of Stepan Arkadyevitch’s desire, and their own desire,\\nthey had nothing to talk about, and both felt it.\\n\\n“Do you know, he has never met Anna?” Stepan Arkadyevitch said to\\nVronsky. “And I want above everything to take him to see her. Let us\\ngo, Levin!”\\n\\n“Really?” said Vronsky. “She will be very glad to see you. I should be\\ngoing home at once,” he added, “but I’m worried about Yashvin, and I\\nwant to stay on till he finishes.”\\n\\n“Why, is he losing?”\\n\\n“He keeps losing, and I’m the only friend that can restrain him.”\\n\\n“Well, what do you say to pyramids? Levin, will you play? Capital!”\\nsaid Stepan Arkadyevitch. “Get the table ready,” he said to the marker.\\n\\n“It has been ready a long while,” answered the marker, who had already\\nset the balls in a triangle, and was knocking the red one about for his\\nown diversion.\\n\\n“Well, let us begin.”\\n\\nAfter the game Vronsky and Levin sat down at Gagin’s table, and at\\nStepan Arkadyevitch’s suggestion Levin took a hand in the game.\\n\\nVronsky sat down at the table, surrounded by friends, who were\\nincessantly coming up to him. Every now and then he went to the\\n“infernal” to keep an eye on Yashvin. Levin was enjoying a delightful\\nsense of repose after the mental fatigue of the morning. He was glad\\nthat all hostility was at an end with Vronsky, and the sense of peace,\\ndecorum, and comfort never left him.\\n\\nWhen the game was over, Stepan Arkadyevitch took Levin’s arm.\\n\\n“Well, let us go to Anna’s, then. At once? Eh? She is at home. I\\npromised her long ago to bring you. Where were you meaning to spend the\\nevening?”\\n\\n“Oh, nowhere specially. I promised Sviazhsky to go to the Society of\\nAgriculture. By all means, let us go,” said Levin.\\n\\n“Very good; come along. Find out if my carriage is here,” Stepan\\nArkadyevitch said to the waiter.\\n\\nLevin went up to the table, paid the forty roubles he had lost; paid\\nhis bill, the amount of which was in some mysterious way ascertained by\\nthe little old waiter who stood at the counter, and swinging his arms\\nhe walked through all the rooms to the way out 9\\n\\n“Oblonsky’s carriage!” the porter shouted in an angry bass. The\\ncarriage drove up and both got in. It was only for the first few\\nmoments, while the carriage was driving out of the clubhouse gates,\\nthat Levin was still under the influence of the club atmosphere of\\nrepose, comfort, and unimpeachable good form. But as soon as the\\ncarriage drove out into the street, and he felt it jolting over the\\nuneven road, heard the angry shout of a sledge driver coming towards\\nthem, saw in the uncertain light the red blind of a tavern and the\\nshops, this impression was dissipated, and he began to think over his\\nactions, and to wonder whether he was doing right in going to see Anna.\\nWhat would Kitty say? But Stepan Arkadyevitch gave him no time for\\nreflection, and, as though divining his doubts, he scattered them.\\n\\n“How glad I am,” he said, “that you should know her! You know Dolly has\\nlong wished for it. And Lvov’s been to see her, and often goes. Though\\nshe is my sister,” Stepan Arkadyevitch pursued, “I don’t hesitate to\\nsay that she’s a remarkable woman. But you will see. Her position is\\nvery painful, especially now.”\\n\\n“Why especially now?”\\n\\n“We are carrying on negotiations with her husband about a divorce. And\\nhe’s agreed; but there are difficulties in regard to the son, and the\\nbusiness, which ought to have been arranged long ago, has been dragging\\non for three months past. As soon as the divorce is over, she will\\nmarry Vronsky. How stupid these old ceremonies are, that no one\\nbelieves in, and which only prevent people being comfortable!” Stepan\\nArkadyevitch put in. “Well, then their position will be as regular as\\nmine, as yours.”\\n\\n“What is the difficulty?” said Levin.\\n\\n“Oh, it’s a long and tedious story! The whole business is in such an\\nanomalous position with us. But the point is she has been for three\\nmonths in Moscow, where everyone knows her, waiting for the divorce;\\nshe goes out nowhere, sees no woman except Dolly, because, do you\\nunderstand, she doesn’t care to have people come as a favor. That fool\\nPrincess Varvara, even she has left her, considering this a breach of\\npropriety. Well, you see, in such a position any other woman would not\\nhave found resources in herself. But you’ll see how she has arranged\\nher life—how calm, how dignified she is. To the left, in the crescent\\nopposite the church!” shouted Stepan Arkadyevitch, leaning out of the\\nwindow. “Phew! how hot it is!” he said, in spite of twelve degrees of\\nfrost, flinging his open overcoat still wider open.\\n\\n“But she has a daughter: no doubt she’s busy looking after her?” said\\nLevin.\\n\\n“I believe you picture every woman simply as a female, _une couveuse,_”\\nsaid Stepan Arkadyevitch. “If she’s occupied, it must be with her\\nchildren. No, she brings her up capitally, I believe, but one doesn’t\\nhear about her. She’s busy, in the first place, with what she writes. I\\nsee you’re smiling ironically, but you’re wrong. She’s writing a\\nchildren’s book, and doesn’t talk about it to anyone, but she read it\\nto me and I gave the manuscript to Vorkuev ... you know the publisher\\n... and he’s an author himself too, I fancy. He understands those\\nthings, and he says it’s a remarkable piece of work. But are you\\nfancying she’s an authoress?—not a bit of it. She’s a woman with a\\nheart, before everything, but you’ll see. Now she has a little English\\ngirl with her, and a whole family she’s looking after.”\\n\\n“Oh, something in a philanthropic way?”\\n\\n“Why, you will look at everything in the worst light. It’s not from\\nphilanthropy, it’s from the heart. They—that is, Vronsky—had a trainer,\\nan Englishman, first-rate in his own line, but a drunkard. He’s\\ncompletely given up to drink—delirium tremens—and the family were cast\\non the world. She saw them, helped them, got more and more interested\\nin them, and now the whole family is on her hands. But not by way of\\npatronage, you know, helping with money; she’s herself preparing the\\nboys in Russian for the high school, and she’s taken the little girl to\\nlive with her. But you’ll see her for yourself.”\\n\\nThe carriage drove into the courtyard, and Stepan Arkadyevitch rang\\nloudly at the entrance where sledges were standing.\\n\\nAnd without asking the servant who opened the door whether the lady\\nwere at home, Stepan Arkadyevitch walked into the hall. Levin followed\\nhim, more and more doubtful whether he was doing right or wrong.\\n\\nLooking at himself in the glass, Levin noticed that he was red in the\\nface, but he felt certain he was not drunk, and he followed Stepan\\nArkadyevitch up the carpeted stairs. At the top Stepan Arkadyevitch\\ninquired of the footman, who bowed to him as to an intimate friend, who\\nwas with Anna Arkadyevna, and received the answer that it was M.\\nVorkuev.\\n\\n“Where are they?”\\n\\n“In the study.”\\n\\nPassing through the dining-room, a room not very large, with dark,\\npaneled walls, Stepan Arkadyevitch and Levin walked over the soft\\ncarpet to the half-dark study, lighted up by a single lamp with a big\\ndark shade. Another lamp with a reflector was hanging on the wall,\\nlighting up a big full-length portrait of a woman, which Levin could\\nnot help looking at. It was the portrait of Anna, painted in Italy by\\nMihailov. While Stepan Arkadyevitch went behind the _treillage_, and\\nthe man’s voice which had been speaking paused, Levin gazed at the\\nportrait, which stood out from the frame in the brilliant light thrown\\non it, and he could not tear himself away from it. He positively forgot\\nwhere he was, and not even hearing what was said, he could not take his\\neyes off the marvelous portrait. It was not a picture, but a living,\\ncharming woman, with black curling hair, with bare arms and shoulders,\\nwith a pensive smile on the lips, covered with soft down; triumphantly\\nand softly she looked at him with eyes that baffled him. She was not\\nliving only because she was more beautiful than a living woman can be.\\n\\n“I am delighted!” He heard suddenly near him a voice, unmistakably\\naddressing him, the voice of the very woman he had been admiring in the\\nportrait. Anna had come from behind the _treillage_ to meet him, and\\nLevin saw in the dim light of the study the very woman of the portrait,\\nin a dark blue shot gown, not in the same position nor with the same\\nexpression, but with the same perfection of beauty which the artist had\\ncaught in the portrait. She was less dazzling in reality, but, on the\\nother hand, there was something fresh and seductive in the living woman\\nwhich was not in the portrait 10\\n\\nShe had risen to meet him, not concealing her pleasure at seeing him;\\nand in the quiet ease with which she held out her little vigorous hand,\\nintroduced him to Vorkuev and indicated a red-haired, pretty little\\ngirl who was sitting at work, calling her her pupil, Levin recognized\\nand liked the manners of a woman of the great world, always\\nself-possessed and natural.\\n\\n“I am delighted, delighted,” she repeated, and on her lips these simple\\nwords took for Levin’s ears a special significance. “I have known you\\nand liked you for a long while, both from your friendship with Stiva\\nand for your wife’s sake.... I knew her for a very short time, but she\\nleft on me the impression of an exquisite flower, simply a flower. And\\nto think she will soon be a mother!”\\n\\nShe spoke easily and without haste, looking now and then from Levin to\\nher brother, and Levin felt that the impression he was making was good,\\nand he felt immediately at home, simple and happy with her, as though\\nhe had known her from childhood.\\n\\n“Ivan Petrovitch and I settled in Alexey’s study,” she said in answer\\nto Stepan Arkadyevitch’s question whether he might smoke, “just so as\\nto be able to smoke”—and glancing at Levin, instead of asking whether\\nhe would smoke, she pulled closer a tortoise-shell cigar-case and took\\na cigarette.\\n\\n“How are you feeling today?” her brother asked her.\\n\\n“Oh, nothing. Nerves, as usual.”\\n\\n“Yes, isn’t it extraordinarily fine?” said Stepan Arkadyevitch,\\nnoticing that Levin was scrutinizing the picture.\\n\\n“I have never seen a better portrait.”\\n\\n“And extraordinarily like, isn’t it?” said Vorkuev.\\n\\nLevin looked from the portrait to the original. A peculiar brilliance\\nlighted up Anna’s face when she felt his eyes on her. Levin flushed,\\nand to cover his confusion would have asked whether she had seen Darya\\nAlexandrovna lately; but at that moment Anna spoke. “We were just\\ntalking, Ivan Petrovitch and I, of Vashtchenkov’s last pictures. Have\\nyou seen them?”\\n\\n“Yes, I have seen them,” answered Levin.\\n\\n“But, I beg your pardon, I interrupted you ... you were saying?...”\\n\\nLevin asked if she had seen Dolly lately.\\n\\n“She was here yesterday. She was very indignant with the high school\\npeople on Grisha’s account. The Latin teacher, it seems, had been\\nunfair to him.”\\n\\n“Yes, I have seen his pictures. I didn’t care for them very much,”\\nLevin went back to the subject she had started.\\n\\nLevin talked now not at all with that purely businesslike attitude to\\nthe subject with which he had been talking all the morning. Every word\\nin his conversation with her had a special significance. And talking to\\nher was pleasant; still pleasanter it was to listen to her.\\n\\nAnna talked not merely naturally and cleverly, but cleverly and\\ncarelessly, attaching no value to her own ideas and giving great weight\\nto the ideas of the person she was talking to.\\n\\nThe conversation turned on the new movement in art, on the new\\nillustrations of the Bible by a French artist. Vorkuev attacked the\\nartist for a realism carried to the point of coarseness.\\n\\nLevin said that the French had carried conventionality further than\\nanyone, and that consequently they see a great merit in the return to\\nrealism. In the fact of not lying they see poetry.\\n\\nNever had anything clever said by Levin given him so much pleasure as\\nthis remark. Anna’s face lighted up at once, as at once she appreciated\\nthe thought. She laughed.\\n\\n“I laugh,” she said, “as one laughs when one sees a very true portrait.\\nWhat you said so perfectly hits off French art now, painting and\\nliterature too, indeed—Zola, Daudet. But perhaps it is always so, that\\nmen form their conceptions from fictitious, conventional types, and\\nthen—all the _combinaisons_ made—they are tired of the fictitious\\nfigures and begin to invent more natural, true figures.”\\n\\n“That’s perfectly true,” said Vorknev.\\n\\n“So you’ve been at the club?” she said to her brother.\\n\\n“Yes, yes, this is a woman!” Levin thought, forgetting himself and\\nstaring persistently at her lovely, mobile face, which at that moment\\nwas all at once completely transformed. Levin did not hear what she was\\ntalking of as she leaned over to her brother, but he was struck by the\\nchange of her expression. Her face—so handsome a moment before in its\\nrepose—suddenly wore a look of strange curiosity, anger, and pride. But\\nthis lasted only an instant. She dropped her eyelids, as though\\nrecollecting something.\\n\\n“Oh, well, but that’s of no interest to anyone,” she said, and she\\nturned to the English girl.\\n\\n“Please order the tea in the drawing-room,” she said in English.\\n\\nThe girl got up and went out.\\n\\n“Well, how did she get through her examination?” asked Stepan\\nArkadyevitch.\\n\\n“Splendidly! She’s a very gifted child and a sweet character.”\\n\\n“It will end in your loving her more than your own.”\\n\\n“There a man speaks. In love there’s no more nor less. I love my\\ndaughter with one love, and her with another.”\\n\\n“I was just telling Anna Arkadyevna,” said Vorkuev, “that if she were\\nto put a hundredth part of the energy she devotes to this English girl\\nto the public question of the education of Russian children, she would\\nbe doing a great and useful work.”\\n\\n“Yes, but I can’t help it; I couldn’t do it. Count Alexey Kirillovitch\\nurged me very much” (as she uttered the words _Count Alexey\\nKirillovitch_ she glanced with appealing timidity at Levin, and he\\nunconsciously responded with a respectful and reassuring look); “he\\nurged me to take up the school in the village. I visited it several\\ntimes. The children were very nice, but I could not feel drawn to the\\nwork. You speak of energy. Energy rests upon love; and come as it will,\\nthere’s no forcing it. I took to this child—I could not myself say\\nwhy.”\\n\\nAnd she glanced again at Levin. And her smile and her glance—all told\\nhim that it was to him only she was addressing her words, valuing his\\ngood opinion, and at the same time sure beforehand that they understood\\neach other.\\n\\n“I quite understand that,” Levin answered. “It’s impossible to give\\none’s heart to a school or such institutions in general, and I believe\\nthat’s just why philanthropic institutions always give such poor\\nresults.”\\n\\nShe was silent for a while, then she smiled.\\n\\n“Yes, yes,” she agreed; “I never could. _Je n’ai pas le cœur assez_\\nlarge to love a whole asylum of horrid little girls. _Cela ne m’a\\njamais réussi._ There are so many women who have made themselves _une\\nposition sociale_ in that way. And now more than ever,” she said with a\\nmournful, confiding expression, ostensibly addressing her brother, but\\nunmistakably intending her words only for Levin, “now when I have such\\nneed of some occupation, I cannot.” And suddenly frowning (Levin saw\\nthat she was frowning at herself for talking about herself) she changed\\nthe subject. “I know about you,” she said to Levin; “that you’re not a\\npublic-spirited citizen, and I have defended you to the best of my\\nability.”\\n\\n“How have you defended me?”\\n\\n“Oh, according to the attacks made on you. But won’t you have some\\ntea?” She rose and took up a book bound in morocco.\\n\\n“Give it to me, Anna Arkadyevna,” said Vorkuev, indicating the book.\\n“It’s well worth taking up.”\\n\\n“Oh, no, it’s all so sketchy.”\\n\\n“I told him about it,” Stepan Arkadyevitch said to his sister, nodding\\nat Levin.\\n\\n“You shouldn’t have. My writing is something after the fashion of those\\nlittle baskets and carving which Liza Mertsalova used to sell me from\\nthe prisons. She had the direction of the prison department in that\\nsociety,” she turned to Levin; “and they were miracles of patience, the\\nwork of those poor wretches.”\\n\\nAnd Levin saw a new trait in this woman, who attracted him so\\nextraordinarily. Besides wit, grace, and beauty, she had truth. She had\\nno wish to hide from him all the bitterness of her position. As she\\nsaid that she sighed, and her face suddenly taking a hard expression,\\nlooked as it were turned to stone. With that expression on her face she\\nwas more beautiful than ever; but the expression was new; it was\\nutterly unlike that expression, radiant with happiness and creating\\nhappiness, which had been caught by the painter in her portrait. Levin\\nlooked more than once at the portrait and at her figure, as taking her\\nbrother’s arm she walked with him to the high doors and he felt for her\\na tenderness and pity at which he wondered himself.\\n\\nShe asked Levin and Vorkuev to go into the drawing-room, while she\\nstayed behind to say a few words to her brother. “About her divorce,\\nabout Vronsky, and what he’s doing at the club, about me?” wondered\\nLevin. And he was so keenly interested by the question of what she was\\nsaying to Stepan Arkadyevitch, that he scarcely heard what Vorkuev was\\ntelling him of the qualities of the story for children Anna Arkadyevna\\nhad written.\\n\\nAt tea the same pleasant sort of talk, full of interesting matter,\\ncontinued. There was not a single instant when a subject for\\nconversation was to seek; on the contrary, it was felt that one had\\nhardly time to say what one had to say, and eagerly held back to hear\\nwhat the others were saying. And all that was said, not only by her,\\nbut by Vorkuev and Stepan Arkadyevitch—all, so it seemed to Levin,\\ngained peculiar significance from her appreciation and her criticism.\\nWhile he followed this interesting conversation, Levin was all the time\\nadmiring her—her beauty, her intelligence, her culture, and at the same\\ntime her directness and genuine depth of feeling. He listened and\\ntalked, and all the while he was thinking of her inner life, trying to\\ndivine her feelings. And though he had judged her so severely hitherto,\\nnow by some strange chain of reasoning he was justifying her and was\\nalso sorry for her, and afraid that Vronsky did not fully understand\\nher. At eleven o’clock, when Stepan Arkadyevitch got up to go (Vorkuev\\nhad left earlier), it seemed to Levin that he had only just come.\\nRegretfully Levin too rose.\\n\\n“Good-bye,” she said, holding his hand and glancing into his face with\\na winning look. “I am very glad _que la glace est rompue._”\\n\\nShe dropped his hand, and half closed her eyes.\\n\\n“Tell your wife that I love her as before, and that if she cannot\\npardon me my position, then my wish for her is that she may never\\npardon it. To pardon it, one must go through what I have gone through,\\nand may God spare her that.”\\n\\n“Certainly, yes, I will tell her....” Levin said, blushing 11\\n\\n“What a marvelous, sweet and unhappy woman!” he was thinking, as he\\nstepped out into the frosty air with Stepan Arkadyevitch.\\n\\n“Well, didn’t I tell you?” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, seeing that Levin\\nhad been completely won over.\\n\\n“Yes,” said Levin dreamily, “an extraordinary woman! It’s not her\\ncleverness, but she has such wonderful depth of feeling. I’m awfully\\nsorry for her!”\\n\\n“Now, please God, everything will soon be settled. Well, well, don’t be\\nhard on people in future,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, opening the\\ncarriage door. “Good-bye; we don’t go the same way.”\\n\\nStill thinking of Anna, of everything, even the simplest phrase in\\ntheir conversation with her, and recalling the minutest changes in her\\nexpression, entering more and more into her position, and feeling\\nsympathy for her, Levin reached home.\\n\\n\\n\\nAt home Kouzma told Levin that Katerina Alexandrovna was quite well,\\nand that her sisters had not long been gone, and he handed him two\\nletters. Levin read them at once in the hall, that he might not\\noverlook them later. One was from Sokolov, his bailiff. Sokolov wrote\\nthat the corn could not be sold, that it was fetching only five and a\\nhalf roubles, and that more than that could not be got for it. The\\nother letter was from his sister. She scolded him for her business\\nbeing still unsettled.\\n\\n“Well, we must sell it at five and a half if we can’t get more,” Levin\\ndecided the first question, which had always before seemed such a\\nweighty one, with extraordinary facility on the spot. “It’s\\nextraordinary how all one’s time is taken up here,” he thought,\\nconsidering the second letter. He felt himself to blame for not having\\ngot done what his sister had asked him to do for her. “Today, again,\\nI’ve not been to the court, but today I’ve certainly not had time.” And\\nresolving that he would not fail to do it next day, he went up to his\\nwife. As he went in, Levin rapidly ran through mentally the day he had\\nspent. All the events of the day were conversations, conversations he\\nhad heard and taken part in. All the conversations were upon subjects\\nwhich, if he had been alone at home, he would never have taken up, but\\nhere they were very interesting. And all these conversations were right\\nenough, only in two places there was something not quite right. One was\\nwhat he had said about the carp, the other was something not “quite the\\nthing” in the tender sympathy he was feeling for Anna.\\n\\nLevin found his wife low-spirited and dull. The dinner of the three\\nsisters had gone off very well, but then they had waited and waited for\\nhim, all of them had felt dull, the sisters had departed, and she had\\nbeen left alone.\\n\\n“Well, and what have you been doing?” she asked him, looking straight\\ninto his eyes, which shone with rather a suspicious brightness. But\\nthat she might not prevent his telling her everything, she concealed\\nher close scrutiny of him, and with an approving smile listened to his\\naccount of how he had spent the evening.\\n\\n“Well, I’m very glad I met Vronsky. I felt quite at ease and natural\\nwith him. You understand, I shall try not to see him, but I’m glad that\\nthis awkwardness is all over,” he said, and remembering that by way of\\ntrying not to see him, he had immediately gone to call on Anna, he\\nblushed. “We talk about the peasants drinking; I don’t know which\\ndrinks most, the peasantry or our own class; the peasants do on\\nholidays, but....”\\n\\nBut Kitty took not the slightest interest in discussing the drinking\\nhabits of the peasants. She saw that he blushed, and she wanted to know\\nwhy.\\n\\n“Well, and then where did you go?”\\n\\n“Stiva urged me awfully to go and see Anna Arkadyevna.”\\n\\nAnd as he said this, Levin blushed even more, and his doubts as to\\nwhether he had done right in going to see Anna were settled once for\\nall. He knew now that he ought not to have done so.\\n\\nKitty’s eyes opened in a curious way and gleamed at Anna’s name, but\\ncontrolling herself with an effort, she concealed her emotion and\\ndeceived him.\\n\\n“Oh!” was all she said.\\n\\n“I’m sure you won’t be angry at my going. Stiva begged me to, and Dolly\\nwished it,” Levin went on.\\n\\n“Oh, no!” she said, but he saw in her eyes a constraint that boded him\\nno good.\\n\\n“She is a very sweet, very, very unhappy, good woman,” he said, telling\\nher about Anna, her occupations, and what she had told him to say to\\nher.\\n\\n“Yes, of course, she is very much to be pitied,” said Kitty, when he\\nhad finished. “Whom was your letter from?”\\n\\nHe told her, and believing in her calm tone, he went to change his\\ncoat.\\n\\nComing back, he found Kitty in the same easy chair. When he went up to\\nher, she glanced at him and broke into sobs.\\n\\n“What? what is it?” he asked, knowing beforehand what.\\n\\n“You’re in love with that hateful woman; she has bewitched you! I saw\\nit in your eyes. Yes, yes! What can it all lead to? You were drinking\\nat the club, drinking and gambling, and then you went ... to her of all\\npeople! No, we must go away.... I shall go away tomorrow.”\\n\\nIt was a long while before Levin could soothe his wife. At last he\\nsucceeded in calming her, only by confessing that a feeling of pity, in\\nconjunction with the wine he had drunk, had been too much for him, that\\nhe had succumbed to Anna’s artful influence, and that he would avoid\\nher. One thing he did with more sincerity confess to was that living so\\nlong in Moscow, a life of nothing but conversation, eating and\\ndrinking, he was degenerating. They talked till three o’clock in the\\nmorning. Only at three o’clock were they sufficiently reconciled to be\\nable to go to sleep 12\\n\\nAfter taking leave of her guests, Anna did not sit down, but began\\nwalking up and down the room. She had unconsciously the whole evening\\ndone her utmost to arouse in Levin a feeling of love—as of late she had\\nfallen into doing with all young men—and she knew she had attained her\\naim, as far as was possible in one evening, with a married and\\nconscientious man. She liked him indeed extremely, and, in spite of the\\nstriking difference, from the masculine point of view, between Vronsky\\nand Levin, as a woman she saw something they had in common, which had\\nmade Kitty able to love both. Yet as soon as he was out of the room,\\nshe ceased to think of him.\\n\\nOne thought, and one only, pursued her in different forms, and refused\\nto be shaken off. “If I have so much effect on others, on this man, who\\nloves his home and his wife, why is it _he_ is so cold to me?... not\\ncold exactly, he loves me, I know that! But something new is drawing us\\napart now. Why wasn’t he here all the evening? He told Stiva to say he\\ncould not leave Yashvin, and must watch over his play. Is Yashvin a\\nchild? But supposing it’s true. He never tells a lie. But there’s\\nsomething else in it if it’s true. He is glad of an opportunity of\\nshowing me that he has other duties; I know that, I submit to that. But\\nwhy prove that to me? He wants to show me that his love for me is not\\nto interfere with his freedom. But I need no proofs, I need love. He\\nought to understand all the bitterness of this life for me here in\\nMoscow. Is this life? I am not living, but waiting for an event, which\\nis continually put off and put off. No answer again! And Stiva says he\\ncannot go to Alexey Alexandrovitch. And I can’t write again. I can do\\nnothing, can begin nothing, can alter nothing; I hold myself in, I\\nwait, inventing amusements for myself—the English family, writing,\\nreading—but it’s all nothing but a sham, it’s all the same as morphine.\\nHe ought to feel for me,” she said, feeling tears of self-pity coming\\ninto her eyes.\\n\\nShe heard Vronsky’s abrupt ring and hurriedly dried her tears—not only\\ndried her tears, but sat down by a lamp and opened a book, affecting\\ncomposure. She wanted to show him that she was displeased that he had\\nnot come home as he had promised—displeased only, and not on any\\naccount to let him see her distress, and least of all, her self-pity.\\nShe might pity herself, but he must not pity her. She did not want\\nstrife, she blamed him for wanting to quarrel, but unconsciously put\\nherself into an attitude of antagonism.\\n\\n“Well, you’ve not been dull?” he said, eagerly and good-humoredly,\\ngoing up to her. “What a terrible passion it is—gambling!”\\n\\n“No, I’ve not been dull; I’ve learned long ago not to be dull. Stiva\\nhas been here and Levin.”\\n\\n“Yes, they meant to come and see you. Well, how did you like Levin?” he\\nsaid, sitting down beside her.\\n\\n“Very much. They have not long been gone. What was Yashvin doing?”\\n\\n“He was winning—seventeen thousand. I got him away. He had really\\nstarted home, but he went back again, and now he’s losing.”\\n\\n“Then what did you stay for?” she asked, suddenly lifting her eyes to\\nhim. The expression of her face was cold and ungracious. “You told\\nStiva you were staying on to get Yashvin away. And you have left him\\nthere.”\\n\\nThe same expression of cold readiness for the conflict appeared on his\\nface too.\\n\\n“In the first place, I did not ask him to give you any message; and\\nsecondly, I never tell lies. But what’s the chief point, I wanted to\\nstay, and I stayed,” he said, frowning. “Anna, what is it for, why will\\nyou?” he said after a moment’s silence, bending over towards her, and\\nhe opened his hand, hoping she would lay hers in it.\\n\\nShe was glad of this appeal for tenderness. But some strange force of\\nevil would not let her give herself up to her feelings, as though the\\nrules of warfare would not permit her to surrender.\\n\\n“Of course you wanted to stay, and you stayed. You do everything you\\nwant to. But what do you tell me that for? With what object?” she said,\\ngetting more and more excited. “Does anyone contest your rights? But\\nyou want to be right, and you’re welcome to be right.”\\n\\nHis hand closed, he turned away, and his face wore a still more\\nobstinate expression.\\n\\n“For you it’s a matter of obstinacy,” she said, watching him intently\\nand suddenly finding the right word for that expression that irritated\\nher, “simply obstinacy. For you it’s a question of whether you keep the\\nupper hand of me, while for me....” Again she felt sorry for herself,\\nand she almost burst into tears. “If you knew what it is for me! When I\\nfeel as I do now that you are hostile, yes, hostile to me, if you knew\\nwhat this means for me! If you knew how I feel on the brink of calamity\\nat this instant, how afraid I am of myself!” And she turned away,\\nhiding her sobs.\\n\\n“But what are you talking about?” he said, horrified at her expression\\nof despair, and again bending over her, he took her hand and kissed it.\\n“What is it for? Do I seek amusements outside our home? Don’t I avoid\\nthe society of women?”\\n\\n“Well, yes! If that were all!” she said.\\n\\n“Come, tell me what I ought to do to give you peace of mind? I am ready\\nto do anything to make you happy,” he said, touched by her expression\\nof despair; “what wouldn’t I do to save you from distress of any sort,\\nas now, Anna!” he said.\\n\\n“It’s nothing, nothing!” she said. “I don’t know myself whether it’s\\nthe solitary life, my nerves.... Come, don’t let us talk of it. What\\nabout the race? You haven’t told me!” she inquired, trying to conceal\\nher triumph at the victory, which had anyway been on her side.\\n\\nHe asked for supper, and began telling her about the races; but in his\\ntone, in his eyes, which became more and more cold, she saw that he did\\nnot forgive her for her victory, that the feeling of obstinacy with\\nwhich she had been struggling had asserted itself again in him. He was\\ncolder to her than before, as though he were regretting his surrender.\\nAnd she, remembering the words that had given her the victory, “how I\\nfeel on the brink of calamity, how afraid I am of myself,” saw that\\nthis weapon was a dangerous one, and that it could not be used a second\\ntime. And she felt that beside the love that bound them together there\\nhad grown up between them some evil spirit of strife, which she could\\nnot exorcise from his, and still less from her own heart 13\\n\\nThere are no conditions to which a man cannot become used, especially\\nif he sees that all around him are living in the same way. Levin could\\nnot have believed three months before that he could have gone quietly\\nto sleep in the condition in which he was that day, that leading an\\naimless, irrational life, living too beyond his means, after drinking\\nto excess (he could not call what happened at the club anything else),\\nforming inappropriately friendly relations with a man with whom his\\nwife had once been in love, and a still more inappropriate call upon a\\nwoman who could only be called a lost woman, after being fascinated by\\nthat woman and causing his wife distress—he could still go quietly to\\nsleep. But under the influence of fatigue, a sleepless night, and the\\nwine he had drunk, his sleep was sound and untroubled.\\n\\nAt five o’clock the creak of a door opening waked him. He jumped up and\\nlooked round. Kitty was not in bed beside him. But there was a light\\nmoving behind the screen, and he heard her steps.\\n\\n“What is it?... what is it?” he said, half-asleep. “Kitty! What is it?”\\n\\n“Nothing,” she said, coming from behind the screen with a candle in her\\nhand. “I felt unwell,” she said, smiling a particularly sweet and\\nmeaning smile.\\n\\n“What? has it begun?” he said in terror. “We ought to send....” and\\nhurriedly he reached after his clothes.\\n\\n“No, no,” she said, smiling and holding his hand. “It’s sure to be\\nnothing. I was rather unwell, only a little. It’s all over now.”\\n\\nAnd getting into bed, she blew out the candle, lay down and was still.\\nThough he thought her stillness suspicious, as though she were holding\\nher breath, and still more suspicious the expression of peculiar\\ntenderness and excitement with which, as she came from behind the\\nscreen, she said “nothing,” he was so sleepy that he fell asleep at\\nonce. Only later he remembered the stillness of her breathing, and\\nunderstood all that must have been passing in her sweet, precious heart\\nwhile she lay beside him, not stirring, in anticipation of the greatest\\nevent in a woman’s life. At seven o’clock he was waked by the touch of\\nher hand on his shoulder, and a gentle whisper. She seemed struggling\\nbetween regret at waking him, and the desire to talk to him.\\n\\n“Kostya, don’t be frightened. It’s all right. But I fancy.... We ought\\nto send for Lizaveta Petrovna.”\\n\\nThe candle was lighted again. She was sitting up in bed, holding some\\nknitting, which she had been busy upon during the last few days.\\n\\n“Please, don’t be frightened, it’s all right. I’m not a bit afraid,”\\nshe said, seeing his scared face, and she pressed his hand to her bosom\\nand then to her lips.\\n\\nHe hurriedly jumped up, hardly awake, and kept his eyes fixed on her,\\nas he put on his dressing gown; then he stopped, still looking at her.\\nHe had to go, but he could not tear himself from her eyes. He thought\\nhe loved her face, knew her expression, her eyes, but never had he seen\\nit like this. How hateful and horrible he seemed to himself, thinking\\nof the distress he had caused her yesterday. Her flushed face, fringed\\nwith soft curling hair under her night cap, was radiant with joy and\\ncourage.\\n\\nThough there was so little that was complex or artificial in Kitty’s\\ncharacter in general, Levin was struck by what was revealed now, when\\nsuddenly all disguises were thrown off and the very kernel of her soul\\nshone in her eyes. And in this simplicity and nakedness of her soul,\\nshe, the very woman he loved in her, was more manifest than ever. She\\nlooked at him, smiling; but all at once her brows twitched, she threw\\nup her head, and going quickly up to him, clutched his hand and pressed\\nclose up to him, breathing her hot breath upon him. She was in pain and\\nwas, as it were, complaining to him of her suffering. And for the first\\nminute, from habit, it seemed to him that he was to blame. But in her\\neyes there was a tenderness that told him that she was far from\\nreproaching him, that she loved him for her sufferings. “If not I, who\\nis to blame for it?” he thought unconsciously, seeking someone\\nresponsible for this suffering for him to punish; but there was no one\\nresponsible. She was suffering, complaining, and triumphing in her\\nsufferings, and rejoicing in them, and loving them. He saw that\\nsomething sublime was being accomplished in her soul, but what? He\\ncould not make it out. It was beyond his understanding.\\n\\n“I have sent to mamma. You go quickly to fetch Lizaveta Petrovna ...\\nKostya!... Nothing, it’s over.”\\n\\nShe moved away from him and rang the bell.\\n\\n“Well, go now; Pasha’s coming. I am all right.”\\n\\nAnd Levin saw with astonishment that she had taken up the knitting she\\nhad brought in in the night and begun working at it again.\\n\\nAs Levin was going out of one door, he heard the maid-servant come in\\nat the other. He stood at the door and heard Kitty giving exact\\ndirections to the maid, and beginning to help her move the bedstead.\\n\\nHe dressed, and while they were putting in his horses, as a hired\\nsledge was not to be seen yet, he ran again up to the bedroom, not on\\ntiptoe, it seemed to him, but on wings. Two maid-servants were\\ncarefully moving something in the bedroom.\\n\\nKitty was walking about knitting rapidly and giving directions.\\n\\n“I’m going for the doctor. They have sent for Lizaveta Petrovna, but\\nI’ll go on there too. Isn’t there anything wanted? Yes, shall I go to\\nDolly’s?”\\n\\nShe looked at him, obviously not hearing what he was saying.\\n\\n“Yes, yes. Do go,” she said quickly, frowning and waving her hand to\\nhim.\\n\\nHe had just gone into the drawing-room, when suddenly a plaintive moan\\nsounded from the bedroom, smothered instantly. He stood still, and for\\na long while he could not understand.\\n\\n“Yes, that is she,” he said to himself, and clutching at his head he\\nran downstairs.\\n\\n“Lord have mercy on us! pardon us! aid us!” he repeated the words that\\nfor some reason came suddenly to his lips. And he, an unbeliever,\\nrepeated these words not with his lips only. At that instant he knew\\nthat all his doubts, even the impossibility of believing with his\\nreason, of which he was aware in himself, did not in the least hinder\\nhis turning to God. All of that now floated out of his soul like dust.\\nTo whom was he to turn if not to Him in whose hands he felt himself,\\nhis soul, and his love?\\n\\nThe horse was not yet ready, but feeling a peculiar concentration of\\nhis physical forces and his intellect on what he had to do, he started\\noff on foot without waiting for the horse, and told Kouzma to overtake\\nhim.\\n\\nAt the corner he met a night cabman driving hurriedly. In the little\\nsledge, wrapped in a velvet cloak, sat Lizaveta Petrovna with a\\nkerchief round her head. “Thank God! thank God!” he said, overjoyed to\\nrecognize her little fair face which wore a peculiarly serious, even\\nstern expression. Telling the driver not to stop, he ran along beside\\nher.\\n\\n“For two hours, then? Not more?” she inquired. “You should let Pyotr\\nDmitrievitch know, but don’t hurry him. And get some opium at the\\nchemist’s.”\\n\\n“So you think that it may go on well? Lord have mercy on us and help\\nus!” Levin said, seeing his own horse driving out of the gate. Jumping\\ninto the sledge beside Kouzma, he told him to drive to the doctor’s 14\\n\\nThe doctor was not yet up, and the footman said that “he had been up\\nlate, and had given orders not to be waked, but would get up soon.” The\\nfootman was cleaning the lamp-chimneys, and seemed very busy about\\nthem. This concentration of the footman upon his lamps, and his\\nindifference to what was passing in Levin, at first astounded him, but\\nimmediately on considering the question he realized that no one knew or\\nwas bound to know his feelings, and that it was all the more necessary\\nto act calmly, sensibly, and resolutely to get through this wall of\\nindifference and attain his aim.\\n\\n“Don’t be in a hurry or let anything slip,” Levin said to himself,\\nfeeling a greater and greater flow of physical energy and attention to\\nall that lay before him to do.\\n\\nHaving ascertained that the doctor was not getting up, Levin considered\\nvarious plans, and decided on the following one: that Kouzma should go\\nfor another doctor, while he himself should go to the chemist’s for\\nopium, and if when he came back the doctor had not yet begun to get up,\\nhe would either by tipping the footman, or by force, wake the doctor at\\nall hazards.\\n\\nAt the chemist’s the lank shopman sealed up a packet of powders for a\\ncoachman who stood waiting, and refused him opium with the same\\ncallousness with which the doctor’s footman had cleaned his lamp\\nchimneys. Trying not to get flurried or out of temper, Levin mentioned\\nthe names of the doctor and midwife, and explaining what the opium was\\nneeded for, tried to persuade him. The assistant inquired in German\\nwhether he should give it, and receiving an affirmative reply from\\nbehind the partition, he took out a bottle and a funnel, deliberately\\npoured the opium from a bigger bottle into a little one, stuck on a\\nlabel, sealed it up, in spite of Levin’s request that he would not do\\nso, and was about to wrap it up too. This was more than Levin could\\nstand; he took the bottle firmly out of his hands, and ran to the big\\nglass doors. The doctor was not even now getting up, and the footman,\\nbusy now in putting down the rugs, refused to wake him. Levin\\ndeliberately took out a ten rouble note, and, careful to speak slowly,\\nthough losing no time over the business, he handed him the note, and\\nexplained that Pyotr Dmitrievitch (what a great and important personage\\nhe seemed to Levin now, this Pyotr Dmitrievitch, who had been of so\\nlittle consequence in his eyes before!) had promised to come at any\\ntime; that he would certainly not be angry! and that he must therefore\\nwake him at once.\\n\\nThe footman agreed, and went upstairs, taking Levin into the waiting\\nroom.\\n\\nLevin could hear through the door the doctor coughing, moving about,\\nwashing, and saying something. Three minutes passed; it seemed to Levin\\nthat more than an hour had gone by. He could not wait any longer.\\n\\n“Pyotr Dmitrievitch, Pyotr Dmitrievitch!” he said in an imploring voice\\nat the open door. “For God’s sake, forgive me! See me as you are. It’s\\nbeen going on more than two hours already.”\\n\\n“In a minute; in a minute!” answered a voice, and to his amazement\\nLevin heard that the doctor was smiling as he spoke.\\n\\n“For one instant.”\\n\\n“In a minute.”\\n\\nTwo minutes more passed while the doctor was putting on his boots, and\\ntwo minutes more while the doctor put on his coat and combed his hair.\\n\\n“Pyotr Dmitrievitch!” Levin was beginning again in a plaintive voice,\\njust as the doctor came in dressed and ready. “These people have no\\nconscience,” thought Levin. “Combing his hair, while we’re dying!”\\n\\n“Good morning!” the doctor said to him, shaking hands, and, as it were,\\nteasing him with his composure. “There’s no hurry. Well now?”\\n\\nTrying to be as accurate as possible, Levin began to tell him every\\nunnecessary detail of his wife’s condition, interrupting his account\\nrepeatedly with entreaties that the doctor would come with him at once.\\n\\n“Oh, you needn’t be in any hurry. You don’t understand, you know. I’m\\ncertain I’m not wanted, still I’ve promised, and if you like, I’ll\\ncome. But there’s no hurry. Please sit down; won’t you have some\\ncoffee?”\\n\\nLevin stared at him with eyes that asked whether he was laughing at\\nhim; but the doctor had no notion of making fun of him.\\n\\n“I know, I know,” the doctor said, smiling; “I’m a married man myself;\\nand at these moments we husbands are very much to be pitied. I’ve a\\npatient whose husband always takes refuge in the stables on such\\noccasions.”\\n\\n“But what do you think, Pyotr Dmitrievitch? Do you suppose it may go\\nall right?”\\n\\n“Everything points to a favorable issue.”\\n\\n“So you’ll come immediately?” said Levin, looking wrathfully at the\\nservant who was bringing in the coffee.\\n\\n“In an hour’s time.”\\n\\n“Oh, for mercy’s sake!”\\n\\n“Well, let me drink my coffee, anyway.”\\n\\nThe doctor started upon his coffee. Both were silent.\\n\\n“The Turks are really getting beaten, though. Did you read yesterday’s\\ntelegrams?” said the doctor, munching some roll.\\n\\n“No, I can’t stand it!” said Levin, jumping up. “So you’ll be with us\\nin a quarter of an hour.”\\n\\n“In half an hour.”\\n\\n“On your honor?”\\n\\nWhen Levin got home, he drove up at the same time as the princess, and\\nthey went up to the bedroom door together. The princess had tears in\\nher eyes, and her hands were shaking. Seeing Levin, she embraced him,\\nand burst into tears.\\n\\n“Well, my dear Lizaveta Petrovna?” she queried, clasping the hand of\\nthe midwife, who came out to meet them with a beaming and anxious face.\\n\\n“She’s going on well,” she said; “persuade her to lie down. She will be\\neasier so.”\\n\\nFrom the moment when he had waked up and understood what was going on,\\nLevin had prepared his mind to bear resolutely what was before him, and\\nwithout considering or anticipating anything, to avoid upsetting his\\nwife, and on the contrary to soothe her and keep up her courage.\\nWithout allowing himself even to think of what was to come, of how it\\nwould end, judging from his inquiries as to the usual duration of these\\nordeals, Levin had in his imagination braced himself to bear up and to\\nkeep a tight rein on his feelings for five hours, and it had seemed to\\nhim he could do this. But when he came back from the doctor’s and saw\\nher sufferings again, he fell to repeating more and more frequently:\\n“Lord, have mercy on us, and succor us!” He sighed, and flung his head\\nup, and began to feel afraid he could not bear it, that he would burst\\ninto tears or run away. Such agony it was to him. And only one hour had\\npassed.\\n\\nBut after that hour there passed another hour, two hours, three, the\\nfull five hours he had fixed as the furthest limit of his sufferings,\\nand the position was still unchanged; and he was still bearing it\\nbecause there was nothing to be done but bear it; every instant feeling\\nthat he had reached the utmost limits of his endurance, and that his\\nheart would break with sympathy and pain.\\n\\nBut still the minutes passed by and the hours, and still hours more,\\nand his misery and horror grew and were more and more intense.\\n\\nAll the ordinary conditions of life, without which one can form no\\nconception of anything, had ceased to exist for Levin. He lost all\\nsense of time. Minutes—those minutes when she sent for him and he held\\nher moist hand, that would squeeze his hand with extraordinary violence\\nand then push it away—seemed to him hours, and hours seemed to him\\nminutes. He was surprised when Lizaveta Petrovna asked him to light a\\ncandle behind a screen, and he found that it was five o’clock in the\\nafternoon. If he had been told it was only ten o’clock in the morning,\\nhe would not have been more surprised. Where he was all this time, he\\nknew as little as the time of anything. He saw her swollen face,\\nsometimes bewildered and in agony, sometimes smiling and trying to\\nreassure him. He saw the old princess too, flushed and overwrought,\\nwith her gray curls in disorder, forcing herself to gulp down her\\ntears, biting her lips; he saw Dolly too and the doctor, smoking fat\\ncigarettes, and Lizaveta Petrovna with a firm, resolute, reassuring\\nface, and the old prince walking up and down the hall with a frowning\\nface. But why they came in and went out, where they were, he did not\\nknow. The princess was with the doctor in the bedroom, then in the\\nstudy, where a table set for dinner suddenly appeared; then she was not\\nthere, but Dolly was. Then Levin remembered he had been sent somewhere.\\nOnce he had been sent to move a table and sofa. He had done this\\neagerly, thinking it had to be done for her sake, and only later on he\\nfound it was his own bed he had been getting ready. Then he had been\\nsent to the study to ask the doctor something. The doctor had answered\\nand then had said something about the irregularities in the municipal\\ncouncil. Then he had been sent to the bedroom to help the old princess\\nto move the holy picture in its silver and gold setting, and with the\\nprincess’s old waiting maid he had clambered on a shelf to reach it and\\nhad broken the little lamp, and the old servant had tried to reassure\\nhim about the lamp and about his wife, and he carried the holy picture\\nand set it at Kitty’s head, carefully tucking it in behind the pillow.\\nBut where, when, and why all this had happened, he could not tell. He\\ndid not understand why the old princess took his hand, and looking\\ncompassionately at him, begged him not to worry himself, and Dolly\\npersuaded him to eat something and led him out of the room, and even\\nthe doctor looked seriously and with commiseration at him and offered\\nhim a drop of something.\\n\\nAll he knew and felt was that what was happening was what had happened\\nnearly a year before in the hotel of the country town at the deathbed\\nof his brother Nikolay. But that had been grief—this was joy. Yet that\\ngrief and this joy were alike outside all the ordinary conditions of\\nlife; they were loop-holes, as it were, in that ordinary life through\\nwhich there came glimpses of something sublime. And in the\\ncontemplation of this sublime something the soul was exalted to\\ninconceivable heights of which it had before had no conception, while\\nreason lagged behind, unable to keep up with it.\\n\\n“Lord, have mercy on us, and succor us!” he repeated to himself\\nincessantly, feeling, in spite of his long and, as it seemed, complete\\nalienation from religion, that he turned to God just as trustfully and\\nsimply as he had in his childhood and first youth.\\n\\nAll this time he had two distinct spiritual conditions. One was away\\nfrom her, with the doctor, who kept smoking one fat cigarette after\\nanother and extinguishing them on the edge of a full ashtray, with\\nDolly, and with the old prince, where there was talk about dinner,\\nabout politics, about Marya Petrovna’s illness, and where Levin\\nsuddenly forgot for a minute what was happening, and felt as though he\\nhad waked up from sleep; the other was in her presence, at her pillow,\\nwhere his heart seemed breaking and still did not break from\\nsympathetic suffering, and he prayed to God without ceasing. And every\\ntime he was brought back from a moment of oblivion by a scream reaching\\nhim from the bedroom, he fell into the same strange terror that had\\ncome upon him the first minute. Every time he heard a shriek, he jumped\\nup, ran to justify himself, remembered on the way that he was not to\\nblame, and he longed to defend her, to help her. But as he looked at\\nher, he saw again that help was impossible, and he was filled with\\nterror and prayed: “Lord, have mercy on us, and help us!” And as time\\nwent on, both these conditions became more intense; the calmer he\\nbecame away from her, completely forgetting her, the more agonizing\\nbecame both her sufferings and his feeling of helplessness before them.\\nHe jumped up, would have liked to run away, but ran to her.\\n\\nSometimes, when again and again she called upon him, he blamed her; but\\nseeing her patient, smiling face, and hearing the words, “I am worrying\\nyou,” he threw the blame on God; but thinking of God, at once he fell\\nto beseeching God to forgive him and have mercy 15\\n\\nHe did not know whether it was late or early. The candles had all\\nburned out. Dolly had just been in the study and had suggested to the\\ndoctor that he should lie down. Levin sat listening to the doctor’s\\nstories of a quack mesmerizer and looking at the ashes of his\\ncigarette. There had been a period of repose, and he had sunk into\\noblivion. He had completely forgotten what was going on now. He heard\\nthe doctor’s chat and understood it. Suddenly there came an unearthly\\nshriek. The shriek was so awful that Levin did not even jump up, but\\nholding his breath, gazed in terrified inquiry at the doctor. The\\ndoctor put his head on one side, listened, and smiled approvingly.\\nEverything was so extraordinary that nothing could strike Levin as\\nstrange. “I suppose it must be so,” he thought, and still sat where he\\nwas. Whose scream was this? He jumped up, ran on tiptoe to the bedroom,\\nedged round Lizaveta Petrovna and the princess, and took up his\\nposition at Kitty’s pillow. The scream had subsided, but there was some\\nchange now. What it was he did not see and did not comprehend, and he\\nhad no wish to see or comprehend. But he saw it by the face of Lizaveta\\nPetrovna. Lizaveta Petrovna’s face was stern and pale, and still as\\nresolute, though her jaws were twitching, and her eyes were fixed\\nintently on Kitty. Kitty’s swollen and agonized face, a tress of hair\\nclinging to her moist brow, was turned to him and sought his eyes. Her\\nlifted hands asked for his hands. Clutching his chill hands in her\\nmoist ones, she began squeezing them to her face.\\n\\n“Don’t go, don’t go! I’m not afraid, I’m not afraid!” she said rapidly.\\n“Mamma, take my earrings. They bother me. You’re not afraid? Quick,\\nquick, Lizaveta Petrovna....”\\n\\nShe spoke quickly, very quickly, and tried to smile. But suddenly her\\nface was drawn, she pushed him away.\\n\\n“Oh, this is awful! I’m dying, I’m dying! Go away!” she shrieked, and\\nagain he heard that unearthly scream.\\n\\nLevin clutched at his head and ran out of the room.\\n\\n“It’s nothing, it’s nothing, it’s all right,” Dolly called after him.\\n\\nBut they might say what they liked, he knew now that all was over. He\\nstood in the next room, his head leaning against the door post, and\\nheard shrieks, howls such as he had never heard before, and he knew\\nthat what had been Kitty was uttering these shrieks. He had long ago\\nceased to wish for the child. By now he loathed this child. He did not\\neven wish for her life now, all he longed for was the end of this awful\\nanguish.\\n\\n“Doctor! What is it? What is it? By God!” he said, snatching at the\\ndoctor’s hand as he came up.\\n\\n“It’s the end,” said the doctor. And the doctor’s face was so grave as\\nhe said it that Levin took _the end_ as meaning her death.\\n\\nBeside himself, he ran into the bedroom. The first thing he saw was the\\nface of Lizaveta Petrovna. It was even more frowning and stern. Kitty’s\\nface he did not know. In the place where it had been was something that\\nwas fearful in its strained distortion and in the sounds that came from\\nit. He fell down with his head on the wooden framework of the bed,\\nfeeling that his heart was bursting. The awful scream never paused, it\\nbecame still more awful, and as though it had reached the utmost limit\\nof terror, suddenly it ceased. Levin could not believe his ears, but\\nthere could be no doubt; the scream had ceased and he heard a subdued\\nstir and bustle, and hurried breathing, and her voice, gasping, alive,\\ntender, and blissful, uttered softly, “It’s over!”\\n\\nHe lifted his head. With her hands hanging exhausted on the quilt,\\nlooking extraordinarily lovely and serene, she looked at him in silence\\nand tried to smile, and could not.\\n\\nAnd suddenly, from the mysterious and awful far-away world in which he\\nhad been living for the last twenty-two hours, Levin felt himself all\\nin an instant borne back to the old every-day world, glorified though\\nnow, by such a radiance of happiness that he could not bear it. The\\nstrained chords snapped, sobs and tears of joy which he had never\\nforeseen rose up with such violence that his whole body shook, that for\\nlong they prevented him from speaking.\\n\\nFalling on his knees before the bed, he held his wife’s hand before his\\nlips and kissed it, and the hand, with a weak movement of the fingers,\\nresponded to his kiss. And meanwhile, there at the foot of the bed, in\\nthe deft hands of Lizaveta Petrovna, like a flickering light in a lamp,\\nlay the life of a human creature, which had never existed before, and\\nwhich would now with the same right, with the same importance to\\nitself, live and create in its own image.\\n\\n“Alive! alive! And a boy too! Set your mind at rest!” Levin heard\\nLizaveta Petrovna saying, as she slapped the baby’s back with a shaking\\nhand.\\n\\n“Mamma, is it true?” said Kitty’s voice.\\n\\nThe princess’s sobs were all the answers she could make. And in the\\nmidst of the silence there came in unmistakable reply to the mother’s\\nquestion, a voice quite unlike the subdued voices speaking in the room.\\nIt was the bold, clamorous, self-assertive squall of the new human\\nbeing, who had so incomprehensibly appeared.\\n\\nIf Levin had been told before that Kitty was dead, and that he had died\\nwith her, and that their children were angels, and that God was\\nstanding before him, he would have been surprised at nothing. But now,\\ncoming back to the world of reality, he had to make great mental\\nefforts to take in that she was alive and well, and that the creature\\nsqualling so desperately was his son. Kitty was alive, her agony was\\nover. And he was unutterably happy. That he understood; he was\\ncompletely happy in it. But the baby? Whence, why, who was he?... He\\ncould not get used to the idea. It seemed to him something extraneous,\\nsuperfluous, to which he could not accustom himself 16\\n\\nAt ten o’clock the old prince, Sergey Ivanovitch, and Stepan\\nArkadyevitch were sitting at Levin’s. Having inquired after Kitty, they\\nhad dropped into conversation upon other subjects. Levin heard them,\\nand unconsciously, as they talked, going over the past, over what had\\nbeen up to that morning, he thought of himself as he had been yesterday\\ntill that point. It was as though a hundred years had passed since\\nthen. He felt himself exalted to unattainable heights, from which he\\nstudiously lowered himself so as not to wound the people he was talking\\nto. He talked, and was all the time thinking of his wife, of her\\ncondition now, of his son, in whose existence he tried to school\\nhimself into believing. The whole world of woman, which had taken for\\nhim since his marriage a new value he had never suspected before, was\\nnow so exalted that he could not take it in in his imagination. He\\nheard them talk of yesterday’s dinner at the club, and thought: “What\\nis happening with her now? Is she asleep? How is she? What is she\\nthinking of? Is he crying, my son Dmitri?” And in the middle of the\\nconversation, in the middle of a sentence, he jumped up and went out of\\nthe room.\\n\\n“Send me word if I can see her,” said the prince.\\n\\n“Very well, in a minute,” answered Levin, and without stopping, he went\\nto her room.\\n\\nShe was not asleep, she was talking gently with her mother, making\\nplans about the christening.\\n\\nCarefully set to rights, with hair well-brushed, in a smart little cap\\nwith some blue in it, her arms out on the quilt, she was lying on her\\nback. Meeting his eyes, her eyes drew him to her. Her face, bright\\nbefore, brightened still more as he drew near her. There was the same\\nchange in it from earthly to unearthly that is seen in the face of the\\ndead. But then it means farewell, here it meant welcome. Again a rush\\nof emotion, such as he had felt at the moment of the child’s birth,\\nflooded his heart. She took his hand and asked him if he had slept. He\\ncould not answer, and turned away, struggling with his weakness.\\n\\n“I have had a nap, Kostya!” she said to him; “and I am so comfortable\\nnow.”\\n\\nShe looked at him, but suddenly her expression changed.\\n\\n“Give him to me,” she said, hearing the baby’s cry. “Give him to me,\\nLizaveta Petrovna, and he shall look at him.”\\n\\n“To be sure, his papa shall look at him,” said Lizaveta Petrovna,\\ngetting up and bringing something red, and queer, and wriggling. “Wait\\na minute, we’ll make him tidy first,” and Lizaveta Petrovna laid the\\nred wobbling thing on the bed, began untrussing and trussing up the\\nbaby, lifting it up and turning it over with one finger and powdering\\nit with something.\\n\\nLevin, looking at the tiny, pitiful creature, made strenuous efforts to\\ndiscover in his heart some traces of fatherly feeling for it. He felt\\nnothing towards it but disgust. But when it was undressed and he caught\\na glimpse of wee, wee, little hands, little feet, saffron-colored, with\\nlittle toes, too, and positively with a little big toe different from\\nthe rest, and when he saw Lizaveta Petrovna closing the wide-open\\nlittle hands, as though they were soft springs, and putting them into\\nlinen garments, such pity for the little creature came upon him, and\\nsuch terror that she would hurt it, that he held her hand back.\\n\\nLizaveta Petrovna laughed.\\n\\n“Don’t be frightened, don’t be frightened!”\\n\\nWhen the baby had been put to rights and transformed into a firm doll,\\nLizaveta Petrovna dandled it as though proud of her handiwork, and\\nstood a little away so that Levin might see his son in all his glory.\\n\\nKitty looked sideways in the same direction, never taking her eyes off\\nthe baby. “Give him to me! give him to me!” she said, and even made as\\nthough she would sit up.\\n\\n“What are you thinking of, Katerina Alexandrovna, you mustn’t move like\\nthat! Wait a minute. I’ll give him to you. Here we’re showing papa what\\na fine fellow we are!”\\n\\nAnd Lizaveta Petrovna, with one hand supporting the wobbling head,\\nlifted up on the other arm the strange, limp, red creature, whose head\\nwas lost in its swaddling clothes. But it had a nose, too, and slanting\\neyes and smacking lips.\\n\\n“A splendid baby!” said Lizaveta Petrovna.\\n\\nLevin sighed with mortification. This splendid baby excited in him no\\nfeeling but disgust and compassion. It was not at all the feeling he\\nhad looked forward to.\\n\\nHe turned away while Lizaveta Petrovna put the baby to the unaccustomed\\nbreast.\\n\\nSuddenly laughter made him look round. The baby had taken the breast.\\n\\n“Come, that’s enough, that’s enough!” said Lizaveta Petrovna, but Kitty\\nwould not let the baby go. He fell asleep in her arms.\\n\\n“Look, now,” said Kitty, turning the baby so that he could see it. The\\naged-looking little face suddenly puckered up still more and the baby\\nsneezed.\\n\\nSmiling, hardly able to restrain his tears, Levin kissed his wife and\\nwent out of the dark room. What he felt towards this little creature\\nwas utterly unlike what he had expected. There was nothing cheerful and\\njoyous in the feeling; on the contrary, it was a new torture of\\napprehension. It was the consciousness of a new sphere of liability to\\npain. And this sense was so painful at first, the apprehension lest\\nthis helpless creature should suffer was so intense, that it prevented\\nhim from noticing the strange thrill of senseless joy and even pride\\nthat he had felt when the baby sneezed 17\\n\\nStepan Arkadyevitch’s affairs were in a very bad way.\\n\\nThe money for two-thirds of the forest had all been spent already, and\\nhe had borrowed from the merchant in advance at ten per cent discount,\\nalmost all the remaining third. The merchant would not give more,\\nespecially as Darya Alexandrovna, for the first time that winter\\ninsisting on her right to her own property, had refused to sign the\\nreceipt for the payment of the last third of the forest. All his salary\\nwent on household expenses and in payment of petty debts that could not\\nbe put off. There was positively no money.\\n\\nThis was unpleasant and awkward, and in Stepan Arkadyevitch’s opinion\\nthings could not go on like this. The explanation of the position was,\\nin his view, to be found in the fact that his salary was too small. The\\npost he filled had been unmistakably very good five years ago, but it\\nwas so no longer.\\n\\nPetrov, the bank director, had twelve thousand; Sventitsky, a company\\ndirector, had seventeen thousand; Mitin, who had founded a bank,\\nreceived fifty thousand.\\n\\n“Clearly I’ve been napping, and they’ve overlooked me,” Stepan\\nArkadyevitch thought about himself. And he began keeping his eyes and\\nears open, and towards the end of the winter he had discovered a very\\ngood berth and had formed a plan of attack upon it, at first from\\nMoscow through aunts, uncles, and friends, and then, when the matter\\nwas well advanced, in the spring, he went himself to Petersburg. It was\\none of those snug, lucrative berths of which there are so many more\\nnowadays than there used to be, with incomes ranging from one thousand\\nto fifty thousand roubles. It was the post of secretary of the\\ncommittee of the amalgamated agency of the southern railways, and of\\ncertain banking companies. This position, like all such appointments,\\ncalled for such immense energy and such varied qualifications, that it\\nwas difficult for them to be found united in any one man. And since a\\nman combining all the qualifications was not to be found, it was at\\nleast better that the post be filled by an honest than by a dishonest\\nman. And Stepan Arkadyevitch was not merely an honest\\nman—unemphatically—in the common acceptation of the words, he was an\\nhonest man—emphatically—in that special sense which the word has in\\nMoscow, when they talk of an “honest” politician, an “honest” writer,\\nan “honest” newspaper, an “honest” institution, an “honest” tendency,\\nmeaning not simply that the man or the institution is not dishonest,\\nbut that they are capable on occasion of taking a line of their own in\\nopposition to the authorities.\\n\\nStepan Arkadyevitch moved in those circles in Moscow in which that\\nexpression had come into use, was regarded there as an honest man, and\\nso had more right to this appointment than others.\\n\\nThe appointment yielded an income of from seven to ten thousand a year,\\nand Oblonsky could fill it without giving up his government position.\\nIt was in the hands of two ministers, one lady, and two Jews, and all\\nthese people, though the way had been paved already with them, Stepan\\nArkadyevitch had to see in Petersburg. Besides this business, Stepan\\nArkadyevitch had promised his sister Anna to obtain from Karenin a\\ndefinite answer on the question of divorce. And begging fifty roubles\\nfrom Dolly, he set off for Petersburg.\\n\\nStepan Arkadyevitch sat in Karenin’s study listening to his report on\\nthe causes of the unsatisfactory position of Russian finance, and only\\nwaiting for the moment when he would finish to speak about his own\\nbusiness or about Anna.\\n\\n“Yes, that’s very true,” he said, when Alexey Alexandrovitch took off\\nthe pince-nez, without which he could not read now, and looked\\ninquiringly at his former brother-in-law, “that’s very true in\\nparticular cases, but still the principle of our day is freedom.”\\n\\n“Yes, but I lay down another principle, embracing the principle of\\nfreedom,” said Alexey Alexandrovitch, with emphasis on the word\\n“embracing,” and he put on his pince-nez again, so as to read the\\npassage in which this statement was made. And turning over the\\nbeautifully written, wide-margined manuscript, Alexey Alexandrovitch\\nread aloud over again the conclusive passage.\\n\\n“I don’t advocate protection for the sake of private interests, but for\\nthe public weal, and for the lower and upper classes equally,” he said,\\nlooking over his pince-nez at Oblonsky. “But _they_ cannot grasp that,\\n_they_ are taken up now with personal interests, and carried away by\\nphrases.”\\n\\nStepan Arkadyevitch knew that when Karenin began to talk of what _they_\\nwere doing and thinking, the persons who would not accept his report\\nand were the cause of everything wrong in Russia, that it was coming\\nnear the end. And so now he eagerly abandoned the principle of\\nfree-trade, and fully agreed. Alexey Alexandrovitch paused,\\nthoughtfully turning over the pages of his manuscript.\\n\\n“Oh, by the way,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, “I wanted to ask you, some\\ntime when you see Pomorsky, to drop him a hint that I should be very\\nglad to get that new appointment of secretary of the committee of the\\namalgamated agency of the southern railways and banking companies.”\\nStepan Arkadyevitch was familiar by now with the title of the post he\\ncoveted, and he brought it out rapidly without mistake.\\n\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch questioned him as to the duties of this new\\ncommittee, and pondered. He was considering whether the new committee\\nwould not be acting in some way contrary to the views he had been\\nadvocating. But as the influence of the new committee was of a very\\ncomplex nature, and his views were of very wide application, he could\\nnot decide this straight off, and taking off his pince-nez, he said:\\n\\n“Of course, I can mention it to him; but what is your reason precisely\\nfor wishing to obtain the appointment?”\\n\\n“It’s a good salary, rising to nine thousand, and my means....”\\n\\n“Nine thousand!” repeated Alexey Alexandrovitch, and he frowned. The\\nhigh figure of the salary made him reflect that on that side Stepan\\nArkadyevitch’s proposed position ran counter to the main tendency of\\nhis own projects of reform, which always leaned towards economy.\\n\\n“I consider, and I have embodied my views in a note on the subject,\\nthat in our day these immense salaries are evidence of the unsound\\neconomic _assiette_ of our finances.”\\n\\n“But what’s to be done?” said Stepan Arkadyevitch. “Suppose a bank\\ndirector gets ten thousand—well, he’s worth it; or an engineer gets\\ntwenty thousand—after all, it’s a growing thing, you know!”\\n\\n“I assume that a salary is the price paid for a commodity, and it ought\\nto conform with the law of supply and demand. If the salary is fixed\\nwithout any regard for that law, as, for instance, when I see two\\nengineers leaving college together, both equally well trained and\\nefficient, and one getting forty thousand while the other is satisfied\\nwith two; or when I see lawyers and hussars, having no special\\nqualifications, appointed directors of banking companies with immense\\nsalaries, I conclude that the salary is not fixed in accordance with\\nthe law of supply and demand, but simply through personal interest. And\\nthis is an abuse of great gravity in itself, and one that reacts\\ninjuriously on the government service. I consider....”\\n\\nStepan Arkadyevitch made haste to interrupt his brother-in-law.\\n\\n“Yes; but you must agree that it’s a new institution of undoubted\\nutility that’s being started. After all, you know, it’s a growing\\nthing! What they lay particular stress on is the thing being carried on\\nhonestly,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch with emphasis.\\n\\nBut the Moscow significance of the word “honest” was lost on Alexey\\nAlexandrovitch.\\n\\n“Honesty is only a negative qualification,” he said.\\n\\n“Well, you’ll do me a great service, anyway,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch,\\n“by putting in a word to Pomorsky—just in the way of conversation....”\\n\\n“But I fancy it’s more in Volgarinov’s hands,” said Alexey\\nAlexandrovitch.\\n\\n“Volgarinov has fully assented, as far as he’s concerned,” said Stepan\\nArkadyevitch, turning red. Stepan Arkadyevitch reddened at the mention\\nof that name, because he had been that morning at the Jew Volgarinov’s,\\nand the visit had left an unpleasant recollection.\\n\\nStepan Arkadyevitch believed most positively that the committee in\\nwhich he was trying to get an appointment was a new, genuine, and\\nhonest public body, but that morning when Volgarinov had—intentionally,\\nbeyond a doubt—kept him two hours waiting with other petitioners in his\\nwaiting room, he had suddenly felt uneasy.\\n\\nWhether he was uncomfortable that he, a descendant of Rurik, Prince\\nOblonsky, had been kept for two hours waiting to see a Jew, or that for\\nthe first time in his life he was not following the example of his\\nancestors in serving the government, but was turning off into a new\\ncareer, anyway he was very uncomfortable. During those two hours in\\nVolgarinov’s waiting room Stepan Arkadyevitch, stepping jauntily about\\nthe room, pulling his whiskers, entering into conversation with the\\nother petitioners, and inventing an epigram on his position,\\nassiduously concealed from others, and even from himself, the feeling\\nhe was experiencing.\\n\\nBut all the time he was uncomfortable and angry, he could not have said\\nwhy—whether because he could not get his epigram just right, or from\\nsome other reason. When at last Volgarinov had received him with\\nexaggerated politeness and unmistakable triumph at his humiliation, and\\nhad all but refused the favor asked of him, Stepan Arkadyevitch had\\nmade haste to forget it all as soon as possible. And now, at the mere\\nrecollection, he blushed 18\\n\\n“Now there is something I want to talk about, and you know what it is.\\nAbout Anna,” Stepan Arkadyevitch said, pausing for a brief space, and\\nshaking off the unpleasant impression.\\n\\nAs soon as Oblonsky uttered Anna’s name, the face of Alexey\\nAlexandrovitch was completely transformed; all the life was gone out of\\nit, and it looked weary and dead.\\n\\n“What is it exactly that you want from me?” he said, moving in his\\nchair and snapping his pince-nez.\\n\\n“A definite settlement, Alexey Alexandrovitch, some settlement of the\\nposition. I’m appealing to you” (“not as an injured husband,” Stepan\\nArkadyevitch was going to say, but afraid of wrecking his negotiation\\nby this, he changed the words) “not as a statesman” (which did not\\nsound _à propos_), “but simply as a man, and a good-hearted man and a\\nChristian. You must have pity on her,” he said.\\n\\n“That is, in what way precisely?” Karenin said softly.\\n\\n“Yes, pity on her. If you had seen her as I have!—I have been spending\\nall the winter with her—you would have pity on her. Her position is\\nawful, simply awful!”\\n\\n“I had imagined,” answered Alexey Alexandrovitch in a higher, almost\\nshrill voice, “that Anna Arkadyevna had everything she had desired for\\nherself.”\\n\\n“Oh, Alexey Alexandrovitch, for heaven’s sake, don’t let us indulge in\\nrecriminations! What is past is past, and you know what she wants and\\nis waiting for—divorce.”\\n\\n“But I believe Anna Arkadyevna refuses a divorce, if I make it a\\ncondition to leave me my son. I replied in that sense, and supposed\\nthat the matter was ended. I consider it at an end,” shrieked Alexey\\nAlexandrovitch.\\n\\n“But, for heaven’s sake, don’t get hot!” said Stepan Arkadyevitch,\\ntouching his brother-in-law’s knee. “The matter is not ended. If you\\nwill allow me to recapitulate, it was like this: when you parted, you\\nwere as magnanimous as could possibly be; you were ready to give her\\neverything—freedom, divorce even. She appreciated that. No, don’t think\\nthat. She did appreciate it—to such a degree that at the first moment,\\nfeeling how she had wronged you, she did not consider and could not\\nconsider everything. She gave up everything. But experience, time, have\\nshown that her position is unbearable, impossible.”\\n\\n“The life of Anna Arkadyevna can have no interest for me,” Alexey\\nAlexandrovitch put in, lifting his eyebrows.\\n\\n“Allow me to disbelieve that,” Stepan Arkadyevitch replied gently. “Her\\nposition is intolerable for her, and of no benefit to anyone whatever.\\nShe has deserved it, you will say. She knows that and asks you for\\nnothing; she says plainly that she dare not ask you. But I, all of us,\\nher relatives, all who love her, beg you, entreat you. Why should she\\nsuffer? Who is any the better for it?”\\n\\n“Excuse me, you seem to put me in the position of the guilty party,”\\nobserved Alexey Alexandrovitch.\\n\\n“Oh, no, oh, no, not at all! please understand me,” said Stepan\\nArkadyevitch, touching his hand again, as though feeling sure this\\nphysical contact would soften his brother-in-law. “All I say is this:\\nher position is intolerable, and it might be alleviated by you, and you\\nwill lose nothing by it. I will arrange it all for you, so that you’ll\\nnot notice it. You did promise it, you know.”\\n\\n“The promise was given before. And I had supposed that the question of\\nmy son had settled the matter. Besides, I had hoped that Anna\\nArkadyevna had enough generosity....” Alexey Alexandrovitch articulated\\nwith difficulty, his lips twitching and his face white.\\n\\n“She leaves it all to your generosity. She begs, she implores one thing\\nof you—to extricate her from the impossible position in which she is\\nplaced. She does not ask for her son now. Alexey Alexandrovitch, you\\nare a good man. Put yourself in her position for a minute. The question\\nof divorce for her in her position is a question of life and death. If\\nyou had not promised it once, she would have reconciled herself to her\\nposition, she would have gone on living in the country. But you\\npromised it, and she wrote to you, and moved to Moscow. And here she’s\\nbeen for six months in Moscow, where every chance meeting cuts her to\\nthe heart, every day expecting an answer. Why, it’s like keeping a\\ncondemned criminal for six months with the rope round his neck,\\npromising him perhaps death, perhaps mercy. Have pity on her, and I\\nwill undertake to arrange everything. _Vos scrupules_....”\\n\\n“I am not talking about that, about that....” Alexey Alexandrovitch\\ninterrupted with disgust. “But, perhaps, I promised what I had no right\\nto promise.”\\n\\n“So you go back from your promise?”\\n\\n“I have never refused to do all that is possible, but I want time to\\nconsider how much of what I promised is possible.”\\n\\n“No, Alexey Alexandrovitch!” cried Oblonsky, jumping up, “I won’t\\nbelieve that! She’s unhappy as only an unhappy woman can be, and you\\ncannot refuse in such....”\\n\\n“As much of what I promised as is possible. _Vous professez d’être\\nlibre penseur._ But I as a believer cannot, in a matter of such\\ngravity, act in opposition to the Christian law.”\\n\\n“But in Christian societies and among us, as far as I’m aware, divorce\\nis allowed,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch. “Divorce is sanctioned even by\\nour church. And we see....”\\n\\n“It is allowed, but not in the sense....”\\n\\n“Alexey Alexandrovitch, you are not like yourself,” said Oblonsky,\\nafter a brief pause. “Wasn’t it you (and didn’t we all appreciate it in\\nyou?) who forgave everything, and moved simply by Christian feeling was\\nready to make any sacrifice? You said yourself: if a man take thy coat,\\ngive him thy cloak also, and now....”\\n\\n“I beg,” said Alexey Alexandrovitch shrilly, getting suddenly onto his\\nfeet, his face white and his jaws twitching, “I beg you to drop this\\n... to drop ... this subject!”\\n\\n“Oh, no! Oh, forgive me, forgive me if I have wounded you,” said Stepan\\nArkadyevitch, holding out his hand with a smile of embarrassment; “but\\nlike a messenger I have simply performed the commission given me.”\\n\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch gave him his hand, pondered a little, and said:\\n\\n“I must think it over and seek for guidance. The day after tomorrow I\\nwill give you a final answer,” he said, after considering a moment 19\\n\\nStepan Arkadyevitch was about to go away when Korney came in to\\nannounce:\\n\\n“Sergey Alexyevitch!”\\n\\n“Who’s Sergey Alexyevitch?” Stepan Arkadyevitch was beginning, but he\\nremembered immediately.\\n\\n“Ah, Seryozha!” he said aloud. “Sergey Alexyevitch! I thought it was\\nthe director of a department. Anna asked me to see him too,” he\\nthought.\\n\\nAnd he recalled the timid, piteous expression with which Anna had said\\nto him at parting: “Anyway, you will see him. Find out exactly where he\\nis, who is looking after him. And Stiva ... if it were possible! Could\\nit be possible?” Stepan Arkadyevitch knew what was meant by that “if it\\nwere possible,”—if it were possible to arrange the divorce so as to let\\nher have her son.... Stepan Arkadyevitch saw now that it was no good to\\ndream of that, but still he was glad to see his nephew.\\n\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch reminded his brother-in-law that they never spoke\\nto the boy of his mother, and he begged him not to mention a single\\nword about her.\\n\\n“He was very ill after that interview with his mother, which we had not\\nforeseen,” said Alexey Alexandrovitch. “Indeed, we feared for his life.\\nBut with rational treatment, and sea-bathing in the summer, he regained\\nhis strength, and now, by the doctor’s advice, I have let him go to\\nschool. And certainly the companionship of school has had a good effect\\non him, and he is perfectly well, and making good progress.”\\n\\n“What a fine fellow he’s grown! He’s not Seryozha now, but quite\\nfull-fledged Sergey Alexyevitch!” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, smiling, as\\nhe looked at the handsome, broad-shouldered lad in blue coat and long\\ntrousers, who walked in alertly and confidently. The boy looked healthy\\nand good-humored. He bowed to his uncle as to a stranger, but\\nrecognizing him, he blushed and turned hurriedly away from him, as\\nthough offended and irritated at something. The boy went up to his\\nfather and handed him a note of the marks he had gained in school.\\n\\n“Well, that’s very fair,” said his father, “you can go.”\\n\\n“He’s thinner and taller, and has grown out of being a child into a\\nboy; I like that,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch. “Do you remember me?”\\n\\nThe boy looked back quickly at his uncle.\\n\\n“Yes, _mon oncle_,” he answered, glancing at his father, and again he\\nlooked downcast.\\n\\nHis uncle called him to him, and took his hand.\\n\\n“Well, and how are you getting on?” he said, wanting to talk to him,\\nand not knowing what to say.\\n\\nThe boy, blushing and making no answer, cautiously drew his hand away.\\nAs soon as Stepan Arkadyevitch let go his hand, he glanced doubtfully\\nat his father, and like a bird set free, he darted out of the room.\\n\\nA year had passed since the last time Seryozha had seen his mother.\\nSince then he had heard nothing more of her. And in the course of that\\nyear he had gone to school, and made friends among his schoolfellows.\\nThe dreams and memories of his mother, which had made him ill after\\nseeing her, did not occupy his thoughts now. When they came back to\\nhim, he studiously drove them away, regarding them as shameful and\\ngirlish, below the dignity of a boy and a schoolboy. He knew that his\\nfather and mother were separated by some quarrel, he knew that he had\\nto remain with his father, and he tried to get used to that idea.\\n\\nHe disliked seeing his uncle, so like his mother, for it called up\\nthose memories of which he was ashamed. He disliked it all the more as\\nfrom some words he had caught as he waited at the study door, and still\\nmore from the faces of his father and uncle, he guessed that they must\\nhave been talking of his mother. And to avoid condemning the father\\nwith whom he lived and on whom he was dependent, and, above all, to\\navoid giving way to sentimentality, which he considered so degrading,\\nSeryozha tried not to look at his uncle who had come to disturb his\\npeace of mind, and not to think of what he recalled to him.\\n\\nBut when Stepan Arkadyevitch, going out after him, saw him on the\\nstairs, and calling to him, asked him how he spent his playtime at\\nschool, Seryozha talked more freely to him away from his father’s\\npresence.\\n\\n“We have a railway now,” he said in answer to his uncle’s question.\\n“It’s like this, do you see: two sit on a bench—they’re the passengers;\\nand one stands up straight on the bench. And all are harnessed to it by\\ntheir arms or by their belts, and they run through all the rooms—the\\ndoors are left open beforehand. Well, and it’s pretty hard work being\\nthe conductor!”\\n\\n“That’s the one that stands?” Stepan Arkadyevitch inquired, smiling.\\n\\n“Yes, you want pluck for it, and cleverness too, especially when they\\nstop all of a sudden, or someone falls down.”\\n\\n“Yes, that must be a serious matter,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch,\\nwatching with mournful interest the eager eyes, like his mother’s; not\\nchildish now—no longer fully innocent. And though he had promised\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch not to speak of Anna, he could not restrain\\nhimself.\\n\\n“Do you remember your mother?” he asked suddenly.\\n\\n“No, I don’t,” Seryozha said quickly. He blushed crimson, and his face\\nclouded over. And his uncle could get nothing more out of him. His\\ntutor found his pupil on the staircase half an hour later, and for a\\nlong while he could not make out whether he was ill-tempered or crying.\\n\\n“What is it? I expect you hurt yourself when you fell down?” said the\\ntutor. “I told you it was a dangerous game. And we shall have to speak\\nto the director.”\\n\\n“If I had hurt myself, nobody should have found it out, that’s\\ncertain.”\\n\\n“Well, what is it, then?”\\n\\n“Leave me alone! If I remember, or if I don’t remember?... what\\nbusiness is it of his? Why should I remember? Leave me in peace!” he\\nsaid, addressing not his tutor, but the whole world 20\\n\\nStepan Arkadyevitch, as usual, did not waste his time in Petersburg. In\\nPetersburg, besides business, his sister’s divorce, and his coveted\\nappointment, he wanted, as he always did, to freshen himself up, as he\\nsaid, after the mustiness of Moscow.\\n\\nIn spite of its _cafés chantants_ and its omnibuses, Moscow was yet a\\nstagnant bog. Stepan Arkadyevitch always felt it. After living for some\\ntime in Moscow, especially in close relations with his family, he was\\nconscious of a depression of spirits. After being a long time in Moscow\\nwithout a change, he reached a point when he positively began to be\\nworrying himself over his wife’s ill-humor and reproaches, over his\\nchildren’s health and education, and the petty details of his official\\nwork; even the fact of being in debt worried him. But he had only to go\\nand stay a little while in Petersburg, in the circle there in which he\\nmoved, where people lived—really lived—instead of vegetating as in\\nMoscow, and all such ideas vanished and melted away at once, like wax\\nbefore the fire. His wife?... Only that day he had been talking to\\nPrince Tchetchensky. Prince Tchetchensky had a wife and family,\\ngrown-up pages in the corps, ... and he had another illegitimate family\\nof children also. Though the first family was very nice too, Prince\\nTchetchensky felt happier in his second family; and he used to take his\\neldest son with him to his second family, and told Stepan Arkadyevitch\\nthat he thought it good for his son, enlarging his ideas. What would\\nhave been said to that in Moscow?\\n\\nHis children? In Petersburg children did not prevent their parents from\\nenjoying life. The children were brought up in schools, and there was\\nno trace of the wild idea that prevailed in Moscow, in Lvov’s\\nhousehold, for instance, that all the luxuries of life were for the\\nchildren, while the parents have nothing but work and anxiety. Here\\npeople understood that a man is in duty bound to live for himself, as\\nevery man of culture should live.\\n\\nHis official duties? Official work here was not the stiff, hopeless\\ndrudgery that it was in Moscow. Here there was some interest in\\nofficial life. A chance meeting, a service rendered, a happy phrase, a\\nknack of facetious mimicry, and a man’s career might be made in a\\ntrice. So it had been with Bryantsev, whom Stepan Arkadyevitch had met\\nthe previous day, and who was one of the highest functionaries in\\ngovernment now. There was some interest in official work like that.\\n\\nThe Petersburg attitude on pecuniary matters had an especially soothing\\neffect on Stepan Arkadyevitch. Bartnyansky, who must spend at least\\nfifty thousand to judge by the style he lived in, had made an\\ninteresting comment the day before on that subject.\\n\\nAs they were talking before dinner, Stepan Arkadyevitch said to\\nBartnyansky:\\n\\n“You’re friendly, I fancy, with Mordvinsky; you might do me a favor:\\nsay a word to him, please, for me. There’s an appointment I should like\\nto get—secretary of the agency....”\\n\\n“Oh, I shan’t remember all that, if you tell it to me.... But what\\npossesses you to have to do with railways and Jews?... Take it as you\\nwill, it’s a low business.”\\n\\nStepan Arkadyevitch did not say to Bartnyansky that it was a “growing\\nthing”—Bartnyansky would not have understood that.\\n\\n“I want the money, I’ve nothing to live on.”\\n\\n“You’re living, aren’t you?”\\n\\n“Yes, but in debt.”\\n\\n“Are you, though? Heavily?” said Bartnyansky sympathetically.\\n\\n“Very heavily: twenty thousand.”\\n\\nBartnyansky broke into good-humored laughter.\\n\\n“Oh, lucky fellow!” said he. “My debts mount up to a million and a\\nhalf, and I’ve nothing, and still I can live, as you see!”\\n\\nAnd Stepan Arkadyevitch saw the correctness of this view not in words\\nonly but in actual fact. Zhivahov owed three hundred thousand, and\\nhadn’t a farthing to bless himself with, and he lived, and in style\\ntoo! Count Krivtsov was considered a hopeless case by everyone, and yet\\nhe kept two mistresses. Petrovsky had run through five millions, and\\nstill lived in just the same style, and was even a manager in the\\nfinancial department with a salary of twenty thousand. But besides\\nthis, Petersburg had physically an agreeable effect on Stepan\\nArkadyevitch. It made him younger. In Moscow he sometimes found a gray\\nhair in his head, dropped asleep after dinner, stretched, walked slowly\\nupstairs, breathing heavily, was bored by the society of young women,\\nand did not dance at balls. In Petersburg he always felt ten years\\nyounger.\\n\\nHis experience in Petersburg was exactly what had been described to him\\non the previous day by Prince Pyotr Oblonsky, a man of sixty, who had\\njust come back from abroad:\\n\\n“We don’t know the way to live here,” said Pyotr Oblonsky. “I spent the\\nsummer in Baden, and you wouldn’t believe it, I felt quite a young man.\\nAt a glimpse of a pretty woman, my thoughts.... One dines and drinks a\\nglass of wine, and feels strong and ready for anything. I came home to\\nRussia—had to see my wife, and, what’s more, go to my country place;\\nand there, you’d hardly believe it, in a fortnight I’d got into a\\ndressing gown and given up dressing for dinner. Needn’t say I had no\\nthoughts left for pretty women. I became quite an old gentleman. There\\nwas nothing left for me but to think of my eternal salvation. I went\\noff to Paris—I was as right as could be at once.”\\n\\nStepan Arkadyevitch felt exactly the difference that Pyotr Oblonsky\\ndescribed. In Moscow he degenerated so much that if he had had to be\\nthere for long together, he might in good earnest have come to\\nconsidering his salvation; in Petersburg he felt himself a man of the\\nworld again.\\n\\nBetween Princess Betsy Tverskaya and Stepan Arkadyevitch there had long\\nexisted rather curious relations. Stepan Arkadyevitch always flirted\\nwith her in jest, and used to say to her, also in jest, the most\\nunseemly things, knowing that nothing delighted her so much. The day\\nafter his conversation with Karenin, Stepan Arkadyevitch went to see\\nher, and felt so youthful that in this jesting flirtation and nonsense\\nhe recklessly went so far that he did not know how to extricate\\nhimself, as unluckily he was so far from being attracted by her that he\\nthought her positively disagreeable. What made it hard to change the\\nconversation was the fact that he was very attractive to her. So that\\nhe was considerably relieved at the arrival of Princess Myakaya, which\\ncut short their _tête-à-tête_.\\n\\n“Ah, so you’re here!” said she when she saw him. “Well, and what news\\nof your poor sister? You needn’t look at me like that,” she added.\\n“Ever since they’ve all turned against her, all those who’re a thousand\\ntimes worse than she, I’ve thought she did a very fine thing. I can’t\\nforgive Vronsky for not letting me know when she was in Petersburg. I’d\\nhave gone to see her and gone about with her everywhere. Please give\\nher my love. Come, tell me about her.”\\n\\n“Yes, her position is very difficult; she....” began Stepan\\nArkadyevitch, in the simplicity of his heart accepting as sterling coin\\nPrincess Myakaya’s words “tell me about her.” Princess Myakaya\\ninterrupted him immediately, as she always did, and began talking\\nherself.\\n\\n“She’s done what they all do, except me—only they hide it. But she\\nwouldn’t be deceitful, and she did a fine thing. And she did better\\nstill in throwing up that crazy brother-in-law of yours. You must\\nexcuse me. Everybody used to say he was so clever, so very clever; I\\nwas the only one that said he was a fool. Now that he’s so thick with\\nLidia Ivanovna and Landau, they all say he’s crazy, and I should prefer\\nnot to agree with everybody, but this time I can’t help it.”\\n\\n“Oh, do please explain,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch; “what does it mean?\\nYesterday I was seeing him on my sister’s behalf, and I asked him to\\ngive me a final answer. He gave me no answer, and said he would think\\nit over. But this morning, instead of an answer, I received an\\ninvitation from Countess Lidia Ivanovna for this evening.”\\n\\n“Ah, so that’s it, that’s it!” said Princess Myakaya gleefully,\\n“they’re going to ask Landau what he’s to say.”\\n\\n“Ask Landau? What for? Who or what’s Landau?”\\n\\n“What! you don’t know Jules Landau, _le fameux Jules Landau, le\\nclairvoyant_? He’s crazy too, but on him your sister’s fate depends.\\nSee what comes of living in the provinces—you know nothing about\\nanything. Landau, do you see, was a _commis_ in a shop in Paris, and he\\nwent to a doctor’s; and in the doctor’s waiting room he fell asleep,\\nand in his sleep he began giving advice to all the patients. And\\nwonderful advice it was! Then the wife of Yury Meledinsky—you know, the\\ninvalid?—heard of this Landau, and had him to see her husband. And he\\ncured her husband, though I can’t say that I see he did him much good,\\nfor he’s just as feeble a creature as ever he was, but they believed in\\nhim, and took him along with them and brought him to Russia. Here\\nthere’s been a general rush to him, and he’s begun doctoring everyone.\\nHe cured Countess Bezzubova, and she took such a fancy to him that she\\nadopted him.”\\n\\n“Adopted him?”\\n\\n“Yes, as her son. He’s not Landau any more now, but Count Bezzubov.\\nThat’s neither here nor there, though; but Lidia—I’m very fond of her,\\nbut she has a screw loose somewhere—has lost her heart to this Landau\\nnow, and nothing is settled now in her house or Alexey Alexandrovitch’s\\nwithout him, and so your sister’s fate is now in the hands of Landau,\\n_alias_ Count Bezzubov 21\\n\\nAfter a capital dinner and a great deal of cognac drunk at\\nBartnyansky’s, Stepan Arkadyevitch, only a little later than the\\nappointed time, went in to Countess Lidia Ivanovna’s.\\n\\n“Who else is with the countess?—a Frenchman?” Stepan Arkadyevitch asked\\nthe hall-porter, as he glanced at the familiar overcoat of Alexey\\nAlexandrovitch and a queer, rather artless-looking overcoat with\\nclasps.\\n\\n“Alexey Alexandrovitch Karenin and Count Bezzubov,” the porter answered\\nseverely.\\n\\n“Princess Myakaya guessed right,” thought Stepan Arkadyevitch, as he\\nwent upstairs. “Curious! It would be quite as well, though, to get on\\nfriendly terms with her. She has immense influence. If she would say a\\nword to Pomorsky, the thing would be a certainty.”\\n\\nIt was still quite light out-of-doors, but in Countess Lidia Ivanovna’s\\nlittle drawing-room the blinds were drawn and the lamps lighted. At a\\nround table under a lamp sat the countess and Alexey Alexandrovitch,\\ntalking softly. A short, thinnish man, very pale and handsome, with\\nfeminine hips and knock-kneed legs, with fine brilliant eyes and long\\nhair lying on the collar of his coat, was standing at the end of the\\nroom gazing at the portraits on the wall. After greeting the lady of\\nthe house and Alexey Alexandrovitch, Stepan Arkadyevitch could not\\nresist glancing once more at the unknown man.\\n\\n“Monsieur Landau!” the countess addressed him with a softness and\\ncaution that impressed Oblonsky. And she introduced them.\\n\\nLandau looked round hurriedly, came up, and smiling, laid his moist,\\nlifeless hand in Stepan Arkadyevitch’s outstretched hand and\\nimmediately walked away and fell to gazing at the portraits again. The\\ncountess and Alexey Alexandrovitch looked at each other significantly.\\n\\n“I am very glad to see you, particularly today,” said Countess Lidia\\nIvanovna, pointing Stepan Arkadyevitch to a seat beside Karenin.\\n\\n“I introduced you to him as Landau,” she said in a soft voice, glancing\\nat the Frenchman and again immediately after at Alexey Alexandrovitch,\\n“but he is really Count Bezzubov, as you’re probably aware. Only he\\ndoes not like the title.”\\n\\n“Yes, I heard so,” answered Stepan Arkadyevitch; “they say he\\ncompletely cured Countess Bezzubova.”\\n\\n“She was here today, poor thing!” the countess said, turning to Alexey\\nAlexandrovitch. “This separation is awful for her. It’s such a blow to\\nher!”\\n\\n“And he positively is going?” queried Alexey Alexandrovitch.\\n\\n“Yes, he’s going to Paris. He heard a voice yesterday,” said Countess\\nLidia Ivanovna, looking at Stepan Arkadyevitch.\\n\\n“Ah, a voice!” repeated Oblonsky, feeling that he must be as\\ncircumspect as he possibly could in this society, where something\\npeculiar was going on, or was to go on, to which he had not the key.\\n\\nA moment’s silence followed, after which Countess Lidia Ivanovna, as\\nthough approaching the main topic of conversation, said with a fine\\nsmile to Oblonsky:\\n\\n“I’ve known you for a long while, and am very glad to make a closer\\nacquaintance with you. _Les amis de nos amis sont nos amis._ But to be\\na true friend, one must enter into the spiritual state of one’s friend,\\nand I fear that you are not doing so in the case of Alexey\\nAlexandrovitch. You understand what I mean?” she said, lifting her fine\\npensive eyes.\\n\\n“In part, countess, I understand the position of Alexey\\nAlexandrovitch....” said Oblonsky. Having no clear idea what they were\\ntalking about, he wanted to confine himself to generalities.\\n\\n“The change is not in his external position,” Countess Lidia Ivanovna\\nsaid sternly, following with eyes of love the figure of Alexey\\nAlexandrovitch as he got up and crossed over to Landau; “his heart is\\nchanged, a new heart has been vouchsafed him, and I fear you don’t\\nfully apprehend the change that has taken place in him.”\\n\\n“Oh, well, in general outlines I can conceive the change. We have\\nalways been friendly, and now....” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, responding\\nwith a sympathetic glance to the expression of the countess, and\\nmentally balancing the question with which of the two ministers she was\\nmost intimate, so as to know about which to ask her to speak for him.\\n\\n“The change that has taken place in him cannot lessen his love for his\\nneighbors; on the contrary, that change can only intensify love in his\\nheart. But I am afraid you do not understand me. Won’t you have some\\ntea?” she said, with her eyes indicating the footman, who was handing\\nround tea on a tray.\\n\\n“Not quite, countess. Of course, his misfortune....”\\n\\n“Yes, a misfortune which has proved the highest happiness, when his\\nheart was made new, was filled full of it,” she said, gazing with eyes\\nfull of love at Stepan Arkadyevitch.\\n\\n“I do believe I might ask her to speak to both of them,” thought Stepan\\nArkadyevitch.\\n\\n“Oh, of course, countess,” he said; “but I imagine such changes are a\\nmatter so private that no one, even the most intimate friend, would\\ncare to speak of them.”\\n\\n“On the contrary! We ought to speak freely and help one another.”\\n\\n“Yes, undoubtedly so, but there is such a difference of convictions,\\nand besides....” said Oblonsky with a soft smile.\\n\\n“There can be no difference where it is a question of holy truth.”\\n\\n“Oh, no, of course; but....” and Stepan Arkadyevitch paused in\\nconfusion. He understood at last that they were talking of religion.\\n\\n“I fancy he will fall asleep immediately,” said Alexey Alexandrovitch\\nin a whisper full of meaning, going up to Lidia Ivanovna.\\n\\nStepan Arkadyevitch looked round. Landau was sitting at the window,\\nleaning on his elbow and the back of his chair, his head drooping.\\nNoticing that all eyes were turned on him he raised his head and smiled\\na smile of childlike artlessness.\\n\\n“Don’t take any notice,” said Lidia Ivanovna, and she lightly moved a\\nchair up for Alexey Alexandrovitch. “I have observed....” she was\\nbeginning, when a footman came into the room with a letter. Lidia\\nIvanovna rapidly ran her eyes over the note, and excusing herself,\\nwrote an answer with extraordinary rapidity, handed it to the man, and\\ncame back to the table. “I have observed,” she went on, “that Moscow\\npeople, especially the men, are more indifferent to religion than\\nanyone.”\\n\\n“Oh, no, countess, I thought Moscow people had the reputation of being\\nthe firmest in the faith,” answered Stepan Arkadyevitch.\\n\\n“But as far as I can make out, you are unfortunately one of the\\nindifferent ones,” said Alexey Alexandrovitch, turning to him with a\\nweary smile.\\n\\n“How anyone can be indifferent!” said Lidia Ivanovna.\\n\\n“I am not so much indifferent on that subject as I am waiting in\\nsuspense,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, with his most deprecating smile.\\n“I hardly think that the time for such questions has come yet for me.”\\n\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch and Lidia Ivanovna looked at each other.\\n\\n“We can never tell whether the time has come for us or not,” said\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch severely. “We ought not to think whether we are\\nready or not ready. God’s grace is not guided by human considerations:\\nsometimes it comes not to those that strive for it, and comes to those\\nthat are unprepared, like Saul.”\\n\\n“No, I believe it won’t be just yet,” said Lidia Ivanovna, who had been\\nmeanwhile watching the movements of the Frenchman. Landau got up and\\ncame to them.\\n\\n“Do you allow me to listen?” he asked.\\n\\n“Oh, yes; I did not want to disturb you,” said Lidia Ivanovna, gazing\\ntenderly at him; “sit here with us.”\\n\\n“One has only not to close one’s eyes to shut out the light,” Alexey\\nAlexandrovitch went on.\\n\\n“Ah, if you knew the happiness we know, feeling His presence ever in\\nour hearts!” said Countess Lidia Ivanovna with a rapturous smile.\\n\\n“But a man may feel himself unworthy sometimes to rise to that height,”\\nsaid Stepan Arkadyevitch, conscious of hypocrisy in admitting this\\nreligious height, but at the same time unable to bring himself to\\nacknowledge his free-thinking views before a person who, by a single\\nword to Pomorsky, might procure him the coveted appointment.\\n\\n“That is, you mean that sin keeps him back?” said Lidia Ivanovna. “But\\nthat is a false idea. There is no sin for believers, their sin has been\\natoned for. _Pardon,_” she added, looking at the footman, who came in\\nagain with another letter. She read it and gave a verbal answer:\\n“Tomorrow at the Grand Duchess’s, say.” “For the believer sin is not,”\\nshe went on.\\n\\n“Yes, but faith without works is dead,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch,\\nrecalling the phrase from the catechism, and only by his smile clinging\\nto his independence.\\n\\n“There you have it—from the epistle of St. James,” said Alexey\\nAlexandrovitch, addressing Lidia Ivanovna, with a certain\\nreproachfulness in his tone. It was unmistakably a subject they had\\ndiscussed more than once before. “What harm has been done by the false\\ninterpretation of that passage! Nothing holds men back from belief like\\nthat misinterpretation. ‘I have not works, so I cannot believe,’ though\\nall the while that is not said. But the very opposite is said.”\\n\\n“Striving for God, saving the soul by fasting,” said Countess Lidia\\nIvanovna, with disgusted contempt, “those are the crude ideas of our\\nmonks.... Yet that is nowhere said. It is far simpler and easier,” she\\nadded, looking at Oblonsky with the same encouraging smile with which\\nat court she encouraged youthful maids of honor, disconcerted by the\\nnew surroundings of the court.\\n\\n“We are saved by Christ who suffered for us. We are saved by faith,”\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch chimed in, with a glance of approval at her\\nwords.\\n\\n_“Vous comprenez l’anglais?”_ asked Lidia Ivanovna, and receiving a\\nreply in the affirmative, she got up and began looking through a shelf\\nof books.\\n\\n“I want to read him ‘Safe and Happy,’ or ‘Under the Wing,’” she said,\\nlooking inquiringly at Karenin. And finding the book, and sitting down\\nagain in her place, she opened it. “It’s very short. In it is described\\nthe way by which faith can be reached, and the happiness, above all\\nearthly bliss, with which it fills the soul. The believer cannot be\\nunhappy because he is not alone. But you will see.” She was just\\nsettling herself to read when the footman came in again. “Madame\\nBorozdina? Tell her, tomorrow at two o’clock. Yes,” she said, putting\\nher finger in the place in the book, and gazing before her with her\\nfine pensive eyes, “that is how true faith acts. You know Marie Sanina?\\nYou know about her trouble? She lost her only child. She was in\\ndespair. And what happened? She found this comforter, and she thanks\\nGod now for the death of her child. Such is the happiness faith\\nbrings!”\\n\\n“Oh, yes, that is most....” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, glad they were\\ngoing to read, and let him have a chance to collect his faculties. “No,\\nI see I’d better not ask her about anything today,” he thought. “If\\nonly I can get out of this without putting my foot in it!”\\n\\n“It will be dull for you,” said Countess Lidia Ivanovna, addressing\\nLandau; “you don’t know English, but it’s short.”\\n\\n“Oh, I shall understand,” said Landau, with the same smile, and he\\nclosed his eyes. Alexey Alexandrovitch and Lidia Ivanovna exchanged\\nmeaningful glances, and the reading began 22\\n\\nStepan Arkadyevitch felt completely nonplussed by the strange talk\\nwhich he was hearing for the first time. The complexity of Petersburg,\\nas a rule, had a stimulating effect on him, rousing him out of his\\nMoscow stagnation. But he liked these complications, and understood\\nthem only in the circles he knew and was at home in. In these\\nunfamiliar surroundings he was puzzled and disconcerted, and could not\\nget his bearings. As he listened to Countess Lidia Ivanovna, aware of\\nthe beautiful, artless—or perhaps artful, he could not decide\\nwhich—eyes of Landau fixed upon him, Stepan Arkadyevitch began to be\\nconscious of a peculiar heaviness in his head.\\n\\nThe most incongruous ideas were in confusion in his head. “Marie Sanina\\nis glad her child’s dead.... How good a smoke would be now!... To be\\nsaved, one need only believe, and the monks don’t know how the thing’s\\nto be done, but Countess Lidia Ivanovna does know.... And why is my\\nhead so heavy? Is it the cognac, or all this being so queer? Anyway, I\\nfancy I’ve done nothing unsuitable so far. But anyway, it won’t do to\\nask her now. They say they make one say one’s prayers. I only hope they\\nwon’t make me! That’ll be too imbecile. And what stuff it is she’s\\nreading! but she has a good accent. Landau—Bezzubov—what’s he Bezzubov\\nfor?” All at once Stepan Arkadyevitch became aware that his lower jaw\\nwas uncontrollably forming a yawn. He pulled his whiskers to cover the\\nyawn, and shook himself together. But soon after he became aware that\\nhe was dropping asleep and on the very point of snoring. He recovered\\nhimself at the very moment when the voice of Countess Lidia Ivanovna\\nwas saying “he’s asleep.” Stepan Arkadyevitch started with dismay,\\nfeeling guilty and caught. But he was reassured at once by seeing that\\nthe words “he’s asleep” referred not to him, but to Landau. The\\nFrenchman was asleep as well as Stepan Arkadyevitch. But Stepan\\nArkadyevitch’s being asleep would have offended them, as he thought\\n(though even this, he thought, might not be so, as everything seemed so\\nqueer), while Landau’s being asleep delighted them extremely,\\nespecially Countess Lidia Ivanovna.\\n\\n_“Mon ami,”_ said Lidia Ivanovna, carefully holding the folds of her\\nsilk gown so as not to rustle, and in her excitement calling Karenin\\nnot Alexey Alexandrovitch, but _“mon ami,” “donnez-lui la main. Vous\\nvoyez?_ Sh!” she hissed at the footman as he came in again. “Not at\\nhome.”\\n\\nThe Frenchman was asleep, or pretending to be asleep, with his head on\\nthe back of his chair, and his moist hand, as it lay on his knee, made\\nfaint movements, as though trying to catch something. Alexey\\nAlexandrovitch got up, tried to move carefully, but stumbled against\\nthe table, went up and laid his hand in the Frenchman’s hand. Stepan\\nArkadyevitch got up too, and opening his eyes wide, trying to wake\\nhimself up if he were asleep, he looked first at one and then at the\\nother. It was all real. Stepan Arkadyevitch felt that his head was\\ngetting worse and worse.\\n\\n“_Que la personne qui est arrivée la dernière, celle qui demande,\\nqu’elle sorte! Qu’elle sorte!_” articulated the Frenchman, without\\nopening his eyes.\\n\\n“_Vous m’excuserez, mais vous voyez.... Revenez vers dix heures, encore\\nmieux demain._”\\n\\n“_Qu’elle sorte!_” repeated the Frenchman impatiently.\\n\\n“_C’est moi, n’est-ce pas?_” And receiving an answer in the\\naffirmative, Stepan Arkadyevitch, forgetting the favor he had meant to\\nask of Lidia Ivanovna, and forgetting his sister’s affairs, caring for\\nnothing, but filled with the sole desire to get away as soon as\\npossible, went out on tiptoe and ran out into the street as though from\\na plague-stricken house. For a long while he chatted and joked with his\\ncab-driver, trying to recover his spirits.\\n\\nAt the French theater where he arrived for the last act, and afterwards\\nat the Tatar restaurant after his champagne, Stepan Arkadyevitch felt a\\nlittle refreshed in the atmosphere he was used to. But still he felt\\nquite unlike himself all that evening.\\n\\nOn getting home to Pyotr Oblonsky’s, where he was staying, Stepan\\nArkadyevitch found a note from Betsy. She wrote to him that she was\\nvery anxious to finish their interrupted conversation, and begged him\\nto come next day. He had scarcely read this note, and frowned at its\\ncontents, when he heard below the ponderous tramp of the servants,\\ncarrying something heavy.\\n\\nStepan Arkadyevitch went out to look. It was the rejuvenated Pyotr\\nOblonsky. He was so drunk that he could not walk upstairs; but he told\\nthem to set him on his legs when he saw Stepan Arkadyevitch, and\\nclinging to him, walked with him into his room and there began telling\\nhim how he had spent the evening, and fell asleep doing so.\\n\\nStepan Arkadyevitch was in very low spirits, which happened rarely with\\nhim, and for a long while he could not go to sleep. Everything he could\\nrecall to his mind, everything was disgusting; but most disgusting of\\nall, as if it were something shameful, was the memory of the evening he\\nhad spent at Countess Lidia Ivanovna’s.\\n\\nNext day he received from Alexey Alexandrovitch a final answer,\\nrefusing to grant Anna’s divorce, and he understood that this decision\\nwas based on what the Frenchman had said in his real or pretended\\ntrance 23\\n\\nIn order to carry through any undertaking in family life, there must\\nnecessarily be either complete division between the husband and wife,\\nor loving agreement. When the relations of a couple are vacillating and\\nneither one thing nor the other, no sort of enterprise can be\\nundertaken.\\n\\nMany families remain for years in the same place, though both husband\\nand wife are sick of it, simply because there is neither complete\\ndivision nor agreement between them.\\n\\nBoth Vronsky and Anna felt life in Moscow insupportable in the heat and\\ndust, when the spring sunshine was followed by the glare of summer, and\\nall the trees in the boulevards had long since been in full leaf, and\\nthe leaves were covered with dust. But they did not go back to\\nVozdvizhenskoe, as they had arranged to do long before; they went on\\nstaying in Moscow, though they both loathed it, because of late there\\nhad been no agreement between them.\\n\\nThe irritability that kept them apart had no external cause, and all\\nefforts to come to an understanding intensified it, instead of removing\\nit. It was an inner irritation, grounded in her mind on the conviction\\nthat his love had grown less; in his, on regret that he had put himself\\nfor her sake in a difficult position, which she, instead of lightening,\\nmade still more difficult. Neither of them gave full utterance to their\\nsense of grievance, but they considered each other in the wrong, and\\ntried on every pretext to prove this to one another.\\n\\nIn her eyes the whole of him, with all his habits, ideas, desires, with\\nall his spiritual and physical temperament, was one thing—love for\\nwomen, and that love, she felt, ought to be entirely concentrated on\\nher alone. That love was less; consequently, as she reasoned, he must\\nhave transferred part of his love to other women or to another\\nwoman—and she was jealous. She was jealous not of any particular woman\\nbut of the decrease of his love. Not having got an object for her\\njealousy, she was on the lookout for it. At the slightest hint she\\ntransferred her jealousy from one object to another. At one time she\\nwas jealous of those low women with whom he might so easily renew his\\nold bachelor ties; then she was jealous of the society women he might\\nmeet; then she was jealous of the imaginary girl whom he might want to\\nmarry, for whose sake he would break with her. And this last form of\\njealousy tortured her most of all, especially as he had unwarily told\\nher, in a moment of frankness, that his mother knew him so little that\\nshe had had the audacity to try and persuade him to marry the young\\nPrincess Sorokina.\\n\\nAnd being jealous of him, Anna was indignant against him and found\\ngrounds for indignation in everything. For everything that was\\ndifficult in her position she blamed him. The agonizing condition of\\nsuspense she had passed in Moscow, the tardiness and indecision of\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch, her solitude—she put it all down to him. If he\\nhad loved her he would have seen all the bitterness of her position,\\nand would have rescued her from it. For her being in Moscow and not in\\nthe country, he was to blame too. He could not live buried in the\\ncountry as she would have liked to do. He must have society, and he had\\nput her in this awful position, the bitterness of which he would not\\nsee. And again, it was his fault that she was forever separated from\\nher son.\\n\\nEven the rare moments of tenderness that came from time to time did not\\nsoothe her; in his tenderness now she saw a shade of complacency, of\\nself-confidence, which had not been of old, and which exasperated her.\\n\\nIt was dusk. Anna was alone, and waiting for him to come back from a\\nbachelor dinner. She walked up and down in his study (the room where\\nthe noise from the street was least heard), and thought over every\\ndetail of their yesterday’s quarrel. Going back from the\\nwell-remembered, offensive words of the quarrel to what had been the\\nground of it, she arrived at last at its origin. For a long while she\\ncould hardly believe that their dissension had arisen from a\\nconversation so inoffensive, of so little moment to either. But so it\\nactually had been. It all arose from his laughing at the girls’ high\\nschools, declaring they were useless, while she defended them. He had\\nspoken slightingly of women’s education in general, and had said that\\nHannah, Anna’s English protégée, had not the slightest need to know\\nanything of physics.\\n\\nThis irritated Anna. She saw in this a contemptuous reference to her\\noccupations. And she bethought her of a phrase to pay him back for the\\npain he had given her. “I don’t expect you to understand me, my\\nfeelings, as anyone who loved me might, but simple delicacy I did\\nexpect,” she said.\\n\\nAnd he had actually flushed with vexation, and had said something\\nunpleasant. She could not recall her answer, but at that point, with an\\nunmistakable desire to wound her too, he had said:\\n\\n“I feel no interest in your infatuation over this girl, that’s true,\\nbecause I see it’s unnatural.”\\n\\nThe cruelty with which he shattered the world she had built up for\\nherself so laboriously to enable her to endure her hard life, the\\ninjustice with which he had accused her of affectation, of\\nartificiality, aroused her.\\n\\n“I am very sorry that nothing but what’s coarse and material is\\ncomprehensible and natural to you,” she said and walked out of the\\nroom.\\n\\nWhen he had come in to her yesterday evening, they had not referred to\\nthe quarrel, but both felt that the quarrel had been smoothed over, but\\nwas not at an end.\\n\\nToday he had not been at home all day, and she felt so lonely and\\nwretched in being on bad terms with him that she wanted to forget it\\nall, to forgive him, and be reconciled with him; she wanted to throw\\nthe blame on herself and to justify him.\\n\\n“I am myself to blame. I’m irritable, I’m insanely jealous. I will make\\nit up with him, and we’ll go away to the country; there I shall be more\\nat peace.”\\n\\n“Unnatural!” She suddenly recalled the word that had stung her most of\\nall, not so much the word itself as the intent to wound her with which\\nit was said. “I know what he meant; he meant—unnatural, not loving my\\nown daughter, to love another person’s child. What does he know of love\\nfor children, of my love for Seryozha, whom I’ve sacrificed for him?\\nBut that wish to wound me! No, he loves another woman, it must be so.”\\n\\nAnd perceiving that, while trying to regain her peace of mind, she had\\ngone round the same circle that she had been round so often before, and\\nhad come back to her former state of exasperation, she was horrified at\\nherself. “Can it be impossible? Can it be beyond me to control myself?”\\nshe said to herself, and began again from the beginning. “He’s\\ntruthful, he’s honest, he loves me. I love him, and in a few days the\\ndivorce will come. What more do I want? I want peace of mind and trust,\\nand I will take the blame on myself. Yes, now when he comes in, I will\\ntell him I was wrong, though I was not wrong, and we will go away\\ntomorrow.”\\n\\nAnd to escape thinking any more, and being overcome by irritability,\\nshe rang, and ordered the boxes to be brought up for packing their\\nthings for the country.\\n\\nAt ten o’clock Vronsky came in 24\\n\\n“Well, was it nice?” she asked, coming out to meet him with a penitent\\nand meek expression.\\n\\n“Just as usual,” he answered, seeing at a glance that she was in one of\\nher good moods. He was used by now to these transitions, and he was\\nparticularly glad to see it today, as he was in a specially good humor\\nhimself.\\n\\n“What do I see? Come, that’s good!” he said, pointing to the boxes in\\nthe passage.\\n\\n“Yes, we must go. I went out for a drive, and it was so fine I longed\\nto be in the country. There’s nothing to keep you, is there?”\\n\\n“It’s the one thing I desire. I’ll be back directly, and we’ll talk it\\nover; I only want to change my coat. Order some tea.”\\n\\nAnd he went into his room.\\n\\nThere was something mortifying in the way he had said “Come, that’s\\ngood,” as one says to a child when it leaves off being naughty, and\\nstill more mortifying was the contrast between her penitent and his\\nself-confident tone; and for one instant she felt the lust of strife\\nrising up in her again, but making an effort she conquered it, and met\\nVronsky as good-humoredly as before.\\n\\nWhen he came in she told him, partly repeating phrases she had prepared\\nbeforehand, how she had spent the day, and her plans for going away.\\n\\n“You know it came to me almost like an inspiration,” she said. “Why\\nwait here for the divorce? Won’t it be just the same in the country? I\\ncan’t wait any longer! I don’t want to go on hoping, I don’t want to\\nhear anything about the divorce. I have made up my mind it shall not\\nhave any more influence on my life. Do you agree?”\\n\\n“Oh, yes!” he said, glancing uneasily at her excited face.\\n\\n“What did you do? Who was there?” she said, after a pause.\\n\\nVronsky mentioned the names of the guests. “The dinner was first rate,\\nand the boat race, and it was all pleasant enough, but in Moscow they\\ncan never do anything without something _ridicule_. A lady of a sort\\nappeared on the scene, teacher of swimming to the Queen of Sweden, and\\ngave us an exhibition of her skill.”\\n\\n“How? did she swim?” asked Anna, frowning.\\n\\n“In an absurd red _costume de natation;_ she was old and hideous too.\\nSo when shall we go?”\\n\\n“What an absurd fancy! Why, did she swim in some special way, then?”\\nsaid Anna, not answering.\\n\\n“There was absolutely nothing in it. That’s just what I say, it was\\nawfully stupid. Well, then, when do you think of going?”\\n\\nAnna shook her head as though trying to drive away some unpleasant\\nidea.\\n\\n“When? Why, the sooner the better! By tomorrow we shan’t be ready. The\\nday after tomorrow.”\\n\\n“Yes ... oh, no, wait a minute! The day after tomorrow’s Sunday, I have\\nto be at maman’s,” said Vronsky, embarrassed, because as soon as he\\nuttered his mother’s name he was aware of her intent, suspicious eyes.\\nHis embarrassment confirmed her suspicion. She flushed hotly and drew\\naway from him. It was now not the Queen of Sweden’s swimming-mistress\\nwho filled Anna’s imagination, but the young Princess Sorokina. She was\\nstaying in a village near Moscow with Countess Vronskaya.\\n\\n“Can’t you go tomorrow?” she said.\\n\\n“Well, no! The deeds and the money for the business I’m going there for\\nI can’t get by tomorrow,” he answered.\\n\\n“If so, we won’t go at all.”\\n\\n“But why so?”\\n\\n“I shall not go later. Monday or never!”\\n\\n“What for?” said Vronsky, as though in amazement. “Why, there’s no\\nmeaning in it!”\\n\\n“There’s no meaning in it to you, because you care nothing for me. You\\ndon’t care to understand my life. The one thing that I cared for here\\nwas Hannah. You say it’s affectation. Why, you said yesterday that I\\ndon’t love my daughter, that I love this English girl, that it’s\\nunnatural. I should like to know what life there is for me that could\\nbe natural!”\\n\\nFor an instant she had a clear vision of what she was doing, and was\\nhorrified at how she had fallen away from her resolution. But even\\nthough she knew it was her own ruin, she could not restrain herself,\\ncould not keep herself from proving to him that he was wrong, could not\\ngive way to him.\\n\\n“I never said that; I said I did not sympathize with this sudden\\npassion.”\\n\\n“How is it, though you boast of your straightforwardness, you don’t\\ntell the truth?”\\n\\n“I never boast, and I never tell lies,” he said slowly, restraining his\\nrising anger. “It’s a great pity if you can’t respect....”\\n\\n“Respect was invented to cover the empty place where love should be.\\nAnd if you don’t love me any more, it would be better and more honest\\nto say so.”\\n\\n“No, this is becoming unbearable!” cried Vronsky, getting up from his\\nchair; and stopping short, facing her, he said, speaking deliberately:\\n“What do you try my patience for?” looking as though he might have said\\nmuch more, but was restraining himself. “It has limits.”\\n\\n“What do you mean by that?” she cried, looking with terror at the\\nundisguised hatred in his whole face, and especially in his cruel,\\nmenacing eyes.\\n\\n“I mean to say....” he was beginning, but he checked himself. “I must\\nask what it is you want of me?”\\n\\n“What can I want? All I can want is that you should not desert me, as\\nyou think of doing,” she said, understanding all he had not uttered.\\n“But that I don’t want; that’s secondary. I want love, and there is\\nnone. So then all is over.”\\n\\nShe turned towards the door.\\n\\n“Stop! sto-op!” said Vronsky, with no change in the gloomy lines of his\\nbrows, though he held her by the hand. “What is it all about? I said\\nthat we must put off going for three days, and on that you told me I\\nwas lying, that I was not an honorable man.”\\n\\n“Yes, and I repeat that the man who reproaches me with having\\nsacrificed everything for me,” she said, recalling the words of a still\\nearlier quarrel, “that he’s worse than a dishonorable man—he’s a\\nheartless man.”\\n\\n“Oh, there are limits to endurance!” he cried, and hastily let go her\\nhand.\\n\\n“He hates me, that’s clear,” she thought, and in silence, without\\nlooking round, she walked with faltering steps out of the room. “He\\nloves another woman, that’s even clearer,” she said to herself as she\\nwent into her own room. “I want love, and there is none. So, then, all\\nis over.” She repeated the words she had said, “and it must be ended.”\\n\\n“But how?” she asked herself, and she sat down in a low chair before\\nthe looking-glass.\\n\\nThoughts of where she would go now, whether to the aunt who had brought\\nher up, to Dolly, or simply alone abroad, and of what _he_ was doing\\nnow alone in his study; whether this was the final quarrel, or whether\\nreconciliation were still possible; and of what all her old friends at\\nPetersburg would say of her now; and of how Alexey Alexandrovitch would\\nlook at it, and many other ideas of what would happen now after this\\nrupture, came into her head; but she did not give herself up to them\\nwith all her heart. At the bottom of her heart was some obscure idea\\nthat alone interested her, but she could not get clear sight of it.\\nThinking once more of Alexey Alexandrovitch, she recalled the time of\\nher illness after her confinement, and the feeling which never left her\\nat that time. “Why didn’t I die?” and the words and the feeling of that\\ntime came back to her. And all at once she knew what was in her soul.\\nYes, it was that idea which alone solved all. “Yes, to die!... And the\\nshame and disgrace of Alexey Alexandrovitch and of Seryozha, and my\\nawful shame, it will all be saved by death. To die! and he will feel\\nremorse; will be sorry; will love me; he will suffer on my account.”\\nWith the trace of a smile of commiseration for herself she sat down in\\nthe armchair, taking off and putting on the rings on her left hand,\\nvividly picturing from different sides his feelings after her death.\\n\\nApproaching footsteps—his steps—distracted her attention. As though\\nabsorbed in the arrangement of her rings, she did not even turn to him.\\n\\nHe went up to her, and taking her by the hand, said softly:\\n\\n“Anna, we’ll go the day after tomorrow, if you like. I agree to\\neverything.”\\n\\nShe did not speak.\\n\\n“What is it?” he urged.\\n\\n“You know,” she said, and at the same instant, unable to restrain\\nherself any longer, she burst into sobs.\\n\\n“Cast me off!” she articulated between her sobs. “I’ll go away tomorrow\\n... I’ll do more. What am I? An immoral woman! A stone round your neck.\\nI don’t want to make you wretched, I don’t want to! I’ll set you free.\\nYou don’t love me; you love someone else!”\\n\\nVronsky besought her to be calm, and declared that there was no trace\\nof foundation for her jealousy; that he had never ceased, and never\\nwould cease, to love her; that he loved her more than ever.\\n\\n“Anna, why distress yourself and me so?” he said to her, kissing her\\nhands. There was tenderness now in his face, and she fancied she caught\\nthe sound of tears in his voice, and she felt them wet on her hand. And\\ninstantly Anna’s despairing jealousy changed to a despairing passion of\\ntenderness. She put her arms round him, and covered with kisses his\\nhead, his neck, his hands 25\\n\\nFeeling that the reconciliation was complete, Anna set eagerly to work\\nin the morning preparing for their departure. Though it was not settled\\nwhether they should go on Monday or Tuesday, as they had each given way\\nto the other, Anna packed busily, feeling absolutely indifferent\\nwhether they went a day earlier or later. She was standing in her room\\nover an open box, taking things out of it, when he came in to see her\\nearlier than usual, dressed to go out.\\n\\n“I’m going off at once to see maman; she can send me the money by\\nYegorov. And I shall be ready to go tomorrow,” he said.\\n\\nThough she was in such a good mood, the thought of his visit to his\\nmother’s gave her a pang.\\n\\n“No, I shan’t be ready by then myself,” she said; and at once\\nreflected, “so then it was possible to arrange to do as I wished.” “No,\\ndo as you meant to do. Go into the dining-room, I’m coming directly.\\nIt’s only to turn out those things that aren’t wanted,” she said,\\nputting something more on the heap of frippery that lay in Annushka’s\\narms.\\n\\nVronsky was eating his beefsteak when she came into the dining-room.\\n\\n“You wouldn’t believe how distasteful these rooms have become to me,”\\nshe said, sitting down beside him to her coffee. “There’s nothing more\\nawful than these _chambres garnies_. There’s no individuality in them,\\nno soul. These clocks, and curtains, and, worst of all, the\\nwallpapers—they’re a nightmare. I think of Vozdvizhenskoe as the\\npromised land. You’re not sending the horses off yet?”\\n\\n“No, they will come after us. Where are you going to?”\\n\\n“I wanted to go to Wilson’s to take some dresses to her. So it’s really\\nto be tomorrow?” she said in a cheerful voice; but suddenly her face\\nchanged.\\n\\nVronsky’s valet came in to ask him to sign a receipt for a telegram\\nfrom Petersburg. There was nothing out of the way in Vronsky’s getting\\na telegram, but he said, as though anxious to conceal something from\\nher, that the receipt was in his study, and he turned hurriedly to her.\\n\\n“By tomorrow, without fail, I will finish it all.”\\n\\n“From whom is the telegram?” she asked, not hearing him.\\n\\n“From Stiva,” he answered reluctantly.\\n\\n“Why didn’t you show it to me? What secret can there be between Stiva\\nand me?”\\n\\nVronsky called the valet back, and told him to bring the telegram.\\n\\n“I didn’t want to show it to you, because Stiva has such a passion for\\ntelegraphing: why telegraph when nothing is settled?”\\n\\n“About the divorce?”\\n\\n“Yes; but he says he has not been able to come at anything yet. He has\\npromised a decisive answer in a day or two. But here it is; read it.”\\n\\nWith trembling hands Anna took the telegram, and read what Vronsky had\\ntold her. At the end was added: “Little hope; but I will do everything\\npossible and impossible.”\\n\\n“I said yesterday that it’s absolutely nothing to me when I get, or\\nwhether I never get, a divorce,” she said, flushing crimson. “There was\\nnot the slightest necessity to hide it from me.” “So he may hide and\\ndoes hide his correspondence with women from me,” she thought.\\n\\n“Yashvin meant to come this morning with Voytov,” said Vronsky; “I\\nbelieve he’s won from Pyevtsov all and more than he can pay, about\\nsixty thousand.”\\n\\n“No,” she said, irritated by his so obviously showing by this change of\\nsubject that he was irritated, “why did you suppose that this news\\nwould affect me so, that you must even try to hide it? I said I don’t\\nwant to consider it, and I should have liked you to care as little\\nabout it as I do.”\\n\\n“I care about it because I like definiteness,” he said.\\n\\n“Definiteness is not in the form but the love,” she said, more and more\\nirritated, not by his words, but by the tone of cool composure in which\\nhe spoke. “What do you want it for?”\\n\\n“My God! love again,” he thought, frowning.\\n\\n“Oh, you know what for; for your sake and your children’s in the\\nfuture.”\\n\\n“There won’t be children in the future.”\\n\\n“That’s a great pity,” he said.\\n\\n“You want it for the children’s sake, but you don’t think of me?” she\\nsaid, quite forgetting or not having heard that he had said, “_For your\\nsake_ and the children’s.”\\n\\nThe question of the possibility of having children had long been a\\nsubject of dispute and irritation to her. His desire to have children\\nshe interpreted as a proof he did not prize her beauty.\\n\\n“Oh, I said: for your sake. Above all for your sake,” he repeated,\\nfrowning as though in pain, “because I am certain that the greater part\\nof your irritability comes from the indefiniteness of the position.”\\n\\n“Yes, now he has laid aside all pretense, and all his cold hatred for\\nme is apparent,” she thought, not hearing his words, but watching with\\nterror the cold, cruel judge who looked mocking her out of his eyes.\\n\\n“The cause is not that,” she said, “and, indeed, I don’t see how the\\ncause of my irritability, as you call it, can be that I am completely\\nin your power. What indefiniteness is there in the position? on the\\ncontrary....”\\n\\n“I am very sorry that you don’t care to understand,” he interrupted,\\nobstinately anxious to give utterance to his thought. “The\\nindefiniteness consists in your imagining that I am free.”\\n\\n“On that score you can set your mind quite at rest,” she said, and\\nturning away from him, she began drinking her coffee.\\n\\nShe lifted her cup, with her little finger held apart, and put it to\\nher lips. After drinking a few sips she glanced at him, and by his\\nexpression, she saw clearly that he was repelled by her hand, and her\\ngesture, and the sound made by her lips.\\n\\n“I don’t care in the least what your mother thinks, and what match she\\nwants to make for you,” she said, putting the cup down with a shaking\\nhand.\\n\\n“But we are not talking about that.”\\n\\n“Yes, that’s just what we are talking about. And let me tell you that a\\nheartless woman, whether she’s old or not old, your mother or anyone\\nelse, is of no consequence to me, and I would not consent to know her.”\\n\\n“Anna, I beg you not to speak disrespectfully of my mother.”\\n\\n“A woman whose heart does not tell her where her son’s happiness and\\nhonor lie has no heart.”\\n\\n“I repeat my request that you will not speak disrespectfully of my\\nmother, whom I respect,” he said, raising his voice and looking sternly\\nat her.\\n\\nShe did not answer. Looking intently at him, at his face, his hands,\\nshe recalled all the details of their reconciliation the previous day,\\nand his passionate caresses. “There, just such caresses he has\\nlavished, and will lavish, and longs to lavish on other women!” she\\nthought.\\n\\n“You don’t love your mother. That’s all talk, and talk, and talk!” she\\nsaid, looking at him with hatred in her eyes.\\n\\n“Even if so, you must....”\\n\\n“Must decide, and I have decided,” she said, and she would have gone\\naway, but at that moment Yashvin walked into the room. Anna greeted him\\nand remained.\\n\\nWhy, when there was a tempest in her soul, and she felt she was\\nstanding at a turning point in her life, which might have fearful\\nconsequences—why, at that minute, she had to keep up appearances before\\nan outsider, who sooner or later must know it all—she did not know. But\\nat once quelling the storm within her, she sat down and began talking\\nto their guest.\\n\\n“Well, how are you getting on? Has your debt been paid you?” she asked\\nYashvin.\\n\\n“Oh, pretty fair; I fancy I shan’t get it all, but I shall get a good\\nhalf. And when are you off?” said Yashvin, looking at Vronsky, and\\nunmistakably guessing at a quarrel.\\n\\n“The day after tomorrow, I think,” said Vronsky.\\n\\n“You’ve been meaning to go so long, though.”\\n\\n“But now it’s quite decided,” said Anna, looking Vronsky straight in\\nthe face with a look which told him not to dream of the possibility of\\nreconciliation.\\n\\n“Don’t you feel sorry for that unlucky Pyevtsov?” she went on, talking\\nto Yashvin.\\n\\n“I’ve never asked myself the question, Anna Arkadyevna, whether I’m\\nsorry for him or not. You see, all my fortune’s here”—he touched his\\nbreast pocket—“and just now I’m a wealthy man. But today I’m going to\\nthe club, and I may come out a beggar. You see, whoever sits down to\\nplay with me—he wants to leave me without a shirt to my back, and so do\\nI him. And so we fight it out, and that’s the pleasure of it.”\\n\\n“Well, but suppose you were married,” said Anna, “how would it be for\\nyour wife?”\\n\\nYashvin laughed.\\n\\n“That’s why I’m not married, and never mean to be.”\\n\\n“And Helsingfors?” said Vronsky, entering into the conversation and\\nglancing at Anna’s smiling face. Meeting his eyes, Anna’s face\\ninstantly took a coldly severe expression as though she were saying to\\nhim: “It’s not forgotten. It’s all the same.”\\n\\n“Were you really in love?” she said to Yashvin.\\n\\n“Oh heavens! ever so many times! But you see, some men can play but\\nonly so that they can always lay down their cards when the hour of a\\n_rendezvous_ comes, while I can take up love, but only so as not to be\\nlate for my cards in the evening. That’s how I manage things.”\\n\\n“No, I didn’t mean that, but the real thing.” She would have said\\n_Helsingfors_, but would not repeat the word used by Vronsky.\\n\\nVoytov, who was buying the horse, came in. Anna got up and went out of\\nthe room.\\n\\nBefore leaving the house, Vronsky went into her room. She would have\\npretended to be looking for something on the table, but ashamed of\\nmaking a pretense, she looked straight in his face with cold eyes.\\n\\n“What do you want?” she asked in French.\\n\\n“To get the guarantee for Gambetta, I’ve sold him,” he said, in a tone\\nwhich said more clearly than words, “I’ve no time for discussing\\nthings, and it would lead to nothing.”\\n\\n“I’m not to blame in any way,” he thought. “If she will punish herself,\\n_tant pis pour elle._ But as he was going he fancied that she said\\nsomething, and his heart suddenly ached with pity for her.\\n\\n“Eh, Anna?” he queried.\\n\\n“I said nothing,” she answered just as coldly and calmly.\\n\\n“Oh, nothing, _tant pis_ then,” he thought, feeling cold again, and he\\nturned and went out. As he was going out he caught a glimpse in the\\nlooking-glass of her face, white, with quivering lips. He even wanted\\nto stop and to say some comforting word to her, but his legs carried\\nhim out of the room before he could think what to say. The whole of\\nthat day he spent away from home, and when he came in late in the\\nevening the maid told him that Anna Arkadyevna had a headache and\\nbegged him not to go in to her 26\\n\\nNever before had a day been passed in quarrel. Today was the first\\ntime. And this was not a quarrel. It was the open acknowledgment of\\ncomplete coldness. Was it possible to glance at her as he had glanced\\nwhen he came into the room for the guarantee?—to look at her, see her\\nheart was breaking with despair, and go out without a word with that\\nface of callous composure? He was not merely cold to her, he hated her\\nbecause he loved another woman—that was clear.\\n\\nAnd remembering all the cruel words he had said, Anna supplied, too,\\nthe words that he had unmistakably wished to say and could have said to\\nher, and she grew more and more exasperated.\\n\\n“I won’t prevent you,” he might say. “You can go where you like. You\\nwere unwilling to be divorced from your husband, no doubt so that you\\nmight go back to him. Go back to him. If you want money, I’ll give it\\nto you. How many roubles do you want?”\\n\\nAll the most cruel words that a brutal man could say, he said to her in\\nher imagination, and she could not forgive him for them, as though he\\nhad actually said them.\\n\\n“But didn’t he only yesterday swear he loved me, he, a truthful and\\nsincere man? Haven’t I despaired for nothing many times already?” she\\nsaid to herself afterwards.\\n\\nAll that day, except for the visit to Wilson’s, which occupied two\\nhours, Anna spent in doubts whether everything were over or whether\\nthere were still hope of reconciliation, whether she should go away at\\nonce or see him once more. She was expecting him the whole day, and in\\nthe evening, as she went to her own room, leaving a message for him\\nthat her head ached, she said to herself, “If he comes in spite of what\\nthe maid says, it means that he loves me still. If not, it means that\\nall is over, and then I will decide what I’m to do!...”\\n\\nIn the evening she heard the rumbling of his carriage stop at the\\nentrance, his ring, his steps and his conversation with the servant; he\\nbelieved what was told him, did not care to find out more, and went to\\nhis own room. So then everything was over.\\n\\nAnd death rose clearly and vividly before her mind as the sole means of\\nbringing back love for her in his heart, of punishing him and of\\ngaining the victory in that strife which the evil spirit in possession\\nof her heart was waging with him.\\n\\nNow nothing mattered: going or not going to Vozdvizhenskoe, getting or\\nnot getting a divorce from her husband—all that did not matter. The one\\nthing that mattered was punishing him. When she poured herself out her\\nusual dose of opium, and thought that she had only to drink off the\\nwhole bottle to die, it seemed to her so simple and easy, that she\\nbegan musing with enjoyment on how he would suffer, and repent and love\\nher memory when it would be too late. She lay in bed with open eyes, by\\nthe light of a single burned-down candle, gazing at the carved cornice\\nof the ceiling and at the shadow of the screen that covered part of it,\\nwhile she vividly pictured to herself how he would feel when she would\\nbe no more, when she would be only a memory to him. “How could I say\\nsuch cruel things to her?” he would say. “How could I go out of the\\nroom without saying anything to her? But now she is no more. She has\\ngone away from us forever. She is....” Suddenly the shadow of the\\nscreen wavered, pounced on the whole cornice, the whole ceiling; other\\nshadows from the other side swooped to meet it, for an instant the\\nshadows flitted back, but then with fresh swiftness they darted\\nforward, wavered, commingled, and all was darkness. “Death!” she\\nthought. And such horror came upon her that for a long while she could\\nnot realize where she was, and for a long while her trembling hands\\ncould not find the matches and light another candle, instead of the one\\nthat had burned down and gone out. “No, anything—only to live! Why, I\\nlove him! Why, he loves me! This has been before and will pass,” she\\nsaid, feeling that tears of joy at the return to life were trickling\\ndown her cheeks. And to escape from her panic she went hurriedly to his\\nroom.\\n\\nHe was asleep there, and sleeping soundly. She went up to him, and\\nholding the light above his face, she gazed a long while at him. Now\\nwhen he was asleep, she loved him so that at the sight of him she could\\nnot keep back tears of tenderness. But she knew that if he waked up he\\nwould look at her with cold eyes, convinced that he was right, and that\\nbefore telling him of her love, she would have to prove to him that he\\nhad been wrong in his treatment of her. Without waking him, she went\\nback, and after a second dose of opium she fell towards morning into a\\nheavy, incomplete sleep, during which she never quite lost\\nconsciousness.\\n\\nIn the morning she was waked by a horrible nightmare, which had\\nrecurred several times in her dreams, even before her connection with\\nVronsky. A little old man with unkempt beard was doing something bent\\ndown over some iron, muttering meaningless French words, and she, as\\nshe always did in this nightmare (it was what made the horror of it),\\nfelt that this peasant was taking no notice of her, but was doing\\nsomething horrible with the iron—over her. And she waked up in a cold\\nsweat.\\n\\nWhen she got up, the previous day came back to her as though veiled in\\nmist.\\n\\n“There was a quarrel. Just what has happened several times. I said I\\nhad a headache, and he did not come in to see me. Tomorrow we’re going\\naway; I must see him and get ready for the journey,” she said to\\nherself. And learning that he was in his study, she went down to him.\\nAs she passed through the drawing-room she heard a carriage stop at the\\nentrance, and looking out of the window she saw the carriage, from\\nwhich a young girl in a lilac hat was leaning out giving some direction\\nto the footman ringing the bell. After a parley in the hall, someone\\ncame upstairs, and Vronsky’s steps could be heard passing the\\ndrawing-room. He went rapidly downstairs. Anna went again to the\\nwindow. She saw him come out onto the steps without his hat and go up\\nto the carriage. The young girl in the lilac hat handed him a parcel.\\nVronsky, smiling, said something to her. The carriage drove away, he\\nran rapidly upstairs again.\\n\\nThe mists that had shrouded everything in her soul parted suddenly. The\\nfeelings of yesterday pierced the sick heart with a fresh pang. She\\ncould not understand now how she could have lowered herself by spending\\na whole day with him in his house. She went into his room to announce\\nher determination.\\n\\n“That was Madame Sorokina and her daughter. They came and brought me\\nthe money and the deeds from maman. I couldn’t get them yesterday. How\\nis your head, better?” he said quietly, not wishing to see and to\\nunderstand the gloomy and solemn expression of her face.\\n\\nShe looked silently, intently at him, standing in the middle of the\\nroom. He glanced at her, frowned for a moment, and went on reading a\\nletter. She turned, and went deliberately out of the room. He still\\nmight have turned her back, but she had reached the door, he was still\\nsilent, and the only sound audible was the rustling of the note paper\\nas he turned it.\\n\\n“Oh, by the way,” he said at the very moment she was in the doorway,\\n“we’re going tomorrow for certain, aren’t we?”\\n\\n“You, but not I,” she said, turning round to him.\\n\\n“Anna, we can’t go on like this....”\\n\\n“You, but not I,” she repeated.\\n\\n“This is getting unbearable!”\\n\\n“You ... you will be sorry for this,” she said, and went out.\\n\\nFrightened by the desperate expression with which these words were\\nuttered, he jumped up and would have run after her, but on second\\nthoughts he sat down and scowled, setting his teeth. This vulgar—as he\\nthought it—threat of something vague exasperated him. “I’ve tried\\neverything,” he thought; “the only thing left is not to pay attention,”\\nand he began to get ready to drive into town, and again to his mother’s\\nto get her signature to the deeds.\\n\\nShe heard the sound of his steps about the study and the dining-room.\\nAt the drawing-room he stood still. But he did not turn in to see her,\\nhe merely gave an order that the horse should be given to Voytov if he\\ncame while he was away. Then she heard the carriage brought round, the\\ndoor opened, and he came out again. But he went back into the porch\\nagain, and someone was running upstairs. It was the valet running up\\nfor his gloves that had been forgotten. She went to the window and saw\\nhim take the gloves without looking, and touching the coachman on the\\nback he said something to him. Then without looking up at the window he\\nsettled himself in his usual attitude in the carriage, with his legs\\ncrossed, and drawing on his gloves he vanished round the corner 27\\n\\n“He has gone! It is over!” Anna said to herself, standing at the\\nwindow; and in answer to this statement the impression of the darkness\\nwhen the candle had flickered out, and of her fearful dream mingling\\ninto one, filled her heart with cold terror.\\n\\n“No, that cannot be!” she cried, and crossing the room she rang the\\nbell. She was so afraid now of being alone, that without waiting for\\nthe servant to come in, she went out to meet him.\\n\\n“Inquire where the count has gone,” she said. The servant answered that\\nthe count had gone to the stable.\\n\\n“His honor left word that if you cared to drive out, the carriage would\\nbe back immediately.”\\n\\n“Very good. Wait a minute. I’ll write a note at once. Send Mihail with\\nthe note to the stables. Make haste.”\\n\\nShe sat down and wrote:\\n\\n“I was wrong. Come back home; I must explain. For God’s sake come! I’m\\nafraid.”\\n\\nShe sealed it up and gave it to the servant.\\n\\nShe was afraid of being left alone now; she followed the servant out of\\nthe room, and went to the nursery.\\n\\n“Why, this isn’t it, this isn’t he! Where are his blue eyes, his sweet,\\nshy smile?” was her first thought when she saw her chubby, rosy little\\ngirl with her black, curly hair instead of Seryozha, whom in the tangle\\nof her ideas she had expected to see in the nursery. The little girl\\nsitting at the table was obstinately and violently battering on it with\\na cork, and staring aimlessly at her mother with her pitch-black eyes.\\nAnswering the English nurse that she was quite well, and that she was\\ngoing to the country tomorrow, Anna sat down by the little girl and\\nbegan spinning the cork to show her. But the child’s loud, ringing\\nlaugh, and the motion of her eyebrows, recalled Vronsky so vividly that\\nshe got up hurriedly, restraining her sobs, and went away. “Can it be\\nall over? No, it cannot be!” she thought. “He will come back. But how\\ncan he explain that smile, that excitement after he had been talking to\\nher? But even if he doesn’t explain, I will believe. If I don’t\\nbelieve, there’s only one thing left for me, and I can’t.”\\n\\nShe looked at her watch. Twenty minutes had passed. “By now he has\\nreceived the note and is coming back. Not long, ten minutes more....\\nBut what if he doesn’t come? No, that cannot be. He mustn’t see me with\\ntear-stained eyes. I’ll go and wash. Yes, yes; did I do my hair or\\nnot?” she asked herself. And she could not remember. She felt her head\\nwith her hand. “Yes, my hair has been done, but when I did it I can’t\\nin the least remember.” She could not believe the evidence of her hand,\\nand went up to the pier-glass to see whether she really had done her\\nhair. She certainly had, but she could not think when she had done it.\\n“Who’s that?” she thought, looking in the looking-glass at the swollen\\nface with strangely glittering eyes, that looked in a scared way at\\nher. “Why, it’s I!” she suddenly understood, and looking round, she\\nseemed all at once to feel his kisses on her, and twitched her\\nshoulders, shuddering. Then she lifted her hand to her lips and kissed\\nit.\\n\\n“What is it? Why, I’m going out of my mind!” and she went into her\\nbedroom, where Annushka was tidying the room.\\n\\n“Annushka,” she said, coming to a standstill before her, and she stared\\nat the maid, not knowing what to say to her.\\n\\n“You meant to go and see Darya Alexandrovna,” said the girl, as though\\nshe understood.\\n\\n“Darya Alexandrovna? Yes, I’ll go.”\\n\\n“Fifteen minutes there, fifteen minutes back. He’s coming, he’ll be\\nhere soon.” She took out her watch and looked at it. “But how could he\\ngo away, leaving me in such a state? How can he live, without making it\\nup with me?” She went to the window and began looking into the street.\\nJudging by the time, he might be back now. But her calculations might\\nbe wrong, and she began once more to recall when he had started and to\\ncount the minutes.\\n\\nAt the moment when she had moved away to the big clock to compare it\\nwith her watch, someone drove up. Glancing out of the window, she saw\\nhis carriage. But no one came upstairs, and voices could be heard\\nbelow. It was the messenger who had come back in the carriage. She went\\ndown to him.\\n\\n“We didn’t catch the count. The count had driven off on the lower city\\nroad.”\\n\\n“What do you say? What!...” she said to the rosy, good-humored Mihail,\\nas he handed her back her note.\\n\\n“Why, then, he has never received it!” she thought.\\n\\n“Go with this note to Countess Vronskaya’s place, you know? and bring\\nan answer back immediately,” she said to the messenger.\\n\\n“And I, what am I going to do?” she thought. “Yes, I’m going to\\nDolly’s, that’s true or else I shall go out of my mind. Yes, and I can\\ntelegraph, too.” And she wrote a telegram. “I absolutely must talk to\\nyou; come at once.” After sending off the telegram, she went to dress.\\nWhen she was dressed and in her hat, she glanced again into the eyes of\\nthe plump, comfortable-looking Annushka. There was unmistakable\\nsympathy in those good-natured little gray eyes.\\n\\n“Annushka, dear, what am I to do?” said Anna, sobbing and sinking\\nhelplessly into a chair.\\n\\n“Why fret yourself so, Anna Arkadyevna? Why, there’s nothing out of the\\nway. You drive out a little, and it’ll cheer you up,” said the maid.\\n\\n“Yes, I’m going,” said Anna, rousing herself and getting up. “And if\\nthere’s a telegram while I’m away, send it on to Darya Alexandrovna’s\\n... but no, I shall be back myself.”\\n\\n“Yes, I mustn’t think, I must do something, drive somewhere, and most\\nof all, get out of this house,” she said, feeling with terror the\\nstrange turmoil going on in her own heart, and she made haste to go out\\nand get into the carriage.\\n\\n“Where to?” asked Pyotr before getting onto the box.\\n\\n“To Znamenka, the Oblonskys 28\\n\\nIt was bright and sunny. A fine rain had been falling all the morning,\\nand now it had not long cleared up. The iron roofs, the flags of the\\nroads, the flints of the pavements, the wheels and leather, the brass\\nand the tinplate of the carriages—all glistened brightly in the May\\nsunshine. It was three o’clock, and the very liveliest time in the\\nstreets.\\n\\nAs she sat in a corner of the comfortable carriage, that hardly swayed\\non its supple springs, while the grays trotted swiftly, in the midst of\\nthe unceasing rattle of wheels and the changing impressions in the pure\\nair, Anna ran over the events of the last days, and she saw her\\nposition quite differently from how it had seemed at home. Now the\\nthought of death seemed no longer so terrible and so clear to her, and\\ndeath itself no longer seemed so inevitable. Now she blamed herself for\\nthe humiliation to which she had lowered herself. “I entreat him to\\nforgive me. I have given in to him. I have owned myself in fault. What\\nfor? Can’t I live without him?” And leaving unanswered the question how\\nshe was going to live without him, she fell to reading the signs on the\\nshops. “Office and warehouse. Dental surgeon. Yes, I’ll tell Dolly all\\nabout it. She doesn’t like Vronsky. I shall be sick and ashamed, but\\nI’ll tell her. She loves me, and I’ll follow her advice. I won’t give\\nin to him; I won’t let him train me as he pleases. Filippov, bun shop.\\nThey say they send their dough to Petersburg. The Moscow water is so\\ngood for it. Ah, the springs at Mitishtchen, and the pancakes!”\\n\\nAnd she remembered how, long, long ago, when she was a girl of\\nseventeen, she had gone with her aunt to Troitsa. “Riding, too. Was\\nthat really me, with red hands? How much that seemed to me then\\nsplendid and out of reach has become worthless, while what I had then\\nhas gone out of my reach forever! Could I ever have believed then that\\nI could come to such humiliation? How conceited and self-satisfied he\\nwill be when he gets my note! But I will show him.... How horrid that\\npaint smells! Why is it they’re always painting and building? _Modes et\\nrobes_, she read. A man bowed to her. It was Annushka’s husband. “Our\\nparasites”; she remembered how Vronsky had said that. “Our? Why our?\\nWhat’s so awful is that one can’t tear up the past by its roots. One\\ncan’t tear it out, but one can hide one’s memory of it. And I’ll hide\\nit.” And then she thought of her past with Alexey Alexandrovitch, of\\nhow she had blotted the memory of it out of her life. “Dolly will think\\nI’m leaving my second husband, and so I certainly must be in the wrong.\\nAs if I cared to be right! I can’t help it!” she said, and she wanted\\nto cry. But at once she fell to wondering what those two girls could be\\nsmiling about. “Love, most likely. They don’t know how dreary it is,\\nhow low.... The boulevard and the children. Three boys running, playing\\nat horses. Seryozha! And I’m losing everything and not getting him\\nback. Yes, I’m losing everything, if he doesn’t return. Perhaps he was\\nlate for the train and has come back by now. Longing for humiliation\\nagain!” she said to herself. “No, I’ll go to Dolly, and say straight\\nout to her, I’m unhappy, I deserve this, I’m to blame, but still I’m\\nunhappy, help me. These horses, this carriage—how loathsome I am to\\nmyself in this carriage—all his; but I won’t see them again.”\\n\\nThinking over the words in which she would tell Dolly, and mentally\\nworking her heart up to great bitterness, Anna went upstairs.\\n\\n“Is there anyone with her?” she asked in the hall.\\n\\n“Katerina Alexandrovna Levin,” answered the footman.\\n\\n“Kitty! Kitty, whom Vronsky was in love with!” thought Anna, “the girl\\nhe thinks of with love. He’s sorry he didn’t marry her. But me he\\nthinks of with hatred, and is sorry he had anything to do with me.”\\n\\nThe sisters were having a consultation about nursing when Anna called.\\nDolly went down alone to see the visitor who had interrupted their\\nconversation.\\n\\n“Well, so you’ve not gone away yet? I meant to have come to you,” she\\nsaid; “I had a letter from Stiva today.”\\n\\n“We had a telegram too,” answered Anna, looking round for Kitty.\\n\\n“He writes that he can’t make out quite what Alexey Alexandrovitch\\nwants, but he won’t go away without a decisive answer.”\\n\\n“I thought you had someone with you. Can I see the letter?”\\n\\n“Yes; Kitty,” said Dolly, embarrassed. “She stayed in the nursery. She\\nhas been very ill.”\\n\\n“So I heard. May I see the letter?”\\n\\n“I’ll get it directly. But he doesn’t refuse; on the contrary, Stiva\\nhas hopes,” said Dolly, stopping in the doorway.\\n\\n“I haven’t, and indeed I don’t wish it,” said Anna.\\n\\n“What’s this? Does Kitty consider it degrading to meet me?” thought\\nAnna when she was alone. “Perhaps she’s right, too. But it’s not for\\nher, the girl who was in love with Vronsky, it’s not for her to show me\\nthat, even if it is true. I know that in my position I can’t be\\nreceived by any decent woman. I knew that from the first moment I\\nsacrificed everything to him. And this is my reward! Oh, how I hate\\nhim! And what did I come here for? I’m worse here, more miserable.” She\\nheard from the next room the sisters’ voices in consultation. “And what\\nam I going to say to Dolly now? Amuse Kitty by the sight of my\\nwretchedness, submit to her patronizing? No; and besides, Dolly\\nwouldn’t understand. And it would be no good my telling her. It would\\nonly be interesting to see Kitty, to show her how I despise everyone\\nand everything, how nothing matters to me now.”\\n\\nDolly came in with the letter. Anna read it and handed it back in\\nsilence.\\n\\n“I knew all that,” she said, “and it doesn’t interest me in the least.”\\n\\n“Oh, why so? On the contrary, I have hopes,” said Dolly, looking\\ninquisitively at Anna. She had never seen her in such a strangely\\nirritable condition. “When are you going away?” she asked.\\n\\nAnna, half-closing her eyes, looked straight before her and did not\\nanswer.\\n\\n“Why does Kitty shrink from me?” she said, looking at the door and\\nflushing red.\\n\\n“Oh, what nonsense! She’s nursing, and things aren’t going right with\\nher, and I’ve been advising her.... She’s delighted. She’ll be here in\\na minute,” said Dolly awkwardly, not clever at lying. “Yes, here she\\nis.”\\n\\nHearing that Anna had called, Kitty had wanted not to appear, but Dolly\\npersuaded her. Rallying her forces, Kitty went in, walked up to her,\\nblushing, and shook hands.\\n\\n“I am so glad to see you,” she said with a trembling voice.\\n\\nKitty had been thrown into confusion by the inward conflict between her\\nantagonism to this bad woman and her desire to be nice to her. But as\\nsoon as she saw Anna’s lovely and attractive face, all feeling of\\nantagonism disappeared.\\n\\n“I should not have been surprised if you had not cared to meet me. I’m\\nused to everything. You have been ill? Yes, you are changed,” said\\nAnna.\\n\\nKitty felt that Anna was looking at her with hostile eyes. She ascribed\\nthis hostility to the awkward position in which Anna, who had once\\npatronized her, must feel with her now, and she felt sorry for her.\\n\\nThey talked of Kitty’s illness, of the baby, of Stiva, but it was\\nobvious that nothing interested Anna.\\n\\n“I came to say good-bye to you,” she said, getting up.\\n\\n“Oh, when are you going?”\\n\\nBut again not answering, Anna turned to Kitty.\\n\\n“Yes, I am very glad to have seen you,” she said with a smile. “I have\\nheard so much of you from everyone, even from your husband. He came to\\nsee me, and I liked him exceedingly,” she said, unmistakably with\\nmalicious intent. “Where is he?”\\n\\n“He has gone back to the country,” said Kitty, blushing.\\n\\n“Remember me to him, be sure you do.”\\n\\n“I’ll be sure to!” Kitty said naïvely, looking compassionately into her\\neyes.\\n\\n“So good-bye, Dolly.” And kissing Dolly and shaking hands with Kitty,\\nAnna went out hurriedly.\\n\\n“She’s just the same and just as charming! She’s very lovely!” said\\nKitty, when she was alone with her sister. “But there’s something\\npiteous about her. Awfully piteous!”\\n\\n“Yes, there’s something unusual about her today,” said Dolly. “When I\\nwent with her into the hall, I fancied she was almost crying 29\\n\\nAnna got into the carriage again in an even worse frame of mind than\\nwhen she set out from home. To her previous tortures was added now that\\nsense of mortification and of being an outcast which she had felt so\\ndistinctly on meeting Kitty.\\n\\n“Where to? Home?” asked Pyotr.\\n\\n“Yes, home,” she said, not even thinking now where she was going.\\n\\n“How they looked at me as something dreadful, incomprehensible, and\\ncurious! What can he be telling the other with such warmth?” she\\nthought, staring at two men who walked by. “Can one ever tell anyone\\nwhat one is feeling? I meant to tell Dolly, and it’s a good thing I\\ndidn’t tell her. How pleased she would have been at my misery! She\\nwould have concealed it, but her chief feeling would have been delight\\nat my being punished for the happiness she envied me for. Kitty, she\\nwould have been even more pleased. How I can see through her! She knows\\nI was more than usually sweet to her husband. And she’s jealous and\\nhates me. And she despises me. In her eyes I’m an immoral woman. If I\\nwere an immoral woman I could have made her husband fall in love with\\nme ... if I’d cared to. And, indeed, I did care to. There’s someone\\nwho’s pleased with himself,” she thought, as she saw a fat, rubicund\\ngentleman coming towards her. He took her for an acquaintance, and\\nlifted his glossy hat above his bald, glossy head, and then perceived\\nhis mistake. “He thought he knew me. Well, he knows me as well as\\nanyone in the world knows me. I don’t know myself. I know my appetites,\\nas the French say. They want that dirty ice cream, that they do know\\nfor certain,” she thought, looking at two boys stopping an ice cream\\nseller, who took a barrel off his head and began wiping his perspiring\\nface with a towel. “We all want what is sweet and nice. If not\\nsweetmeats, then a dirty ice. And Kitty’s the same—if not Vronsky, then\\nLevin. And she envies me, and hates me. And we all hate each other. I\\nKitty, Kitty me. Yes, that’s the truth. ‘_Tiutkin, coiffeur._’ _Je me\\nfais coiffer par Tiutkin...._ I’ll tell him that when he comes,” she\\nthought and smiled. But the same instant she remembered that she had no\\none now to tell anything amusing to. “And there’s nothing amusing,\\nnothing mirthful, really. It’s all hateful. They’re singing for\\nvespers, and how carefully that merchant crosses himself! as if he were\\nafraid of missing something. Why these churches and this singing and\\nthis humbug? Simply to conceal that we all hate each other like these\\ncab drivers who are abusing each other so angrily. Yashvin says, ‘He\\nwants to strip me of my shirt, and I him of his.’ Yes, that’s the\\ntruth!”\\n\\nShe was plunged in these thoughts, which so engrossed her that she left\\noff thinking of her own position, when the carriage drew up at the\\nsteps of her house. It was only when she saw the porter running out to\\nmeet her that she remembered she had sent the note and the telegram.\\n\\n“Is there an answer?” she inquired.\\n\\n“I’ll see this minute,” answered the porter, and glancing into his\\nroom, he took out and gave her the thin square envelope of a telegram.\\n“I can’t come before ten o’clock.—Vronsky,” she read.\\n\\n“And hasn’t the messenger come back?”\\n\\n“No,” answered the porter.\\n\\n“Then, since it’s so, I know what I must do,” she said, and feeling a\\nvague fury and craving for revenge rising up within her, she ran\\nupstairs. “I’ll go to him myself. Before going away forever, I’ll tell\\nhim all. Never have I hated anyone as I hate that man!” she thought.\\nSeeing his hat on the rack, she shuddered with aversion. She did not\\nconsider that his telegram was an answer to her telegram and that he\\nhad not yet received her note. She pictured him to herself as talking\\ncalmly to his mother and Princess Sorokina and rejoicing at her\\nsufferings. “Yes, I must go quickly,” she said, not knowing yet where\\nshe was going. She longed to get away as quickly as possible from the\\nfeelings she had gone through in that awful house. The servants, the\\nwalls, the things in that house—all aroused repulsion and hatred in her\\nand lay like a weight upon her.\\n\\n“Yes, I must go to the railway station, and if he’s not there, then go\\nthere and catch him.” Anna looked at the railway timetable in the\\nnewspapers. An evening train went at two minutes past eight. “Yes, I\\nshall be in time.” She gave orders for the other horses to be put in\\nthe carriage, and packed in a traveling-bag the things needed for a few\\ndays. She knew she would never come back here again.\\n\\nAmong the plans that came into her head she vaguely determined that\\nafter what would happen at the station or at the countess’s house, she\\nwould go as far as the first town on the Nizhni road and stop there.\\n\\nDinner was on the table; she went up, but the smell of the bread and\\ncheese was enough to make her feel that all food was disgusting. She\\nordered the carriage and went out. The house threw a shadow now right\\nacross the street, but it was a bright evening and still warm in the\\nsunshine. Annushka, who came down with her things, and Pyotr, who put\\nthe things in the carriage, and the coachman, evidently out of humor,\\nwere all hateful to her, and irritated her by their words and actions.\\n\\n“I don’t want you, Pyotr.”\\n\\n“But how about the ticket?”\\n\\n“Well, as you like, it doesn’t matter,” she said crossly.\\n\\nPyotr jumped on the box, and putting his arms akimbo, told the coachman\\nto drive to the booking-office 30\\n\\n“Here it is again! Again I understand it all!” Anna said to herself, as\\nsoon as the carriage had started and swaying lightly, rumbled over the\\ntiny cobbles of the paved road, and again one impression followed\\nrapidly upon another.\\n\\n“Yes; what was the last thing I thought of so clearly?” she tried to\\nrecall it. “‘_Tiutkin, coiffeur?_’—no, not that. Yes, of what Yashvin\\nsays, the struggle for existence and hatred is the one thing that holds\\nmen together. No, it’s a useless journey you’re making,” she said,\\nmentally addressing a party in a coach and four, evidently going for an\\nexcursion into the country. “And the dog you’re taking with you will be\\nno help to you. You can’t get away from yourselves.” Turning her eyes\\nin the direction Pyotr had turned to look, she saw a factory-hand\\nalmost dead-drunk, with hanging head, being led away by a policeman.\\n“Come, he’s found a quicker way,” she thought. “Count Vronsky and I did\\nnot find that happiness either, though we expected so much from it.”\\nAnd now for the first time Anna turned that glaring light in which she\\nwas seeing everything on to her relations with him, which she had\\nhitherto avoided thinking about. “What was it he sought in me? Not love\\nso much as the satisfaction of vanity.” She remembered his words, the\\nexpression of his face, that recalled an abject setter-dog, in the\\nearly days of their connection. And everything now confirmed this.\\n“Yes, there was the triumph of success in him. Of course there was love\\ntoo, but the chief element was the pride of success. He boasted of me.\\nNow that’s over. There’s nothing to be proud of. Not to be proud of,\\nbut to be ashamed of. He has taken from me all he could, and now I am\\nno use to him. He is weary of me and is trying not to be dishonorable\\nin his behavior to me. He let that out yesterday—he wants divorce and\\nmarriage so as to burn his ships. He loves me, but how? The zest is\\ngone, as the English say. That fellow wants everyone to admire him and\\nis very much pleased with himself,” she thought, looking at a red-faced\\nclerk, riding on a riding-school horse. “Yes, there’s not the same\\nflavor about me for him now. If I go away from him, at the bottom of\\nhis heart he will be glad.”\\n\\nThis was not mere supposition, she saw it distinctly in the piercing\\nlight, which revealed to her now the meaning of life and human\\nrelations.\\n\\n“My love keeps growing more passionate and egoistic, while his is\\nwaning and waning, and that’s why we’re drifting apart.” She went on\\nmusing. “And there’s no help for it. He is everything for me, and I\\nwant him more and more to give himself up to me entirely. And he wants\\nmore and more to get away from me. We walked to meet each other up to\\nthe time of our love, and then we have been irresistibly drifting in\\ndifferent directions. And there’s no altering that. He tells me I’m\\ninsanely jealous, and I have told myself that I am insanely jealous;\\nbut it’s not true. I’m not jealous, but I’m unsatisfied. But....” she\\nopened her lips, and shifted her place in the carriage in the\\nexcitement, aroused by the thought that suddenly struck her. “If I\\ncould be anything but a mistress, passionately caring for nothing but\\nhis caresses; but I can’t and I don’t care to be anything else. And by\\nthat desire I rouse aversion in him, and he rouses fury in me, and it\\ncannot be different. Don’t I know that he wouldn’t deceive me, that he\\nhas no schemes about Princess Sorokina, that he’s not in love with\\nKitty, that he won’t desert me! I know all that, but it makes it no\\nbetter for me. If without loving me, from _duty_ he’ll be good and kind\\nto me, without what I want, that’s a thousand times worse than\\nunkindness! That’s—hell! And that’s just how it is. For a long while\\nnow he hasn’t loved me. And where love ends, hate begins. I don’t know\\nthese streets at all. Hills it seems, and still houses, and houses....\\nAnd in the houses always people and people.... How many of them, no\\nend, and all hating each other! Come, let me try and think what I want,\\nto make me happy. Well? Suppose I am divorced, and Alexey\\nAlexandrovitch lets me have Seryozha, and I marry Vronsky.” Thinking of\\nAlexey Alexandrovitch, she at once pictured him with extraordinary\\nvividness as though he were alive before her, with his mild, lifeless,\\ndull eyes, the blue veins in his white hands, his intonations and the\\ncracking of his fingers, and remembering the feeling which had existed\\nbetween them, and which was also called love, she shuddered with\\nloathing. “Well, I’m divorced, and become Vronsky’s wife. Well, will\\nKitty cease looking at me as she looked at me today? No. And will\\nSeryozha leave off asking and wondering about my two husbands? And is\\nthere any new feeling I can awaken between Vronsky and me? Is there\\npossible, if not happiness, some sort of ease from misery? No, no!” she\\nanswered now without the slightest hesitation. “Impossible! We are\\ndrawn apart by life, and I make his unhappiness, and he mine, and\\nthere’s no altering him or me. Every attempt has been made, the screw\\nhas come unscrewed. Oh, a beggar woman with a baby. She thinks I’m\\nsorry for her. Aren’t we all flung into the world only to hate each\\nother, and so to torture ourselves and each other? Schoolboys\\ncoming—laughing Seryozha?” she thought. “I thought, too, that I loved\\nhim, and used to be touched by my own tenderness. But I have lived\\nwithout him, I gave him up for another love, and did not regret the\\nexchange till that love was satisfied.” And with loathing she thought\\nof what she meant by that love. And the clearness with which she saw\\nlife now, her own and all men’s, was a pleasure to her. “It’s so with\\nme and Pyotr, and the coachman, Fyodor, and that merchant, and all the\\npeople living along the Volga, where those placards invite one to go,\\nand everywhere and always,” she thought when she had driven under the\\nlow-pitched roof of the Nizhigorod station, and the porters ran to meet\\nher.\\n\\n“A ticket to Obiralovka?” said Pyotr.\\n\\nShe had utterly forgotten where and why she was going, and only by a\\ngreat effort she understood the question.\\n\\n“Yes,” she said, handing him her purse, and taking a little red bag in\\nher hand, she got out of the carriage.\\n\\nMaking her way through the crowd to the first-class waiting-room, she\\ngradually recollected all the details of her position, and the plans\\nbetween which she was hesitating. And again at the old sore places,\\nhope and then despair poisoned the wounds of her tortured, fearfully\\nthrobbing heart. As she sat on the star-shaped sofa waiting for the\\ntrain, she gazed with aversion at the people coming and going (they\\nwere all hateful to her), and thought how she would arrive at the\\nstation, would write him a note, and what she would write to him, and\\nhow he was at this moment complaining to his mother of his position,\\nnot understanding her sufferings, and how she would go into the room,\\nand what she would say to him. Then she thought that life might still\\nbe happy, and how miserably she loved and hated him, and how fearfully\\nher heart was beating 31\\n\\nA bell rang, some young men, ugly and impudent, and at the same time\\ncareful of the impression they were making, hurried by. Pyotr, too,\\ncrossed the room in his livery and top-boots, with his dull, animal\\nface, and came up to her to take her to the train. Some noisy men were\\nquiet as she passed them on the platform, and one whispered something\\nabout her to another—something vile, no doubt. She stepped up on the\\nhigh step, and sat down in a carriage by herself on a dirty seat that\\nhad been white. Her bag lay beside her, shaken up and down by the\\nspringiness of the seat. With a foolish smile Pyotr raised his hat,\\nwith its colored band, at the window, in token of farewell; an impudent\\nconductor slammed the door and the latch. A grotesque-looking lady\\nwearing a bustle (Anna mentally undressed the woman, and was appalled\\nat her hideousness), and a little girl laughing affectedly ran down the\\nplatform.\\n\\n“Katerina Andreevna, she’s got them all, _ma tante!_” cried the girl.\\n\\n“Even the child’s hideous and affected,” thought Anna. To avoid seeing\\nanyone, she got up quickly and seated herself at the opposite window of\\nthe empty carriage. A misshapen-looking peasant covered with dirt, in a\\ncap from which his tangled hair stuck out all round, passed by that\\nwindow, stooping down to the carriage wheels. “There’s something\\nfamiliar about that hideous peasant,” thought Anna. And remembering her\\ndream, she moved away to the opposite door, shaking with terror. The\\nconductor opened the door and let in a man and his wife.\\n\\n“Do you wish to get out?”\\n\\nAnna made no answer. The conductor and her two fellow-passengers did\\nnot notice under her veil her panic-stricken face. She went back to her\\ncorner and sat down. The couple seated themselves on the opposite side,\\nand intently but surreptitiously scrutinized her clothes. Both husband\\nand wife seemed repulsive to Anna. The husband asked, would she allow\\nhim to smoke, obviously not with a view to smoking but to getting into\\nconversation with her. Receiving her assent, he said to his wife in\\nFrench something about caring less to smoke than to talk. They made\\ninane and affected remarks to one another, entirely for her benefit.\\nAnna saw clearly that they were sick of each other, and hated each\\nother. And no one could have helped hating such miserable\\nmonstrosities.\\n\\nA second bell sounded, and was followed by moving of luggage, noise,\\nshouting and laughter. It was so clear to Anna that there was nothing\\nfor anyone to be glad of, that this laughter irritated her agonizingly,\\nand she would have liked to stop up her ears not to hear it. At last\\nthe third bell rang, there was a whistle and a hiss of steam, and a\\nclank of chains, and the man in her carriage crossed himself. “It would\\nbe interesting to ask him what meaning he attaches to that,” thought\\nAnna, looking angrily at him. She looked past the lady out of the\\nwindow at the people who seemed whirling by as they ran beside the\\ntrain or stood on the platform. The train, jerking at regular intervals\\nat the junctions of the rails, rolled by the platform, past a stone\\nwall, a signal-box, past other trains; the wheels, moving more smoothly\\nand evenly, resounded with a slight clang on the rails. The window was\\nlighted up by the bright evening sun, and a slight breeze fluttered the\\ncurtain. Anna forgot her fellow passengers, and to the light swaying of\\nthe train she fell to thinking again, as she breathed the fresh air.\\n\\n“Yes, what did I stop at? That I couldn’t conceive a position in which\\nlife would not be a misery, that we are all created to be miserable,\\nand that we all know it, and all invent means of deceiving each other.\\nAnd when one sees the truth, what is one to do?”\\n\\n“That’s what reason is given man for, to escape from what worries him,”\\nsaid the lady in French, lisping affectedly, and obviously pleased with\\nher phrase.\\n\\nThe words seemed an answer to Anna’s thoughts.\\n\\n“To escape from what worries him,” repeated Anna. And glancing at the\\nred-cheeked husband and the thin wife, she saw that the sickly wife\\nconsidered herself misunderstood, and the husband deceived her and\\nencouraged her in that idea of herself. Anna seemed to see all their\\nhistory and all the crannies of their souls, as it were turning a light\\nupon them. But there was nothing interesting in them, and she pursued\\nher thought.\\n\\n“Yes, I’m very much worried, and that’s what reason was given me for,\\nto escape; so then one must escape: why not put out the light when\\nthere’s nothing more to look at, when it’s sickening to look at it all?\\nBut how? Why did the conductor run along the footboard, why are they\\nshrieking, those young men in that train? why are they talking, why are\\nthey laughing? It’s all falsehood, all lying, all humbug, all\\ncruelty!...”\\n\\nWhen the train came into the station, Anna got out into the crowd of\\npassengers, and moving apart from them as if they were lepers, she\\nstood on the platform, trying to think what she had come here for, and\\nwhat she meant to do. Everything that had seemed to her possible before\\nwas now so difficult to consider, especially in this noisy crowd of\\nhideous people who would not leave her alone. One moment porters ran up\\nto her proffering their services, then young men, clacking their heels\\non the planks of the platform and talking loudly, stared at her; people\\nmeeting her dodged past on the wrong side. Remembering that she had\\nmeant to go on further if there were no answer, she stopped a porter\\nand asked if her coachman were not here with a note from Count Vronsky.\\n\\n“Count Vronsky? They sent up here from the Vronskys just this minute,\\nto meet Princess Sorokina and her daughter. And what is the coachman\\nlike?”\\n\\nJust as she was talking to the porter, the coachman Mihail, red and\\ncheerful in his smart blue coat and chain, evidently proud of having so\\nsuccessfully performed his commission, came up to her and gave her a\\nletter. She broke it open, and her heart ached before she had read it.\\n\\n“I am very sorry your note did not reach me. I will be home at ten,”\\nVronsky had written carelessly....\\n\\n“Yes, that’s what I expected!” she said to herself with an evil smile.\\n\\n“Very good, you can go home then,” she said softly, addressing Mihail.\\nShe spoke softly because the rapidity of her heart’s beating hindered\\nher breathing. “No, I won’t let you make me miserable,” she thought\\nmenacingly, addressing not him, not herself, but the power that made\\nher suffer, and she walked along the platform.\\n\\nTwo maid-servants walking along the platform turned their heads,\\nstaring at her and making some remarks about her dress. “Real,” they\\nsaid of the lace she was wearing. The young men would not leave her in\\npeace. Again they passed by, peering into her face, and with a laugh\\nshouting something in an unnatural voice. The station-master coming up\\nasked her whether she was going by train. A boy selling kvas never took\\nhis eyes off her. “My God! where am I to go?” she thought, going\\nfarther and farther along the platform. At the end she stopped. Some\\nladies and children, who had come to meet a gentleman in spectacles,\\npaused in their loud laughter and talking, and stared at her as she\\nreached them. She quickened her pace and walked away from them to the\\nedge of the platform. A luggage train was coming in. The platform began\\nto sway, and she fancied she was in the train again.\\n\\nAnd all at once she thought of the man crushed by the train the day she\\nhad first met Vronsky, and she knew what she had to do. With a rapid,\\nlight step she went down the steps that led from the tank to the rails\\nand stopped quite near the approaching train.\\n\\nShe looked at the lower part of the carriages, at the screws and chains\\nand the tall cast-iron wheel of the first carriage slowly moving up,\\nand trying to measure the middle between the front and back wheels, and\\nthe very minute when that middle point would be opposite her.\\n\\n“There,” she said to herself, looking into the shadow of the carriage,\\nat the sand and coal dust which covered the sleepers—“there, in the\\nvery middle, and I will punish him and escape from everyone and from\\nmyself.”\\n\\nShe tried to fling herself below the wheels of the first carriage as it\\nreached her; but the red bag which she tried to drop out of her hand\\ndelayed her, and she was too late; she missed the moment. She had to\\nwait for the next carriage. A feeling such as she had known when about\\nto take the first plunge in bathing came upon her, and she crossed\\nherself. That familiar gesture brought back into her soul a whole\\nseries of girlish and childish memories, and suddenly the darkness that\\nhad covered everything for her was torn apart, and life rose up before\\nher for an instant with all its bright past joys. But she did not take\\nher eyes from the wheels of the second carriage. And exactly at the\\nmoment when the space between the wheels came opposite her, she dropped\\nthe red bag, and drawing her head back into her shoulders, fell on her\\nhands under the carriage, and lightly, as though she would rise again\\nat once, dropped on to her knees. And at the same instant she was\\nterror-stricken at what she was doing. “Where am I? What am I doing?\\nWhat for?” She tried to get up, to drop backwards; but something huge\\nand merciless struck her on the head and rolled her on her back. “Lord,\\nforgive me all!” she said, feeling it impossible to struggle. A peasant\\nmuttering something was working at the iron above her. And the light by\\nwhich she had read the book filled with troubles, falsehoods, sorrow,\\nand evil, flared up more brightly than ever before, lighted up for her\\nall that had been in darkness, flickered, began to grow dim, and was\\nquenched forever.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPART EIGHT 1\\n\\n\\nAlmost two months had passed. The hot summer was half over, but Sergey\\nIvanovitch was only just preparing to leave Moscow.\\n\\nSergey Ivanovitch’s life had not been uneventful during this time. A\\nyear ago he had finished his book, the fruit of six years’ labor,\\n“Sketch of a Survey of the Principles and Forms of Government in Europe\\nand Russia.” Several sections of this book and its introduction had\\nappeared in periodical publications, and other parts had been read by\\nSergey Ivanovitch to persons of his circle, so that the leading ideas\\nof the work could not be completely novel to the public. But still\\nSergey Ivanovitch had expected that on its appearance his book would be\\nsure to make a serious impression on society, and if it did not cause a\\nrevolution in social science it would, at any rate, make a great stir\\nin the scientific world.\\n\\nAfter the most conscientious revision the book had last year been\\npublished, and had been distributed among the booksellers.\\n\\nThough he asked no one about it, reluctantly and with feigned\\nindifference answered his friends’ inquiries as to how the book was\\ngoing, and did not even inquire of the booksellers how the book was\\nselling, Sergey Ivanovitch was all on the alert, with strained\\nattention, watching for the first impression his book would make in the\\nworld and in literature.\\n\\nBut a week passed, a second, a third, and in society no impression\\nwhatever could be detected. His friends who were specialists and\\nsavants, occasionally—unmistakably from politeness—alluded to it. The\\nrest of his acquaintances, not interested in a book on a learned\\nsubject, did not talk of it at all. And society generally—just now\\nespecially absorbed in other things—was absolutely indifferent. In the\\npress, too, for a whole month there was not a word about his book.\\n\\nSergey Ivanovitch had calculated to a nicety the time necessary for\\nwriting a review, but a month passed, and a second, and still there was\\nsilence.\\n\\nOnly in the _Northern Beetle_, in a comic article on the singer\\nDrabanti, who had lost his voice, there was a contemptuous allusion to\\nKoznishev’s book, suggesting that the book had been long ago seen\\nthrough by everyone, and was a subject of general ridicule.\\n\\nAt last in the third month a critical article appeared in a serious\\nreview. Sergey Ivanovitch knew the author of the article. He had met\\nhim once at Golubtsov’s.\\n\\nThe author of the article was a young man, an invalid, very bold as a\\nwriter, but extremely deficient in breeding and shy in personal\\nrelations.\\n\\nIn spite of his absolute contempt for the author, it was with complete\\nrespect that Sergey Ivanovitch set about reading the article. The\\narticle was awful.\\n\\nThe critic had undoubtedly put an interpretation upon the book which\\ncould not possibly be put on it. But he had selected quotations so\\nadroitly that for people who had not read the book (and obviously\\nscarcely anyone had read it) it seemed absolutely clear that the whole\\nbook was nothing but a medley of high-flown phrases, not even—as\\nsuggested by marks of interrogation—used appropriately, and that the\\nauthor of the book was a person absolutely without knowledge of the\\nsubject. And all this was so wittily done that Sergey Ivanovitch would\\nnot have disowned such wit himself. But that was just what was so\\nawful.\\n\\nIn spite of the scrupulous conscientiousness with which Sergey\\nIvanovitch verified the correctness of the critic’s arguments, he did\\nnot for a minute stop to ponder over the faults and mistakes which were\\nridiculed; but unconsciously he began immediately trying to recall\\nevery detail of his meeting and conversation with the author of the\\narticle.\\n\\n“Didn’t I offend him in some way?” Sergey Ivanovitch wondered.\\n\\nAnd remembering that when they met he had corrected the young man about\\nsomething he had said that betrayed ignorance, Sergey Ivanovitch found\\nthe clue to explain the article.\\n\\nThis article was followed by a deadly silence about the book both in\\nthe press and in conversation, and Sergey Ivanovitch saw that his six\\nyears’ task, toiled at with such love and labor, had gone, leaving no\\ntrace.\\n\\nSergey Ivanovitch’s position was still more difficult from the fact\\nthat, since he had finished his book, he had had no more literary work\\nto do, such as had hitherto occupied the greater part of his time.\\n\\nSergey Ivanovitch was clever, cultivated, healthy, and energetic, and\\nhe did not know what use to make of his energy. Conversations in\\ndrawing-rooms, in meetings, assemblies, and committees—everywhere where\\ntalk was possible—took up part of his time. But being used for years to\\ntown life, he did not waste all his energies in talk, as his less\\nexperienced younger brother did, when he was in Moscow. He had a great\\ndeal of leisure and intellectual energy still to dispose of.\\n\\nFortunately for him, at this period so difficult for him from the\\nfailure of his book, the various public questions of the dissenting\\nsects, of the American alliance, of the Samara famine, of exhibitions,\\nand of spiritualism, were definitely replaced in public interest by the\\nSlavonic question, which had hitherto rather languidly interested\\nsociety, and Sergey Ivanovitch, who had been one of the first to raise\\nthis subject, threw himself into it heart and soul.\\n\\nIn the circle to which Sergey Ivanovitch belonged, nothing was talked\\nof or written about just now but the Servian War. Everything that the\\nidle crowd usually does to kill time was done now for the benefit of\\nthe Slavonic States. Balls, concerts, dinners, matchboxes, ladies’\\ndresses, beer, restaurants—everything testified to sympathy with the\\nSlavonic peoples.\\n\\nFrom much of what was spoken and written on the subject, Sergey\\nIvanovitch differed on various points. He saw that the Slavonic\\nquestion had become one of those fashionable distractions which succeed\\none another in providing society with an object and an occupation. He\\nsaw, too, that a great many people were taking up the subject from\\nmotives of self-interest and self-advertisement. He recognized that the\\nnewspapers published a great deal that was superfluous and exaggerated,\\nwith the sole aim of attracting attention and outbidding one another.\\nHe saw that in this general movement those who thrust themselves most\\nforward and shouted the loudest were men who had failed and were\\nsmarting under a sense of injury—generals without armies, ministers not\\nin the ministry, journalists not on any paper, party leaders without\\nfollowers. He saw that there was a great deal in it that was frivolous\\nand absurd. But he saw and recognized an unmistakable growing\\nenthusiasm, uniting all classes, with which it was impossible not to\\nsympathize. The massacre of men who were fellow Christians, and of the\\nsame Slavonic race, excited sympathy for the sufferers and indignation\\nagainst the oppressors. And the heroism of the Servians and\\nMontenegrins struggling for a great cause begot in the whole people a\\nlonging to help their brothers not in word but in deed.\\n\\nBut in this there was another aspect that rejoiced Sergey Ivanovitch.\\nThat was the manifestation of public opinion. The public had definitely\\nexpressed its desire. The soul of the people had, as Sergey Ivanovitch\\nsaid, found expression. And the more he worked in this cause, the more\\nincontestable it seemed to him that it was a cause destined to assume\\nvast dimensions, to create an epoch.\\n\\nHe threw himself heart and soul into the service of this great cause,\\nand forgot to think about his book. His whole time now was engrossed by\\nit, so that he could scarcely manage to answer all the letters and\\nappeals addressed to him. He worked the whole spring and part of the\\nsummer, and it was only in July that he prepared to go away to his\\nbrother’s in the country.\\n\\nHe was going both to rest for a fortnight, and in the very heart of the\\npeople, in the farthest wilds of the country, to enjoy the sight of\\nthat uplifting of the spirit of the people, of which, like all\\nresidents in the capital and big towns, he was fully persuaded.\\nKatavasov had long been meaning to carry out his promise to stay with\\nLevin, and so he was going with him 2\\n\\nSergey Ivanovitch and Katavasov had only just reached the station of\\nthe Kursk line, which was particularly busy and full of people that\\nday, when, looking round for the groom who was following with their\\nthings, they saw a party of volunteers driving up in four cabs. Ladies\\nmet them with bouquets of flowers, and followed by the rushing crowd\\nthey went into the station.\\n\\nOne of the ladies, who had met the volunteers, came out of the hall and\\naddressed Sergey Ivanovitch.\\n\\n“You too come to see them off?” she asked in French.\\n\\n“No, I’m going away myself, princess. To my brother’s for a holiday. Do\\nyou always see them off?” said Sergey Ivanovitch with a hardly\\nperceptible smile.\\n\\n“Oh, that would be impossible!” answered the princess. “Is it true that\\neight hundred have been sent from us already? Malvinsky wouldn’t\\nbelieve me.”\\n\\n“More than eight hundred. If you reckon those who have been sent not\\ndirectly from Moscow, over a thousand,” answered Sergey Ivanovitch.\\n\\n“There! That’s just what I said!” exclaimed the lady. “And it’s true\\ntoo, I suppose, that more than a million has been subscribed?”\\n\\n“Yes, princess.”\\n\\n“What do you say to today’s telegram? Beaten the Turks again.”\\n\\n“Yes, so I saw,” answered Sergey Ivanovitch. They were speaking of the\\nlast telegram stating that the Turks had been for three days in\\nsuccession beaten at all points and put to flight, and that tomorrow a\\ndecisive engagement was expected.\\n\\n“Ah, by the way, a splendid young fellow has asked leave to go, and\\nthey’ve made some difficulty, I don’t know why. I meant to ask you; I\\nknow him; please write a note about his case. He’s being sent by\\nCountess Lidia Ivanovna.”\\n\\nSergey Ivanovitch asked for all the details the princess knew about the\\nyoung man, and going into the first-class waiting-room, wrote a note to\\nthe person on whom the granting of leave of absence depended, and\\nhanded it to the princess.\\n\\n“You know Count Vronsky, the notorious one ... is going by this train?”\\nsaid the princess with a smile full of triumph and meaning, when he\\nfound her again and gave her the letter.\\n\\n“I had heard he was going, but I did not know when. By this train?”\\n\\n“I’ve seen him. He’s here: there’s only his mother seeing him off. It’s\\nthe best thing, anyway, that he could do.”\\n\\n“Oh, yes, of course.”\\n\\nWhile they were talking the crowd streamed by them into the\\ndining-room. They went forward too, and heard a gentleman with a glass\\nin his hand delivering a loud discourse to the volunteers. “In the\\nservice of religion, humanity, and our brothers,” the gentleman said,\\nhis voice growing louder and louder; “to this great cause mother Moscow\\ndedicates you with her blessing. _Jivio!_” he concluded, loudly and\\ntearfully.\\n\\nEveryone shouted _Jivio!_ and a fresh crowd dashed into the hall,\\nalmost carrying the princess off her legs.\\n\\n“Ah, princess! that was something like!” said Stepan Arkadyevitch,\\nsuddenly appearing in the middle of the crowd and beaming upon them\\nwith a delighted smile. “Capitally, warmly said, wasn’t it? Bravo! And\\nSergey Ivanovitch! Why, you ought to have said something—just a few\\nwords, you know, to encourage them; you do that so well,” he added with\\na soft, respectful, and discreet smile, moving Sergey Ivanovitch\\nforward a little by the arm.\\n\\n“No, I’m just off.”\\n\\n“Where to?”\\n\\n“To the country, to my brother’s,” answered Sergey Ivanovitch.\\n\\n“Then you’ll see my wife. I’ve written to her, but you’ll see her\\nfirst. Please tell her that they’ve seen me and that it’s ‘all right,’\\nas the English say. She’ll understand. Oh, and be so good as to tell\\nher I’m appointed secretary of the committee.... But she’ll understand!\\nYou know, _les petites misères de la vie humaine,_” he said, as it were\\napologizing to the princess. “And Princess Myakaya—not Liza, but\\nBibish—is sending a thousand guns and twelve nurses. Did I tell you?”\\n\\n“Yes, I heard so,” answered Koznishev indifferently.\\n\\n“It’s a pity you’re going away,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch. “Tomorrow\\nwe’re giving a dinner to two who’re setting off—Dimer-Bartnyansky from\\nPetersburg and our Veslovsky, Grisha. They’re both going. Veslovsky’s\\nonly lately married. There’s a fine fellow for you! Eh, princess?” he\\nturned to the lady.\\n\\nThe princess looked at Koznishev without replying. But the fact that\\nSergey Ivanovitch and the princess seemed anxious to get rid of him did\\nnot in the least disconcert Stepan Arkadyevitch. Smiling, he stared at\\nthe feather in the princess’s hat, and then about him as though he were\\ngoing to pick something up. Seeing a lady approaching with a collecting\\nbox, he beckoned her up and put in a five-rouble note.\\n\\n“I can never see these collecting boxes unmoved while I’ve money in my\\npocket,” he said. “And how about today’s telegram? Fine chaps those\\nMontenegrins!”\\n\\n“You don’t say so!” he cried, when the princess told him that Vronsky\\nwas going by this train. For an instant Stepan Arkadyevitch’s face\\nlooked sad, but a minute later, when, stroking his mustaches and\\nswinging as he walked, he went into the hall where Vronsky was, he had\\ncompletely forgotten his own despairing sobs over his sister’s corpse,\\nand he saw in Vronsky only a hero and an old friend.\\n\\n“With all his faults one can’t refuse to do him justice,” said the\\nprincess to Sergey Ivanovitch as soon as Stepan Arkadyevitch had left\\nthem. “What a typically Russian, Slav nature! Only, I’m afraid it won’t\\nbe pleasant for Vronsky to see him. Say what you will, I’m touched by\\nthat man’s fate. Do talk to him a little on the way,” said the\\nprincess.\\n\\n“Yes, perhaps, if it happens so.”\\n\\n“I never liked him. But this atones for a great deal. He’s not merely\\ngoing himself, he’s taking a squadron at his own expense.”\\n\\n“Yes, so I heard.”\\n\\nA bell sounded. Everyone crowded to the doors. “Here he is!” said the\\nprincess, indicating Vronsky, who with his mother on his arm walked by,\\nwearing a long overcoat and wide-brimmed black hat. Oblonsky was\\nwalking beside him, talking eagerly of something.\\n\\nVronsky was frowning and looking straight before him, as though he did\\nnot hear what Stepan Arkadyevitch was saying.\\n\\nProbably on Oblonsky’s pointing them out, he looked round in the\\ndirection where the princess and Sergey Ivanovitch were standing, and\\nwithout speaking lifted his hat. His face, aged and worn by suffering,\\nlooked stony.\\n\\nGoing onto the platform, Vronsky left his mother and disappeared into a\\ncompartment.\\n\\nOn the platform there rang out “God save the Tsar,” then shouts of\\n“hurrah!” and _“jivio!”_ One of the volunteers, a tall, very young man\\nwith a hollow chest, was particularly conspicuous, bowing and waving\\nhis felt hat and a nosegay over his head. Then two officers emerged,\\nbowing too, and a stout man with a big beard, wearing a greasy forage\\ncap 3\\n\\nSaying good-bye to the princess, Sergey Ivanovitch was joined by\\nKatavasov; together they got into a carriage full to overflowing, and\\nthe train started.\\n\\nAt Tsaritsino station the train was met by a chorus of young men\\nsinging “Hail to Thee!” Again the volunteers bowed and poked their\\nheads out, but Sergey Ivanovitch paid no attention to them. He had had\\nso much to do with the volunteers that the type was familiar to him and\\ndid not interest him. Katavasov, whose scientific work had prevented\\nhis having a chance of observing them hitherto, was very much\\ninterested in them and questioned Sergey Ivanovitch.\\n\\nSergey Ivanovitch advised him to go into the second-class and talk to\\nthem himself. At the next station Katavasov acted on this suggestion.\\n\\nAt the first stop he moved into the second-class and made the\\nacquaintance of the volunteers. They were sitting in a corner of the\\ncarriage, talking loudly and obviously aware that the attention of the\\npassengers and Katavasov as he got in was concentrated upon them. More\\nloudly than all talked the tall, hollow-chested young man. He was\\nunmistakably tipsy, and was relating some story that had occurred at\\nhis school. Facing him sat a middle-aged officer in the Austrian\\nmilitary jacket of the Guards uniform. He was listening with a smile to\\nthe hollow-chested youth, and occasionally pulling him up. The third,\\nin an artillery uniform, was sitting on a box beside them. A fourth was\\nasleep.\\n\\nEntering into conversation with the youth, Katavasov learned that he\\nwas a wealthy Moscow merchant who had run through a large fortune\\nbefore he was two-and-twenty. Katavasov did not like him, because he\\nwas unmanly and effeminate and sickly. He was obviously convinced,\\nespecially now after drinking, that he was performing a heroic action,\\nand he bragged of it in the most unpleasant way.\\n\\nThe second, the retired officer, made an unpleasant impression too upon\\nKatavasov. He was, it seemed, a man who had tried everything. He had\\nbeen on a railway, had been a land-steward, and had started factories,\\nand he talked, quite without necessity, of all he had done, and used\\nlearned expressions quite inappropriately.\\n\\nThe third, the artilleryman, on the contrary, struck Katavasov very\\nfavorably. He was a quiet, modest fellow, unmistakably impressed by the\\nknowledge of the officer and the heroic self-sacrifice of the merchant\\nand saying nothing about himself. When Katavasov asked him what had\\nimpelled him to go to Servia, he answered modestly:\\n\\n“Oh, well, everyone’s going. The Servians want help, too. I’m sorry for\\nthem.”\\n\\n“Yes, you artillerymen especially are scarce there,” said Katavasov.\\n\\n“Oh, I wasn’t long in the artillery, maybe they’ll put me into the\\ninfantry or the cavalry.”\\n\\n“Into the infantry when they need artillery more than anything?” said\\nKatavasov, fancying from the artilleryman’s apparent age that he must\\nhave reached a fairly high grade.\\n\\n“I wasn’t long in the artillery; I’m a cadet retired,” he said, and he\\nbegan to explain how he had failed in his examination.\\n\\nAll of this together made a disagreeable impression on Katavasov, and\\nwhen the volunteers got out at a station for a drink, Katavasov would\\nhave liked to compare his unfavorable impression in conversation with\\nsomeone. There was an old man in the carriage, wearing a military\\novercoat, who had been listening all the while to Katavasov’s\\nconversation with the volunteers. When they were left alone, Katavasov\\naddressed him.\\n\\n“What different positions they come from, all those fellows who are\\ngoing off there,” Katavasov said vaguely, not wishing to express his\\nown opinion, and at the same time anxious to find out the old man’s\\nviews.\\n\\nThe old man was an officer who had served on two campaigns. He knew\\nwhat makes a soldier, and judging by the appearance and the talk of\\nthose persons, by the swagger with which they had recourse to the\\nbottle on the journey, he considered them poor soldiers. Moreover, he\\nlived in a district town, and he was longing to tell how one soldier\\nhad volunteered from his town, a drunkard and a thief whom no one would\\nemploy as a laborer. But knowing by experience that in the present\\ncondition of the public temper it was dangerous to express an opinion\\nopposed to the general one, and especially to criticize the volunteers\\nunfavorably, he too watched Katavasov without committing himself.\\n\\n“Well, men are wanted there,” he said, laughing with his eyes. And they\\nfell to talking of the last war news, and each concealed from the other\\nhis perplexity as to the engagement expected next day, since the Turks\\nhad been beaten, according to the latest news, at all points. And so\\nthey parted, neither giving expression to his opinion.\\n\\nKatavasov went back to his own carriage, and with reluctant hypocrisy\\nreported to Sergey Ivanovitch his observations of the volunteers, from\\nwhich it would appear that they were capital fellows.\\n\\nAt a big station at a town the volunteers were again greeted with\\nshouts and singing, again men and women with collecting boxes appeared,\\nand provincial ladies brought bouquets to the volunteers and followed\\nthem into the refreshment room; but all this was on a much smaller and\\nfeebler scale than in Moscow 4\\n\\nWhile the train was stopping at the provincial town, Sergey Ivanovitch\\ndid not go to the refreshment room, but walked up and down the\\nplatform.\\n\\nThe first time he passed Vronsky’s compartment he noticed that the\\ncurtain was drawn over the window; but as he passed it the second time\\nhe saw the old countess at the window. She beckoned to Koznishev.\\n\\n“I’m going, you see, taking him as far as Kursk,” she said.\\n\\n“Yes, so I heard,” said Sergey Ivanovitch, standing at her window and\\npeeping in. “What a noble act on his part!” he added, noticing that\\nVronsky was not in the compartment.\\n\\n“Yes, after his misfortune, what was there for him to do?”\\n\\n“What a terrible thing it was!” said Sergey Ivanovitch.\\n\\n“Ah, what I have been through! But do get in.... Ah, what I have been\\nthrough!” she repeated, when Sergey Ivanovitch had got in and sat down\\nbeside her. “You can’t conceive it! For six weeks he did not speak to\\nanyone, and would not touch food except when I implored him. And not\\nfor one minute could we leave him alone. We took away everything he\\ncould have used against himself. We lived on the ground floor, but\\nthere was no reckoning on anything. You know, of course, that he had\\nshot himself once already on her account,” she said, and the old lady’s\\neyelashes twitched at the recollection. “Yes, hers was the fitting end\\nfor such a woman. Even the death she chose was low and vulgar.”\\n\\n“It’s not for us to judge, countess,” said Sergey Ivanovitch; “but I\\ncan understand that it has been very hard for you.”\\n\\n“Ah, don’t speak of it! I was staying on my estate, and he was with me.\\nA note was brought him. He wrote an answer and sent it off. We hadn’t\\nan idea that she was close by at the station. In the evening I had only\\njust gone to my room, when my Mary told me a lady had thrown herself\\nunder the train. Something seemed to strike me at once. I knew it was\\nshe. The first thing I said was, he was not to be told. But they’d told\\nhim already. His coachman was there and saw it all. When I ran into his\\nroom, he was beside himself—it was fearful to see him. He didn’t say a\\nword, but galloped off there. I don’t know to this day what happened\\nthere, but he was brought back at death’s door. I shouldn’t have known\\nhim. _Prostration complète,_ the doctor said. And that was followed\\nalmost by madness. Oh, why talk of it!” said the countess with a wave\\nof her hand. “It was an awful time! No, say what you will, she was a\\nbad woman. Why, what is the meaning of such desperate passions? It was\\nall to show herself something out of the way. Well, and that she did\\ndo. She brought herself to ruin and two good men—her husband and my\\nunhappy son.”\\n\\n“And what did her husband do?” asked Sergey Ivanovitch.\\n\\n“He has taken her daughter. Alexey was ready to agree to anything at\\nfirst. Now it worries him terribly that he should have given his own\\nchild away to another man. But he can’t take back his word. Karenin\\ncame to the funeral. But we tried to prevent his meeting Alexey. For\\nhim, for her husband, it was easier, anyway. She had set him free. But\\nmy poor son was utterly given up to her. He had thrown up everything,\\nhis career, me, and even then she had no mercy on him, but of set\\npurpose she made his ruin complete. No, say what you will, her very\\ndeath was the death of a vile woman, of no religious feeling. God\\nforgive me, but I can’t help hating the memory of her, when I look at\\nmy son’s misery!”\\n\\n“But how is he now?”\\n\\n“It was a blessing from Providence for us—this Servian war. I’m old,\\nand I don’t understand the rights and wrongs of it, but it’s come as a\\nprovidential blessing to him. Of course for me, as his mother, it’s\\nterrible; and what’s worse, they say, _ce n’est pas très bien vu à\\nPétersbourg_. But it can’t be helped! It was the one thing that could\\nrouse him. Yashvin—a friend of his—he had lost all he had at cards and\\nhe was going to Servia. He came to see him and persuaded him to go. Now\\nit’s an interest for him. Do please talk to him a little. I want to\\ndistract his mind. He’s so low-spirited. And as bad luck would have it,\\nhe has toothache too. But he’ll be delighted to see you. Please do talk\\nto him; he’s walking up and down on that side.”\\n\\nSergey Ivanovitch said he would be very glad to, and crossed over to\\nthe other side of the station 5\\n\\nIn the slanting evening shadows cast by the baggage piled up on the\\nplatform, Vronsky in his long overcoat and slouch hat, with his hands\\nin his pockets, strode up and down, like a wild beast in a cage,\\nturning sharply after twenty paces. Sergey Ivanovitch fancied, as he\\napproached him, that Vronsky saw him but was pretending not to see.\\nThis did not affect Sergey Ivanovitch in the slightest. He was above\\nall personal considerations with Vronsky.\\n\\nAt that moment Sergey Ivanovitch looked upon Vronsky as a man taking an\\nimportant part in a great cause, and Koznishev thought it his duty to\\nencourage him and express his approval. He went up to him.\\n\\nVronsky stood still, looked intently at him, recognized him, and going\\na few steps forward to meet him, shook hands with him very warmly.\\n\\n“Possibly you didn’t wish to see me,” said Sergey Ivanovitch, “but\\ncouldn’t I be of use to you?”\\n\\n“There’s no one I should less dislike seeing than you,” said Vronsky.\\n“Excuse me; and there’s nothing in life for me to like.”\\n\\n“I quite understand, and I merely meant to offer you my services,” said\\nSergey Ivanovitch, scanning Vronsky’s face, full of unmistakable\\nsuffering. “Wouldn’t it be of use to you to have a letter to\\nRistitch—to Milan?”\\n\\n“Oh, no!” Vronsky said, seeming to understand him with difficulty. “If\\nyou don’t mind, let’s walk on. It’s so stuffy among the carriages. A\\nletter? No, thank you; to meet death one needs no letters of\\nintroduction. Nor for the Turks....” he said, with a smile that was\\nmerely of the lips. His eyes still kept their look of angry suffering.\\n\\n“Yes; but you might find it easier to get into relations, which are\\nafter all essential, with anyone prepared to see you. But that’s as you\\nlike. I was very glad to hear of your intention. There have been so\\nmany attacks made on the volunteers, and a man like you raises them in\\npublic estimation.”\\n\\n“My use as a man,” said Vronsky, “is that life’s worth nothing to me.\\nAnd that I’ve enough bodily energy to cut my way into their ranks, and\\nto trample on them or fall—I know that. I’m glad there’s something to\\ngive my life for, for it’s not simply useless but loathsome to me.\\nAnyone’s welcome to it.” And his jaw twitched impatiently from the\\nincessant gnawing toothache, that prevented him from even speaking with\\na natural expression.\\n\\n“You will become another man, I predict,” said Sergey Ivanovitch,\\nfeeling touched. “To deliver one’s brother-men from bondage is an aim\\nworth death and life. God grant you success outwardly—and inwardly\\npeace,” he added, and he held out his hand. Vronsky warmly pressed his\\noutstretched hand.\\n\\n“Yes, as a weapon I may be of some use. But as a man, I’m a wreck,” he\\njerked out.\\n\\nHe could hardly speak for the throbbing ache in his strong teeth, that\\nwere like rows of ivory in his mouth. He was silent, and his eyes\\nrested on the wheels of the tender, slowly and smoothly rolling along\\nthe rails.\\n\\nAnd all at once a different pain, not an ache, but an inner trouble,\\nthat set his whole being in anguish, made him for an instant forget his\\ntoothache. As he glanced at the tender and the rails, under the\\ninfluence of the conversation with a friend he had not met since his\\nmisfortune, he suddenly recalled _her_—that is, what was left of her\\nwhen he had run like one distraught into the cloak room of the railway\\nstation—on the table, shamelessly sprawling out among strangers, the\\nbloodstained body so lately full of life; the head unhurt dropping back\\nwith its weight of hair, and the curling tresses about the temples, and\\nthe exquisite face, with red, half-opened mouth, the strange, fixed\\nexpression, piteous on the lips and awful in the still open eyes, that\\nseemed to utter that fearful phrase—that he would be sorry for it—that\\nshe had said when they were quarreling.\\n\\nAnd he tried to think of her as she was when he met her the first time,\\nat a railway station too, mysterious, exquisite, loving, seeking and\\ngiving happiness, and not cruelly revengeful as he remembered her on\\nthat last moment. He tried to recall his best moments with her, but\\nthose moments were poisoned forever. He could only think of her as\\ntriumphant, successful in her menace of a wholly useless remorse never\\nto be effaced. He lost all consciousness of toothache, and his face\\nworked with sobs.\\n\\nPassing twice up and down beside the baggage in silence and regaining\\nhis self-possession, he addressed Sergey Ivanovitch calmly:\\n\\n“You have had no telegrams since yesterday’s? Yes, driven back for a\\nthird time, but a decisive engagement expected for tomorrow.”\\n\\nAnd after talking a little more of King Milan’s proclamation, and the\\nimmense effect it might have, they parted, going to their carriages on\\nhearing the second bell 6\\n\\nSergey Ivanovitch had not telegraphed to his brother to send to meet\\nhim, as he did not know when he should be able to leave Moscow. Levin\\nwas not at home when Katavasov and Sergey Ivanovitch in a fly hired at\\nthe station drove up to the steps of the Pokrovskoe house, as black as\\nMoors from the dust of the road. Kitty, sitting on the balcony with her\\nfather and sister, recognized her brother-in-law, and ran down to meet\\nhim.\\n\\n“What a shame not to have let us know,” she said, giving her hand to\\nSergey Ivanovitch, and putting her forehead up for him to kiss.\\n\\n“We drove here capitally, and have not put you out,” answered Sergey\\nIvanovitch. “I’m so dirty. I’m afraid to touch you. I’ve been so busy,\\nI didn’t know when I should be able to tear myself away. And so you’re\\nstill as ever enjoying your peaceful, quiet happiness,” he said,\\nsmiling, “out of the reach of the current in your peaceful backwater.\\nHere’s our friend Fyodor Vassilievitch who has succeeded in getting\\nhere at last.”\\n\\n“But I’m not a negro, I shall look like a human being when I wash,”\\nsaid Katavasov in his jesting fashion, and he shook hands and smiled,\\nhis teeth flashing white in his black face.\\n\\n“Kostya will be delighted. He has gone to his settlement. It’s time he\\nshould be home.”\\n\\n“Busy as ever with his farming. It really is a peaceful backwater,”\\nsaid Katavasov; “while we in town think of nothing but the Servian war.\\nWell, how does our friend look at it? He’s sure not to think like other\\npeople.”\\n\\n“Oh, I don’t know, like everybody else,” Kitty answered, a little\\nembarrassed, looking round at Sergey Ivanovitch. “I’ll send to fetch\\nhim. Papa’s staying with us. He’s only just come home from abroad.”\\n\\nAnd making arrangements to send for Levin and for the guests to wash,\\none in his room and the other in what had been Dolly’s, and giving\\norders for their luncheon, Kitty ran out onto the balcony, enjoying the\\nfreedom, and rapidity of movement, of which she had been deprived\\nduring the months of her pregnancy.\\n\\n“It’s Sergey Ivanovitch and Katavasov, a professor,” she said.\\n\\n“Oh, that’s a bore in this heat,” said the prince.\\n\\n“No, papa, he’s very nice, and Kostya’s very fond of him,” Kitty said,\\nwith a deprecating smile, noticing the irony on her father’s face.\\n\\n“Oh, I didn’t say anything.”\\n\\n“You go to them, darling,” said Kitty to her sister, “and entertain\\nthem. They saw Stiva at the station; he was quite well. And I must run\\nto Mitya. As ill-luck would have it, I haven’t fed him since tea. He’s\\nawake now, and sure to be screaming.” And feeling a rush of milk, she\\nhurried to the nursery.\\n\\nThis was not a mere guess; her connection with the child was still so\\nclose, that she could gauge by the flow of her milk his need of food,\\nand knew for certain he was hungry.\\n\\nShe knew he was crying before she reached the nursery. And he was\\nindeed crying. She heard him and hastened. But the faster she went, the\\nlouder he screamed. It was a fine healthy scream, hungry and impatient.\\n\\n“Has he been screaming long, nurse, very long?” said Kitty hurriedly,\\nseating herself on a chair, and preparing to give the baby the breast.\\n“But give me him quickly. Oh, nurse, how tiresome you are! There, tie\\nthe cap afterwards, do!”\\n\\nThe baby’s greedy scream was passing into sobs.\\n\\n“But you can’t manage so, ma’am,” said Agafea Mihalovna, who was almost\\nalways to be found in the nursery. “He must be put straight. A-oo!\\na-oo!” she chanted over him, paying no attention to the mother.\\n\\nThe nurse brought the baby to his mother. Agafea Mihalovna followed him\\nwith a face dissolving with tenderness.\\n\\n“He knows me, he knows me. In God’s faith, Katerina Alexandrovna,\\nma’am, he knew me!” Agafea Mihalovna cried above the baby’s screams.\\n\\nBut Kitty did not hear her words. Her impatience kept growing, like the\\nbaby’s.\\n\\nTheir impatience hindered things for a while. The baby could not get\\nhold of the breast right, and was furious.\\n\\nAt last, after despairing, breathless screaming, and vain sucking,\\nthings went right, and mother and child felt simultaneously soothed,\\nand both subsided into calm.\\n\\n“But poor darling, he’s all in perspiration!” said Kitty in a whisper,\\ntouching the baby.\\n\\n“What makes you think he knows you?” she added, with a sidelong glance\\nat the baby’s eyes, that peered roguishly, as she fancied, from under\\nhis cap, at his rhythmically puffing cheeks, and the little red-palmed\\nhand he was waving.\\n\\n“Impossible! If he knew anyone, he would have known me,” said Kitty, in\\nresponse to Agafea Mihalovna’s statement, and she smiled.\\n\\nShe smiled because, though she said he could not know her, in her heart\\nshe was sure that he knew not merely Agafea Mihalovna, but that he knew\\nand understood everything, and knew and understood a great deal too\\nthat no one else knew, and that she, his mother, had learned and come\\nto understand only through him. To Agafea Mihalovna, to the nurse, to\\nhis grandfather, to his father even, Mitya was a living being,\\nrequiring only material care, but for his mother he had long been a\\nmortal being, with whom there had been a whole series of spiritual\\nrelations already.\\n\\n“When he wakes up, please God, you shall see for yourself. Then when I\\ndo like this, he simply beams on me, the darling! Simply beams like a\\nsunny day!” said Agafea Mihalovna.\\n\\n“Well, well; then we shall see,” whispered Kitty. “But now go away,\\nhe’s going to sleep 7\\n\\nAgafea Mihalovna went out on tiptoe; the nurse let down the blind,\\nchased a fly out from under the muslin canopy of the crib, and a\\nbumblebee struggling on the window-frame, and sat down waving a faded\\nbranch of birch over the mother and the baby.\\n\\n“How hot it is! if God would send a drop of rain,” she said.\\n\\n“Yes, yes, sh—sh—sh——” was all Kitty answered, rocking a little, and\\ntenderly squeezing the plump little arm, with rolls of fat at the\\nwrist, which Mitya still waved feebly as he opened and shut his eyes.\\nThat hand worried Kitty; she longed to kiss the little hand, but was\\nafraid to for fear of waking the baby. At last the little hand ceased\\nwaving, and the eyes closed. Only from time to time, as he went on\\nsucking, the baby raised his long, curly eyelashes and peeped at his\\nmother with wet eyes, that looked black in the twilight. The nurse had\\nleft off fanning, and was dozing. From above came the peals of the old\\nprince’s voice, and the chuckle of Katavasov.\\n\\n“They have got into talk without me,” thought Kitty, “but still it’s\\nvexing that Kostya’s out. He’s sure to have gone to the bee-house\\nagain. Though it’s a pity he’s there so often, still I’m glad. It\\ndistracts his mind. He’s become altogether happier and better now than\\nin the spring. He used to be so gloomy and worried that I felt\\nfrightened for him. And how absurd he is!” she whispered, smiling.\\n\\nShe knew what worried her husband. It was his unbelief. Although, if\\nshe had been asked whether she supposed that in the future life, if he\\ndid not believe, he would be damned, she would have had to admit that\\nhe would be damned, his unbelief did not cause her unhappiness. And\\nshe, confessing that for an unbeliever there can be no salvation, and\\nloving her husband’s soul more than anything in the world, thought with\\na smile of his unbelief, and told herself that he was absurd.\\n\\n“What does he keep reading philosophy of some sort for all this year?”\\nshe wondered. “If it’s all written in those books, he can understand\\nthem. If it’s all wrong, why does he read them? He says himself that he\\nwould like to believe. Then why is it he doesn’t believe? Surely from\\nhis thinking so much? And he thinks so much from being solitary. He’s\\nalways alone, alone. He can’t talk about it all to us. I fancy he’ll be\\nglad of these visitors, especially Katavasov. He likes discussions with\\nthem,” she thought, and passed instantly to the consideration of where\\nit would be more convenient to put Katavasov, to sleep alone or to\\nshare Sergey Ivanovitch’s room. And then an idea suddenly struck her,\\nwhich made her shudder and even disturb Mitya, who glanced severely at\\nher. “I do believe the laundress hasn’t sent the washing yet, and all\\nthe best sheets are in use. If I don’t see to it, Agafea Mihalovna will\\ngive Sergey Ivanovitch the wrong sheets,” and at the very idea of this\\nthe blood rushed to Kitty’s face.\\n\\n“Yes, I will arrange it,” she decided, and going back to her former\\nthoughts, she remembered that some spiritual question of importance had\\nbeen interrupted, and she began to recall what. “Yes, Kostya, an\\nunbeliever,” she thought again with a smile.\\n\\n“Well, an unbeliever then! Better let him always be one than like\\nMadame Stahl, or what I tried to be in those days abroad. No, he won’t\\never sham anything.”\\n\\nAnd a recent instance of his goodness rose vividly to her mind. A\\nfortnight ago a penitent letter had come from Stepan Arkadyevitch to\\nDolly. He besought her to save his honor, to sell her estate to pay his\\ndebts. Dolly was in despair, she detested her husband, despised him,\\npitied him, resolved on a separation, resolved to refuse, but ended by\\nagreeing to sell part of her property. After that, with an\\nirrepressible smile of tenderness, Kitty recalled her husband’s\\nshamefaced embarrassment, his repeated awkward efforts to approach the\\nsubject, and how at last, having thought of the one means of helping\\nDolly without wounding her pride, he had suggested to Kitty—what had\\nnot occurred to her before—that she should give up her share of the\\nproperty.\\n\\n“He an unbeliever indeed! With his heart, his dread of offending\\nanyone, even a child! Everything for others, nothing for himself.\\nSergey Ivanovitch simply considers it as Kostya’s duty to be his\\nsteward. And it’s the same with his sister. Now Dolly and her children\\nare under his guardianship; all these peasants who come to him every\\nday, as though he were bound to be at their service.”\\n\\n“Yes, only be like your father, only like him,” she said, handing Mitya\\nover to the nurse, and putting her lips to his cheek 8\\n\\nEver since, by his beloved brother’s deathbed, Levin had first glanced\\ninto the questions of life and death in the light of these new\\nconvictions, as he called them, which had during the period from his\\ntwentieth to his thirty-fourth year imperceptibly replaced his childish\\nand youthful beliefs—he had been stricken with horror, not so much of\\ndeath, as of life, without any knowledge of whence, and why, and how,\\nand what it was. The physical organization, its decay, the\\nindestructibility of matter, the law of the conservation of energy,\\nevolution, were the words which usurped the place of his old belief.\\nThese words and the ideas associated with them were very well for\\nintellectual purposes. But for life they yielded nothing, and Levin\\nfelt suddenly like a man who has changed his warm fur cloak for a\\nmuslin garment, and going for the first time into the frost is\\nimmediately convinced, not by reason, but by his whole nature that he\\nis as good as naked, and that he must infallibly perish miserably.\\n\\nFrom that moment, though he did not distinctly face it, and still went\\non living as before, Levin had never lost this sense of terror at his\\nlack of knowledge.\\n\\nHe vaguely felt, too, that what he called his new convictions were not\\nmerely lack of knowledge, but that they were part of a whole order of\\nideas, in which no knowledge of what he needed was possible.\\n\\nAt first, marriage, with the new joys and duties bound up with it, had\\ncompletely crowded out these thoughts. But of late, while he was\\nstaying in Moscow after his wife’s confinement, with nothing to do, the\\nquestion that clamored for solution had more and more often, more and\\nmore insistently, haunted Levin’s mind.\\n\\nThe question was summed up for him thus: “If I do not accept the\\nanswers Christianity gives to the problems of my life, what answers do\\nI accept?” And in the whole arsenal of his convictions, so far from\\nfinding any satisfactory answers, he was utterly unable to find\\nanything at all like an answer.\\n\\nHe was in the position of a man seeking food in toy shops and tool\\nshops.\\n\\nInstinctively, unconsciously, with every book, with every conversation,\\nwith every man he met, he was on the lookout for light on these\\nquestions and their solution.\\n\\nWhat puzzled and distracted him above everything was that the majority\\nof men of his age and circle had, like him, exchanged their old beliefs\\nfor the same new convictions, and yet saw nothing to lament in this,\\nand were perfectly satisfied and serene. So that, apart from the\\nprincipal question, Levin was tortured by other questions too. Were\\nthese people sincere? he asked himself, or were they playing a part? or\\nwas it that they understood the answers science gave to these problems\\nin some different, clearer sense than he did? And he assiduously\\nstudied both these men’s opinions and the books which treated of these\\nscientific explanations.\\n\\nOne fact he had found out since these questions had engrossed his mind,\\nwas that he had been quite wrong in supposing from the recollections of\\nthe circle of his young days at college, that religion had outlived its\\nday, and that it was now practically non-existent. All the people\\nnearest to him who were good in their lives were believers. The old\\nprince, and Lvov, whom he liked so much, and Sergey Ivanovitch, and all\\nthe women believed, and his wife believed as simply as he had believed\\nin his earliest childhood, and ninety-nine hundredths of the Russian\\npeople, all the working people for whose life he felt the deepest\\nrespect, believed.\\n\\nAnother fact of which he became convinced, after reading many\\nscientific books, was that the men who shared his views had no other\\nconstruction to put on them, and that they gave no explanation of the\\nquestions which he felt he could not live without answering, but simply\\nignored their existence and attempted to explain other questions of no\\npossible interest to him, such as the evolution of organisms, the\\nmaterialistic theory of consciousness, and so forth.\\n\\nMoreover, during his wife’s confinement, something had happened that\\nseemed extraordinary to him. He, an unbeliever, had fallen into\\npraying, and at the moment he prayed, he believed. But that moment had\\npassed, and he could not make his state of mind at that moment fit into\\nthe rest of his life.\\n\\nHe could not admit that at that moment he knew the truth, and that now\\nhe was wrong; for as soon as he began thinking calmly about it, it all\\nfell to pieces. He could not admit that he was mistaken then, for his\\nspiritual condition then was precious to him, and to admit that it was\\na proof of weakness would have been to desecrate those moments. He was\\nmiserably divided against himself, and strained all his spiritual\\nforces to the utmost to escape from this condition 9\\n\\nThese doubts fretted and harassed him, growing weaker or stronger from\\ntime to time, but never leaving him. He read and thought, and the more\\nhe read and the more he thought, the further he felt from the aim he\\nwas pursuing.\\n\\nOf late in Moscow and in the country, since he had become convinced\\nthat he would find no solution in the materialists, he had read and\\nre-read thoroughly Plato, Spinoza, Kant, Schelling, Hegel, and\\nSchopenhauer, the philosophers who gave a non-materialistic explanation\\nof life.\\n\\nTheir ideas seemed to him fruitful when he was reading or was himself\\nseeking arguments to refute other theories, especially those of the\\nmaterialists; but as soon as he began to read or sought for himself a\\nsolution of problems, the same thing always happened. As long as he\\nfollowed the fixed definition of obscure words such as _spirit, will,\\nfreedom, essence,_ purposely letting himself go into the snare of words\\nthe philosophers set for him, he seemed to comprehend something. But he\\nhad only to forget the artificial train of reasoning, and to turn from\\nlife itself to what had satisfied him while thinking in accordance with\\nthe fixed definitions, and all this artificial edifice fell to pieces\\nat once like a house of cards, and it became clear that the edifice had\\nbeen built up out of those transposed words, apart from anything in\\nlife more important than reason.\\n\\nAt one time, reading Schopenhauer, he put in place of his _will_ the\\nword _love_, and for a couple of days this new philosophy charmed him,\\ntill he removed a little away from it. But then, when he turned from\\nlife itself to glance at it again, it fell away too, and proved to be\\nthe same muslin garment with no warmth in it.\\n\\nHis brother Sergey Ivanovitch advised him to read the theological works\\nof Homiakov. Levin read the second volume of Homiakov’s works, and in\\nspite of the elegant, epigrammatic, argumentative style which at first\\nrepelled him, he was impressed by the doctrine of the church he found\\nin them. He was struck at first by the idea that the apprehension of\\ndivine truths had not been vouchsafed to man, but to a corporation of\\nmen bound together by love—to the church. What delighted him was the\\nthought how much easier it was to believe in a still existing living\\nchurch, embracing all the beliefs of men, and having God at its head,\\nand therefore holy and infallible, and from it to accept the faith in\\nGod, in the creation, the fall, the redemption, than to begin with God,\\na mysterious, far-away God, the creation, etc. But afterwards, on\\nreading a Catholic writer’s history of the church, and then a Greek\\northodox writer’s history of the church, and seeing that the two\\nchurches, in their very conception infallible, each deny the authority\\nof the other, Homiakov’s doctrine of the church lost all its charm for\\nhim, and this edifice crumbled into dust like the philosophers’\\nedifices.\\n\\nAll that spring he was not himself, and went through fearful moments of\\nhorror.\\n\\n“Without knowing what I am and why I am here, life’s impossible; and\\nthat I can’t know, and so I can’t live,” Levin said to himself.\\n\\n“In infinite time, in infinite matter, in infinite space, is formed a\\nbubble-organism, and that bubble lasts a while and bursts, and that\\nbubble is Me.”\\n\\nIt was an agonizing error, but it was the sole logical result of ages\\nof human thought in that direction.\\n\\nThis was the ultimate belief on which all the systems elaborated by\\nhuman thought in almost all their ramifications rested. It was the\\nprevalent conviction, and of all other explanations Levin had\\nunconsciously, not knowing when or how, chosen it, as anyway the\\nclearest, and made it his own.\\n\\nBut it was not merely a falsehood, it was the cruel jeer of some wicked\\npower, some evil, hateful power, to whom one could not submit.\\n\\nHe must escape from this power. And the means of escape every man had\\nin his own hands. He had but to cut short this dependence on evil. And\\nthere was one means—death.\\n\\nAnd Levin, a happy father and husband, in perfect health, was several\\ntimes so near suicide that he hid the cord that he might not be tempted\\nto hang himself, and was afraid to go out with his gun for fear of\\nshooting himself.\\n\\nBut Levin did not shoot himself, and did not hang himself; he went on\\nliving 10\\n\\nWhen Levin thought what he was and what he was living for, he could\\nfind no answer to the questions and was reduced to despair, but he left\\noff questioning himself about it. It seemed as though he knew both what\\nhe was and for what he was living, for he acted and lived resolutely\\nand without hesitation. Indeed, in these latter days he was far more\\ndecided and unhesitating in life than he had ever been.\\n\\nWhen he went back to the country at the beginning of June, he went back\\nalso to his usual pursuits. The management of the estate, his relations\\nwith the peasants and the neighbors, the care of his household, the\\nmanagement of his sister’s and brother’s property, of which he had the\\ndirection, his relations with his wife and kindred, the care of his\\nchild, and the new bee-keeping hobby he had taken up that spring,\\nfilled all his time.\\n\\nThese things occupied him now, not because he justified them to himself\\nby any sort of general principles, as he had done in former days; on\\nthe contrary, disappointed by the failure of his former efforts for the\\ngeneral welfare, and too much occupied with his own thought and the\\nmass of business with which he was burdened from all sides, he had\\ncompletely given up thinking of the general good, and he busied himself\\nwith all this work simply because it seemed to him that he must do what\\nhe was doing—that he could not do otherwise. In former days—almost from\\nchildhood, and increasingly up to full manhood—when he had tried to do\\nanything that would be good for all, for humanity, for Russia, for the\\nwhole village, he had noticed that the idea of it had been pleasant,\\nbut the work itself had always been incoherent, that then he had never\\nhad a full conviction of its absolute necessity, and that the work that\\nhad begun by seeming so great, had grown less and less, till it\\nvanished into nothing. But now, since his marriage, when he had begun\\nto confine himself more and more to living for himself, though he\\nexperienced no delight at all at the thought of the work he was doing,\\nhe felt a complete conviction of its necessity, saw that it succeeded\\nfar better than in old days, and that it kept on growing more and more.\\n\\nNow, involuntarily it seemed, he cut more and more deeply into the soil\\nlike a plough, so that he could not be drawn out without turning aside\\nthe furrow.\\n\\nTo live the same family life as his father and forefathers—that is, in\\nthe same condition of culture—and to bring up his children in the same,\\nwas incontestably necessary. It was as necessary as dining when one was\\nhungry. And to do this, just as it was necessary to cook dinner, it was\\nnecessary to keep the mechanism of agriculture at Pokrovskoe going so\\nas to yield an income. Just as incontestably as it was necessary to\\nrepay a debt was it necessary to keep the property in such a condition\\nthat his son, when he received it as a heritage, would say “thank you”\\nto his father as Levin had said “thank you” to his grandfather for all\\nhe built and planted. And to do this it was necessary to look after the\\nland himself, not to let it, and to breed cattle, manure the fields,\\nand plant timber.\\n\\nIt was impossible not to look after the affairs of Sergey Ivanovitch,\\nof his sister, of the peasants who came to him for advice and were\\naccustomed to do so—as impossible as to fling down a child one is\\ncarrying in one’s arms. It was necessary to look after the comfort of\\nhis sister-in-law and her children, and of his wife and baby, and it\\nwas impossible not to spend with them at least a short time each day.\\n\\nAnd all this, together with shooting and his new bee-keeping, filled up\\nthe whole of Levin’s life, which had no meaning at all for him, when he\\nbegan to think.\\n\\nBut besides knowing thoroughly what he had to do, Levin knew in just\\nthe same way _how_ he had to do it all, and what was more important\\nthan the rest.\\n\\nHe knew he must hire laborers as cheaply as possible; but to hire men\\nunder bond, paying them in advance at less than the current rate of\\nwages, was what he must not do, even though it was very profitable.\\nSelling straw to the peasants in times of scarcity of provender was\\nwhat he might do, even though he felt sorry for them; but the tavern\\nand the pothouse must be put down, though they were a source of income.\\nFelling timber must be punished as severely as possible, but he could\\nnot exact forfeits for cattle being driven onto his fields; and though\\nit annoyed the keeper and made the peasants not afraid to graze their\\ncattle on his land, he could not keep their cattle as a punishment.\\n\\nTo Pyotr, who was paying a money-lender ten per cent. a month, he must\\nlend a sum of money to set him free. But he could not let off peasants\\nwho did not pay their rent, nor let them fall into arrears. It was\\nimpossible to overlook the bailiff’s not having mown the meadows and\\nletting the hay spoil; and it was equally impossible to mow those acres\\nwhere a young copse had been planted. It was impossible to excuse a\\nlaborer who had gone home in the busy season because his father was\\ndying, however sorry he might feel for him, and he must subtract from\\nhis pay those costly months of idleness. But it was impossible not to\\nallow monthly rations to the old servants who were of no use for\\nanything.\\n\\nLevin knew that when he got home he must first of all go to his wife,\\nwho was unwell, and that the peasants who had been waiting for three\\nhours to see him could wait a little longer. He knew too that,\\nregardless of all the pleasure he felt in taking a swarm, he must\\nforego that pleasure, and leave the old man to see to the bees alone,\\nwhile he talked to the peasants who had come after him to the\\nbee-house.\\n\\nWhether he were acting rightly or wrongly he did not know, and far from\\ntrying to prove that he was, nowadays he avoided all thought or talk\\nabout it.\\n\\nReasoning had brought him to doubt, and prevented him from seeing what\\nhe ought to do and what he ought not. When he did not think, but simply\\nlived, he was continually aware of the presence of an infallible judge\\nin his soul, determining which of two possible courses of action was\\nthe better and which was the worse, and as soon as he did not act\\nrightly, he was at once aware of it.\\n\\nSo he lived, not knowing and not seeing any chance of knowing what he\\nwas and what he was living for, and harassed at this lack of knowledge\\nto such a point that he was afraid of suicide, and yet firmly laying\\ndown his own individual definite path in life 11\\n\\nThe day on which Sergey Ivanovitch came to Pokrovskoe was one of\\nLevin’s most painful days. It was the very busiest working time, when\\nall the peasantry show an extraordinary intensity of self-sacrifice in\\nlabor, such as is never shown in any other conditions of life, and\\nwould be highly esteemed if the men who showed these qualities\\nthemselves thought highly of them, and if it were not repeated every\\nyear, and if the results of this intense labor were not so simple.\\n\\nTo reap and bind the rye and oats and to carry it, to mow the meadows,\\nturn over the fallows, thrash the seed and sow the winter corn—all this\\nseems so simple and ordinary; but to succeed in getting through it all\\neveryone in the village, from the old man to the young child, must toil\\nincessantly for three or four weeks, three times as hard as usual,\\nliving on rye-beer, onions, and black bread, thrashing and carrying the\\nsheaves at night, and not giving more than two or three hours in the\\ntwenty-four to sleep. And every year this is done all over Russia.\\n\\nHaving lived the greater part of his life in the country and in the\\nclosest relations with the peasants, Levin always felt in this busy\\ntime that he was infected by this general quickening of energy in the\\npeople.\\n\\nIn the early morning he rode over to the first sowing of the rye, and\\nto the oats, which were being carried to the stacks, and returning home\\nat the time his wife and sister-in-law were getting up, he drank coffee\\nwith them and walked to the farm, where a new thrashing machine was to\\nbe set working to get ready the seed-corn.\\n\\nHe was standing in the cool granary, still fragrant with the leaves of\\nthe hazel branches interlaced on the freshly peeled aspen beams of the\\nnew thatch roof. He gazed through the open door in which the dry bitter\\ndust of the thrashing whirled and played, at the grass of the thrashing\\nfloor in the sunlight and the fresh straw that had been brought in from\\nthe barn, then at the speckly-headed, white-breasted swallows that flew\\nchirping in under the roof and, fluttering their wings, settled in the\\ncrevices of the doorway, then at the peasants bustling in the dark,\\ndusty barn, and he thought strange thoughts.\\n\\n“Why is it all being done?” he thought. “Why am I standing here, making\\nthem work? What are they all so busy for, trying to show their zeal\\nbefore me? What is that old Matrona, my old friend, toiling for? (I\\ndoctored her, when the beam fell on her in the fire)” he thought,\\nlooking at a thin old woman who was raking up the grain, moving\\npainfully with her bare, sun-blackened feet over the uneven, rough\\nfloor. “Then she recovered, but today or tomorrow or in ten years she\\nwon’t; they’ll bury her, and nothing will be left either of her or of\\nthat smart girl in the red jacket, who with that skillful, soft action\\nshakes the ears out of their husks. They’ll bury her and this piebald\\nhorse, and very soon too,” he thought, gazing at the heavily moving,\\npanting horse that kept walking up the wheel that turned under him.\\n“And they will bury her and Fyodor the thrasher with his curly beard\\nfull of chaff and his shirt torn on his white shoulders—they will bury\\nhim. He’s untying the sheaves, and giving orders, and shouting to the\\nwomen, and quickly setting straight the strap on the moving wheel. And\\nwhat’s more, it’s not them alone—me they’ll bury too, and nothing will\\nbe left. What for?”\\n\\nHe thought this, and at the same time looked at his watch to reckon how\\nmuch they thrashed in an hour. He wanted to know this so as to judge by\\nit the task to set for the day.\\n\\n“It’ll soon be one, and they’re only beginning the third sheaf,”\\nthought Levin. He went up to the man that was feeding the machine, and\\nshouting over the roar of the machine he told him to put it in more\\nslowly. “You put in too much at a time, Fyodor. Do you see—it gets\\nchoked, that’s why it isn’t getting on. Do it evenly.”\\n\\nFyodor, black with the dust that clung to his moist face, shouted\\nsomething in response, but still went on doing it as Levin did not want\\nhim to.\\n\\nLevin, going up to the machine, moved Fyodor aside, and began feeding\\nthe corn in himself. Working on till the peasants’ dinner hour, which\\nwas not long in coming, he went out of the barn with Fyodor and fell\\ninto talk with him, stopping beside a neat yellow sheaf of rye laid on\\nthe thrashing floor for seed.\\n\\nFyodor came from a village at some distance from the one in which Levin\\nhad once allotted land to his cooperative association. Now it had been\\nlet to a former house porter.\\n\\nLevin talked to Fyodor about this land and asked whether Platon, a\\nwell-to-do peasant of good character belonging to the same village,\\nwould not take the land for the coming year.\\n\\n“It’s a high rent; it wouldn’t pay Platon, Konstantin Dmitrievitch,”\\nanswered the peasant, picking the ears off his sweat-drenched shirt.\\n\\n“But how does Kirillov make it pay?”\\n\\n“Mituh!” (so the peasant called the house porter, in a tone of\\ncontempt), “you may be sure he’ll make it pay, Konstantin Dmitrievitch!\\nHe’ll get his share, however he has to squeeze to get it! He’s no mercy\\non a Christian. But Uncle Fokanitch” (so he called the old peasant\\nPlaton), “do you suppose he’d flay the skin off a man? Where there’s\\ndebt, he’ll let anyone off. And he’ll not wring the last penny out.\\nHe’s a man too.”\\n\\n“But why will he let anyone off?”\\n\\n“Oh, well, of course, folks are different. One man lives for his own\\nwants and nothing else, like Mituh, he only thinks of filling his\\nbelly, but Fokanitch is a righteous man. He lives for his soul. He does\\nnot forget God.”\\n\\n“How thinks of God? How does he live for his soul?” Levin almost\\nshouted.\\n\\n“Why, to be sure, in truth, in God’s way. Folks are different. Take you\\nnow, you wouldn’t wrong a man....”\\n\\n“Yes, yes, good-bye!” said Levin, breathless with excitement, and\\nturning round he took his stick and walked quickly away towards home.\\nAt the peasant’s words that Fokanitch lived for his soul, in truth, in\\nGod’s way, undefined but significant ideas seemed to burst out as\\nthough they had been locked up, and all striving towards one goal, they\\nthronged whirling through his head, blinding him with their light 12\\n\\nLevin strode along the highroad, absorbed not so much in his thoughts\\n(he could not yet disentangle them) as in his spiritual condition,\\nunlike anything he had experienced before.\\n\\nThe words uttered by the peasant had acted on his soul like an electric\\nshock, suddenly transforming and combining into a single whole the\\nwhole swarm of disjointed, impotent, separate thoughts that incessantly\\noccupied his mind. These thoughts had unconsciously been in his mind\\neven when he was talking about the land.\\n\\nHe was aware of something new in his soul, and joyfully tested this new\\nthing, not yet knowing what it was.\\n\\n“Not living for his own wants, but for God? For what God? And could one\\nsay anything more senseless than what he said? He said that one must\\nnot live for one’s own wants, that is, that one must not live for what\\nwe understand, what we are attracted by, what we desire, but must live\\nfor something incomprehensible, for God, whom no one can understand nor\\neven define. What of it? Didn’t I understand those senseless words of\\nFyodor’s? And understanding them, did I doubt of their truth? Did I\\nthink them stupid, obscure, inexact? No, I understood him, and exactly\\nas he understands the words. I understood them more fully and clearly\\nthan I understand anything in life, and never in my life have I doubted\\nnor can I doubt about it. And not only I, but everyone, the whole world\\nunderstands nothing fully but this, and about this only they have no\\ndoubt and are always agreed.\\n\\n“And I looked out for miracles, complained that I did not see a miracle\\nwhich would convince me. A material miracle would have persuaded me.\\nAnd here is a miracle, the sole miracle possible, continually existing,\\nsurrounding me on all sides, and I never noticed it!\\n\\n“Fyodor says that Kirillov lives for his belly. That’s comprehensible\\nand rational. All of us as rational beings can’t do anything else but\\nlive for our belly. And all of a sudden the same Fyodor says that one\\nmustn’t live for one’s belly, but must live for truth, for God, and at\\na hint I understand him! And I and millions of men, men who lived ages\\nago and men living now—peasants, the poor in spirit and the learned,\\nwho have thought and written about it, in their obscure words saying\\nthe same thing—we are all agreed about this one thing: what we must\\nlive for and what is good. I and all men have only one firm,\\nincontestable, clear knowledge, and that knowledge cannot be explained\\nby the reason—it is outside it, and has no causes and can have no\\neffects.\\n\\n“If goodness has causes, it is not goodness; if it has effects, a\\nreward, it is not goodness either. So goodness is outside the chain of\\ncause and effect.\\n\\n“And yet I know it, and we all know it.\\n\\n“What could be a greater miracle than that?\\n\\n“Can I have found the solution of it all? can my sufferings be over?”\\nthought Levin, striding along the dusty road, not noticing the heat nor\\nhis weariness, and experiencing a sense of relief from prolonged\\nsuffering. This feeling was so delicious that it seemed to him\\nincredible. He was breathless with emotion and incapable of going\\nfarther; he turned off the road into the forest and lay down in the\\nshade of an aspen on the uncut grass. He took his hat off his hot head\\nand lay propped on his elbow in the lush, feathery, woodland grass.\\n\\n“Yes, I must make it clear to myself and understand,” he thought,\\nlooking intently at the untrampled grass before him, and following the\\nmovements of a green beetle, advancing along a blade of couch-grass and\\nlifting up in its progress a leaf of goat-weed. “What have I\\ndiscovered?” he asked himself, bending aside the leaf of goat-weed out\\nof the beetle’s way and twisting another blade of grass above for the\\nbeetle to cross over onto it. “What is it makes me glad? What have I\\ndiscovered?\\n\\n“I have discovered nothing. I have only found out what I knew. I\\nunderstand the force that in the past gave me life, and now too gives\\nme life. I have been set free from falsity, I have found the Master.\\n\\n“Of old I used to say that in my body, that in the body of this grass\\nand of this beetle (there, she didn’t care for the grass, she’s opened\\nher wings and flown away), there was going on a transformation of\\nmatter in accordance with physical, chemical, and physiological laws.\\nAnd in all of us, as well as in the aspens and the clouds and the misty\\npatches, there was a process of evolution. Evolution from what? into\\nwhat?—Eternal evolution and struggle.... As though there could be any\\nsort of tendency and struggle in the eternal! And I was astonished that\\nin spite of the utmost effort of thought along that road I could not\\ndiscover the meaning of life, the meaning of my impulses and yearnings.\\nNow I say that I know the meaning of my life: ‘To live for God, for my\\nsoul.’ And this meaning, in spite of its clearness, is mysterious and\\nmarvelous. Such, indeed, is the meaning of everything existing. Yes,\\npride,” he said to himself, turning over on his stomach and beginning\\nto tie a noose of blades of grass, trying not to break them.\\n\\n“And not merely pride of intellect, but dulness of intellect. And most\\nof all, the deceitfulness; yes, the deceitfulness of intellect. The\\ncheating knavishness of intellect, that’s it,” he said to himself.\\n\\nAnd he briefly went through, mentally, the whole course of his ideas\\nduring the last two years, the beginning of which was the clear\\nconfronting of death at the sight of his dear brother hopelessly ill.\\n\\nThen, for the first time, grasping that for every man, and himself too,\\nthere was nothing in store but suffering, death, and forgetfulness, he\\nhad made up his mind that life was impossible like that, and that he\\nmust either interpret life so that it would not present itself to him\\nas the evil jest of some devil, or shoot himself.\\n\\nBut he had not done either, but had gone on living, thinking, and\\nfeeling, and had even at that very time married, and had had many joys\\nand had been happy, when he was not thinking of the meaning of his\\nlife.\\n\\nWhat did this mean? It meant that he had been living rightly, but\\nthinking wrongly.\\n\\nHe had lived (without being aware of it) on those spiritual truths that\\nhe had sucked in with his mother’s milk, but he had thought, not merely\\nwithout recognition of these truths, but studiously ignoring them.\\n\\nNow it was clear to him that he could only live by virtue of the\\nbeliefs in which he had been brought up.\\n\\n“What should I have been, and how should I have spent my life, if I had\\nnot had these beliefs, if I had not known that I must live for God and\\nnot for my own desires? I should have robbed and lied and killed.\\nNothing of what makes the chief happiness of my life would have existed\\nfor me.” And with the utmost stretch of imagination he could not\\nconceive the brutal creature he would have been himself, if he had not\\nknown what he was living for.\\n\\n“I looked for an answer to my question. And thought could not give an\\nanswer to my question—it is incommensurable with my question. The\\nanswer has been given me by life itself, in my knowledge of what is\\nright and what is wrong. And that knowledge I did not arrive at in any\\nway, it was given to me as to all men, _given_, because I could not\\nhave got it from anywhere.\\n\\n“Where could I have got it? By reason could I have arrived at knowing\\nthat I must love my neighbor and not oppress him? I was told that in my\\nchildhood, and I believed it gladly, for they told me what was already\\nin my soul. But who discovered it? Not reason. Reason discovered the\\nstruggle for existence, and the law that requires us to oppress all who\\nhinder the satisfaction of our desires. That is the deduction of\\nreason. But loving one’s neighbor reason could never discover, because\\nit’s irrational 13\\n\\nAnd Levin remembered a scene he had lately witnessed between Dolly and\\nher children. The children, left to themselves, had begun cooking\\nraspberries over the candles and squirting milk into each other’s\\nmouths with a syringe. Their mother, catching them at these pranks,\\nbegan reminding them in Levin’s presence of the trouble their mischief\\ngave to the grown-up people, and that this trouble was all for their\\nsake, and that if they smashed the cups they would have nothing to\\ndrink their tea out of, and that if they wasted the milk, they would\\nhave nothing to eat, and die of hunger.\\n\\nAnd Levin had been struck by the passive, weary incredulity with which\\nthe children heard what their mother said to them. They were simply\\nannoyed that their amusing play had been interrupted, and did not\\nbelieve a word of what their mother was saying. They could not believe\\nit indeed, for they could not take in the immensity of all they\\nhabitually enjoyed, and so could not conceive that what they were\\ndestroying was the very thing they lived by.\\n\\n“That all comes of itself,” they thought, “and there’s nothing\\ninteresting or important about it because it has always been so, and\\nalways will be so. And it’s all always the same. We’ve no need to think\\nabout that, it’s all ready. But we want to invent something of our own,\\nand new. So we thought of putting raspberries in a cup, and cooking\\nthem over a candle, and squirting milk straight into each other’s\\nmouths. That’s fun, and something new, and not a bit worse than\\ndrinking out of cups.”\\n\\n“Isn’t it just the same that we do, that I did, searching by the aid of\\nreason for the significance of the forces of nature and the meaning of\\nthe life of man?” he thought.\\n\\n“And don’t all the theories of philosophy do the same, trying by the\\npath of thought, which is strange and not natural to man, to bring him\\nto a knowledge of what he has known long ago, and knows so certainly\\nthat he could not live at all without it? Isn’t it distinctly to be\\nseen in the development of each philosopher’s theory, that he knows\\nwhat is the chief significance of life beforehand, just as positively\\nas the peasant Fyodor, and not a bit more clearly than he, and is\\nsimply trying by a dubious intellectual path to come back to what\\neveryone knows?\\n\\n“Now then, leave the children to themselves to get things alone and\\nmake their crockery, get the milk from the cows, and so on. Would they\\nbe naughty then? Why, they’d die of hunger! Well, then, leave us with\\nour passions and thoughts, without any idea of the one God, of the\\nCreator, or without any idea of what is right, without any idea of\\nmoral evil.\\n\\n“Just try and build up anything without those ideas!\\n\\n“We only try to destroy them, because we’re spiritually provided for.\\nExactly like the children!\\n\\n“Whence have I that joyful knowledge, shared with the peasant, that\\nalone gives peace to my soul? Whence did I get it?\\n\\n“Brought up with an idea of God, a Christian, my whole life filled with\\nthe spiritual blessings Christianity has given me, full of them, and\\nliving on those blessings, like the children I did not understand them,\\nand destroy, that is try to destroy, what I live by. And as soon as an\\nimportant moment of life comes, like the children when they are cold\\nand hungry, I turn to Him, and even less than the children when their\\nmother scolds them for their childish mischief, do I feel that my\\nchildish efforts at wanton madness are reckoned against me.\\n\\n“Yes, what I know, I know not by reason, but it has been given to me,\\nrevealed to me, and I know it with my heart, by faith in the chief\\nthing taught by the church.\\n\\n“The church! the church!” Levin repeated to himself. He turned over on\\nthe other side, and leaning on his elbow, fell to gazing into the\\ndistance at a herd of cattle crossing over to the river.\\n\\n“But can I believe in all the church teaches?” he thought, trying\\nhimself, and thinking of everything that could destroy his present\\npeace of mind. Intentionally he recalled all those doctrines of the\\nchurch which had always seemed most strange and had always been a\\nstumbling block to him.\\n\\n“The Creation? But how did I explain existence? By existence? By\\nnothing? The devil and sin. But how do I explain evil?... The\\natonement?...\\n\\n“But I know nothing, nothing, and I can know nothing but what has been\\ntold to me and all men.”\\n\\nAnd it seemed to him that there was not a single article of faith of\\nthe church which could destroy the chief thing—faith in God, in\\ngoodness, as the one goal of man’s destiny.\\n\\nUnder every article of faith of the church could be put the faith in\\nthe service of truth instead of one’s desires. And each doctrine did\\nnot simply leave that faith unshaken, each doctrine seemed essential to\\ncomplete that great miracle, continually manifest upon earth, that made\\nit possible for each man and millions of different sorts of men, wise\\nmen and imbeciles, old men and children—all men, peasants, Lvov, Kitty,\\nbeggars and kings to understand perfectly the same one thing, and to\\nbuild up thereby that life of the soul which alone is worth living, and\\nwhich alone is precious to us.\\n\\nLying on his back, he gazed up now into the high, cloudless sky. “Do I\\nnot know that that is infinite space, and that it is not a round arch?\\nBut, however I screw up my eyes and strain my sight, I cannot see it\\nnot round and not bounded, and in spite of my knowing about infinite\\nspace, I am incontestably right when I see a solid blue dome, and more\\nright than when I strain my eyes to see beyond it.”\\n\\nLevin ceased thinking, and only, as it were, listened to mysterious\\nvoices that seemed talking joyfully and earnestly within him.\\n\\n“Can this be faith?” he thought, afraid to believe in his happiness.\\n“My God, I thank Thee!” he said, gulping down his sobs, and with both\\nhands brushing away the tears that filled his eyes 14\\n\\nLevin looked before him and saw a herd of cattle, then he caught sight\\nof his trap with Raven in the shafts, and the coachman, who, driving up\\nto the herd, said something to the herdsman. Then he heard the rattle\\nof the wheels and the snort of the sleek horse close by him. But he was\\nso buried in his thoughts that he did not even wonder why the coachman\\nhad come for him.\\n\\nHe only thought of that when the coachman had driven quite up to him\\nand shouted to him. “The mistress sent me. Your brother has come, and\\nsome gentleman with him.”\\n\\nLevin got into the trap and took the reins. As though just roused out\\nof sleep, for a long while Levin could not collect his faculties. He\\nstared at the sleek horse flecked with lather between his haunches and\\non his neck, where the harness rubbed, stared at Ivan the coachman\\nsitting beside him, and remembered that he was expecting his brother,\\nthought that his wife was most likely uneasy at his long absence, and\\ntried to guess who was the visitor who had come with his brother. And\\nhis brother and his wife and the unknown guest seemed to him now quite\\ndifferent from before. He fancied that now his relations with all men\\nwould be different.\\n\\n“With my brother there will be none of that aloofness there always used\\nto be between us, there will be no disputes; with Kitty there shall\\nnever be quarrels; with the visitor, whoever he may be, I will be\\nfriendly and nice; with the servants, with Ivan, it will all be\\ndifferent.”\\n\\nPulling the stiff rein and holding in the good horse that snorted with\\nimpatience and seemed begging to be let go, Levin looked round at Ivan\\nsitting beside him, not knowing what to do with his unoccupied hand,\\ncontinually pressing down his shirt as it puffed out, and he tried to\\nfind something to start a conversation about with him. He would have\\nsaid that Ivan had pulled the saddle-girth up too high, but that was\\nlike blame, and he longed for friendly, warm talk. Nothing else\\noccurred to him.\\n\\n“Your honor must keep to the right and mind that stump,” said the\\ncoachman, pulling the rein Levin held.\\n\\n“Please don’t touch and don’t teach me!” said Levin, angered by this\\ninterference. Now, as always, interference made him angry, and he felt\\nsorrowfully at once how mistaken had been his supposition that his\\nspiritual condition could immediately change him in contact with\\nreality.\\n\\nHe was not a quarter of a mile from home when he saw Grisha and Tanya\\nrunning to meet him.\\n\\n“Uncle Kostya! mamma’s coming, and grandfather, and Sergey Ivanovitch,\\nand someone else,” they said, clambering up into the trap.\\n\\n“Who is he?”\\n\\n“An awfully terrible person! And he does like this with his arms,” said\\nTanya, getting up in the trap and mimicking Katavasov.\\n\\n“Old or young?” asked Levin, laughing, reminded of someone, he did not\\nknow whom, by Tanya’s performance.\\n\\n“Oh, I hope it’s not a tiresome person!” thought Levin.\\n\\nAs soon as he turned, at a bend in the road, and saw the party coming,\\nLevin recognized Katavasov in a straw hat, walking along swinging his\\narms just as Tanya had shown him. Katavasov was very fond of discussing\\nmetaphysics, having derived his notions from natural science writers\\nwho had never studied metaphysics, and in Moscow Levin had had many\\narguments with him of late.\\n\\nAnd one of these arguments, in which Katavasov had obviously considered\\nthat he came off victorious, was the first thing Levin thought of as he\\nrecognized him.\\n\\n“No, whatever I do, I won’t argue and give utterance to my ideas\\nlightly,” he thought.\\n\\nGetting out of the trap and greeting his brother and Katavasov, Levin\\nasked about his wife.\\n\\n“She has taken Mitya to Kolok” (a copse near the house). “She meant to\\nhave him out there because it’s so hot indoors,” said Dolly. Levin had\\nalways advised his wife not to take the baby to the wood, thinking it\\nunsafe, and he was not pleased to hear this.\\n\\n“She rushes about from place to place with him,” said the prince,\\nsmiling. “I advised her to try putting him in the ice cellar.”\\n\\n“She meant to come to the bee-house. She thought you would be there. We\\nare going there,” said Dolly.\\n\\n“Well, and what are you doing?” said Sergey Ivanovitch, falling back\\nfrom the rest and walking beside him.\\n\\n“Oh, nothing special. Busy as usual with the land,” answered Levin.\\n“Well, and what about you? Come for long? We have been expecting you\\nfor such a long time.”\\n\\n“Only for a fortnight. I’ve a great deal to do in Moscow.”\\n\\nAt these words the brothers’ eyes met, and Levin, in spite of the\\ndesire he always had, stronger than ever just now, to be on\\naffectionate and still more open terms with his brother, felt an\\nawkwardness in looking at him. He dropped his eyes and did not know\\nwhat to say.\\n\\nCasting over the subjects of conversation that would be pleasant to\\nSergey Ivanovitch, and would keep him off the subject of the Servian\\nwar and the Slavonic question, at which he had hinted by the allusion\\nto what he had to do in Moscow, Levin began to talk of Sergey\\nIvanovitch’s book.\\n\\n“Well, have there been reviews of your book?” he asked.\\n\\nSergey Ivanovitch smiled at the intentional character of the question.\\n\\n“No one is interested in that now, and I less than anyone,” he said.\\n“Just look, Darya Alexandrovna, we shall have a shower,” he added,\\npointing with a sunshade at the white rain clouds that showed above the\\naspen tree-tops.\\n\\nAnd these words were enough to re-establish again between the brothers\\nthat tone—hardly hostile, but chilly—which Levin had been so longing to\\navoid.\\n\\nLevin went up to Katavasov.\\n\\n“It was jolly of you to make up your mind to come,” he said to him.\\n\\n“I’ve been meaning to a long while. Now we shall have some discussion,\\nwe’ll see to that. Have you been reading Spencer?”\\n\\n“No, I’ve not finished reading him,” said Levin. “But I don’t need him\\nnow.”\\n\\n“How’s that? that’s interesting. Why so?”\\n\\n“I mean that I’m fully convinced that the solution of the problems that\\ninterest me I shall never find in him and his like. Now....”\\n\\nBut Katavasov’s serene and good-humored expression suddenly struck him,\\nand he felt such tenderness for his own happy mood, which he was\\nunmistakably disturbing by this conversation, that he remembered his\\nresolution and stopped short.\\n\\n“But we’ll talk later on,” he added. “If we’re going to the bee-house,\\nit’s this way, along this little path,” he said, addressing them all.\\n\\nGoing along the narrow path to a little uncut meadow covered on one\\nside with thick clumps of brilliant heart’s-ease among which stood up\\nhere and there tall, dark green tufts of hellebore, Levin settled his\\nguests in the dense, cool shade of the young aspens on a bench and some\\nstumps purposely put there for visitors to the bee-house who might be\\nafraid of the bees, and he went off himself to the hut to get bread,\\ncucumbers, and fresh honey, to regale them with.\\n\\nTrying to make his movements as deliberate as possible, and listening\\nto the bees that buzzed more and more frequently past him, he walked\\nalong the little path to the hut. In the very entry one bee hummed\\nangrily, caught in his beard, but he carefully extricated it. Going\\ninto the shady outer room, he took down from the wall his veil, that\\nhung on a peg, and putting it on, and thrusting his hands into his\\npockets, he went into the fenced-in bee-garden, where there stood in\\nthe midst of a closely mown space in regular rows, fastened with bast\\non posts, all the hives he knew so well, the old stocks, each with its\\nown history, and along the fences the younger swarms hived that year.\\nIn front of the openings of the hives, it made his eyes giddy to watch\\nthe bees and drones whirling round and round about the same spot, while\\namong them the working bees flew in and out with spoils or in search of\\nthem, always in the same direction into the wood to the flowering lime\\ntrees and back to the hives.\\n\\nHis ears were filled with the incessant hum in various notes, now the\\nbusy hum of the working bee flying quickly off, then the blaring of the\\nlazy drone, and the excited buzz of the bees on guard protecting their\\nproperty from the enemy and preparing to sting. On the farther side of\\nthe fence the old bee-keeper was shaving a hoop for a tub, and he did\\nnot see Levin. Levin stood still in the midst of the beehives and did\\nnot call him.\\n\\nHe was glad of a chance to be alone to recover from the influence of\\nordinary actual life, which had already depressed his happy mood. He\\nthought that he had already had time to lose his temper with Ivan, to\\nshow coolness to his brother, and to talk flippantly with Katavasov.\\n\\n“Can it have been only a momentary mood, and will it pass and leave no\\ntrace?” he thought. But the same instant, going back to his mood, he\\nfelt with delight that something new and important had happened to him.\\nReal life had only for a time overcast the spiritual peace he had\\nfound, but it was still untouched within him.\\n\\nJust as the bees, whirling round him, now menacing him and distracting\\nhis attention, prevented him from enjoying complete physical peace,\\nforced him to restrain his movements to avoid them, so had the petty\\ncares that had swarmed about him from the moment he got into the trap\\nrestricted his spiritual freedom; but that lasted only so long as he\\nwas among them. Just as his bodily strength was still unaffected, in\\nspite of the bees, so too was the spiritual strength that he had just\\nbecome aware of 15\\n\\n“Do you know, Kostya, with whom Sergey Ivanovitch traveled on his way\\nhere?” said Dolly, doling out cucumbers and honey to the children;\\n“with Vronsky! He’s going to Servia.”\\n\\n“And not alone; he’s taking a squadron out with him at his own\\nexpense,” said Katavasov.\\n\\n“That’s the right thing for him,” said Levin. “Are volunteers still\\ngoing out then?” he added, glancing at Sergey Ivanovitch.\\n\\nSergey Ivanovitch did not answer. He was carefully with a blunt knife\\ngetting a live bee covered with sticky honey out of a cup full of white\\nhoneycomb.\\n\\n“I should think so! You should have seen what was going on at the\\nstation yesterday!” said Katavasov, biting with a juicy sound into a\\ncucumber.\\n\\n“Well, what is one to make of it? For mercy’s sake, do explain to me,\\nSergey Ivanovitch, where are all those volunteers going, whom are they\\nfighting with?” asked the old prince, unmistakably taking up a\\nconversation that had sprung up in Levin’s absence.\\n\\n“With the Turks,” Sergey Ivanovitch answered, smiling serenely, as he\\nextricated the bee, dark with honey and helplessly kicking, and put it\\nwith the knife on a stout aspen leaf.\\n\\n“But who has declared war on the Turks?—Ivan Ivanovitch Ragozov and\\nCountess Lidia Ivanovna, assisted by Madame Stahl?”\\n\\n“No one has declared war, but people sympathize with their neighbors’\\nsufferings and are eager to help them,” said Sergey Ivanovitch.\\n\\n“But the prince is not speaking of help,” said Levin, coming to the\\nassistance of his father-in-law, “but of war. The prince says that\\nprivate persons cannot take part in war without the permission of the\\ngovernment.”\\n\\n“Kostya, mind, that’s a bee! Really, they’ll sting us!” said Dolly,\\nwaving away a wasp.\\n\\n“But that’s not a bee, it’s a wasp,” said Levin.\\n\\n“Well now, well, what’s your own theory?” Katavasov said to Levin with\\na smile, distinctly challenging him to a discussion. “Why have not\\nprivate persons the right to do so?”\\n\\n“Oh, my theory’s this: war is on one side such a beastly, cruel, and\\nawful thing, that no one man, not to speak of a Christian, can\\nindividually take upon himself the responsibility of beginning wars;\\nthat can only be done by a government, which is called upon to do this,\\nand is driven inevitably into war. On the other hand, both political\\nscience and common sense teach us that in matters of state, and\\nespecially in the matter of war, private citizens must forego their\\npersonal individual will.”\\n\\nSergey Ivanovitch and Katavasov had their replies ready, and both began\\nspeaking at the same time.\\n\\n“But the point is, my dear fellow, that there may be cases when the\\ngovernment does not carry out the will of the citizens and then the\\npublic asserts its will,” said Katavasov.\\n\\nBut evidently Sergey Ivanovitch did not approve of this answer. His\\nbrows contracted at Katavasov’s words and he said something else.\\n\\n“You don’t put the matter in its true light. There is no question here\\nof a declaration of war, but simply the expression of a human Christian\\nfeeling. Our brothers, one with us in religion and in race, are being\\nmassacred. Even supposing they were not our brothers nor\\nfellow-Christians, but simply children, women, old people, feeling is\\naroused and Russians go eagerly to help in stopping these atrocities.\\nFancy, if you were going along the street and saw drunken men beating a\\nwoman or a child—I imagine you would not stop to inquire whether war\\nhad been declared on the men, but would throw yourself on them, and\\nprotect the victim.”\\n\\n“But I should not kill them,” said Levin.\\n\\n“Yes, you would kill them.”\\n\\n“I don’t know. If I saw that, I might give way to my impulse of the\\nmoment, but I can’t say beforehand. And such a momentary impulse there\\nis not, and there cannot be, in the case of the oppression of the\\nSlavonic peoples.”\\n\\n“Possibly for you there is not; but for others there is,” said Sergey\\nIvanovitch, frowning with displeasure. “There are traditions still\\nextant among the people of Slavs of the true faith suffering under the\\nyoke of the ‘unclean sons of Hagar.’ The people have heard of the\\nsufferings of their brethren and have spoken.”\\n\\n“Perhaps so,” said Levin evasively; “but I don’t see it. I’m one of the\\npeople myself, and I don’t feel it.”\\n\\n“Here am I too,” said the old prince. “I’ve been staying abroad and\\nreading the papers, and I must own, up to the time of the Bulgarian\\natrocities, I couldn’t make out why it was all the Russians were all of\\na sudden so fond of their Slavonic brethren, while I didn’t feel the\\nslightest affection for them. I was very much upset, thought I was a\\nmonster, or that it was the influence of Carlsbad on me. But since I\\nhave been here, my mind’s been set at rest. I see that there are people\\nbesides me who’re only interested in Russia, and not in their Slavonic\\nbrethren. Here’s Konstantin too.”\\n\\n“Personal opinions mean nothing in such a case,” said Sergey\\nIvanovitch; “it’s not a matter of personal opinions when all Russia—the\\nwhole people—has expressed its will.”\\n\\n“But excuse me, I don’t see that. The people don’t know anything about\\nit, if you come to that,” said the old prince.\\n\\n“Oh, papa!... how can you say that? And last Sunday in church?” said\\nDolly, listening to the conversation. “Please give me a cloth,” she\\nsaid to the old man, who was looking at the children with a smile.\\n“Why, it’s not possible that all....”\\n\\n“But what was it in church on Sunday? The priest had been told to read\\nthat. He read it. They didn’t understand a word of it. Then they were\\ntold that there was to be a collection for a pious object in church;\\nwell, they pulled out their halfpence and gave them, but what for they\\ncouldn’t say.”\\n\\n“The people cannot help knowing; the sense of their own destinies is\\nalways in the people, and at such moments as the present that sense\\nfinds utterance,” said Sergey Ivanovitch with conviction, glancing at\\nthe old bee-keeper.\\n\\nThe handsome old man, with black grizzled beard and thick silvery hair,\\nstood motionless, holding a cup of honey, looking down from the height\\nof his tall figure with friendly serenity at the gentlefolk, obviously\\nunderstanding nothing of their conversation and not caring to\\nunderstand it.\\n\\n“That’s so, no doubt,” he said, with a significant shake of his head at\\nSergey Ivanovitch’s words.\\n\\n“Here, then, ask him. He knows nothing about it and thinks nothing,”\\nsaid Levin. “Have you heard about the war, Mihalitch?” he said, turning\\nto him. “What they read in the church? What do you think about it?\\nOught we to fight for the Christians?”\\n\\n“What should we think? Alexander Nikolaevitch our Emperor has thought\\nfor us; he thinks for us indeed in all things. It’s clearer for him to\\nsee. Shall I bring a bit more bread? Give the little lad some more?” he\\nsaid addressing Darya Alexandrovna and pointing to Grisha, who had\\nfinished his crust.\\n\\n“I don’t need to ask,” said Sergey Ivanovitch, “we have seen and are\\nseeing hundreds and hundreds of people who give up everything to serve\\na just cause, come from every part of Russia, and directly and clearly\\nexpress their thought and aim. They bring their halfpence or go\\nthemselves and say directly what for. What does it mean?”\\n\\n“It means, to my thinking,” said Levin, who was beginning to get warm,\\n“that among eighty millions of people there can always be found not\\nhundreds, as now, but tens of thousands of people who have lost caste,\\nne’er-do-wells, who are always ready to go anywhere—to Pogatchev’s\\nbands, to Khiva, to Servia....”\\n\\n“I tell you that it’s not a case of hundreds or of ne’er-do-wells, but\\nthe best representatives of the people!” said Sergey Ivanovitch, with\\nas much irritation as if he were defending the last penny of his\\nfortune. “And what of the subscriptions? In this case it is a whole\\npeople directly expressing their will.”\\n\\n“That word ‘people’ is so vague,” said Levin. “Parish clerks, teachers,\\nand one in a thousand of the peasants, maybe, know what it’s all about.\\nThe rest of the eighty millions, like Mihalitch, far from expressing\\ntheir will, haven’t the faintest idea what there is for them to express\\ntheir will about. What right have we to say that this is the people’s\\nwill 16\\n\\nSergey Ivanovitch, being practiced in argument, did not reply, but at\\nonce turned the conversation to another aspect of the subject.\\n\\n“Oh, if you want to learn the spirit of the people by arithmetical\\ncomputation, of course it’s very difficult to arrive at it. And voting\\nhas not been introduced among us and cannot be introduced, for it does\\nnot express the will of the people; but there are other ways of\\nreaching that. It is felt in the air, it is felt by the heart. I won’t\\nspeak of those deep currents which are astir in the still ocean of the\\npeople, and which are evident to every unprejudiced man; let us look at\\nsociety in the narrow sense. All the most diverse sections of the\\neducated public, hostile before, are merged in one. Every division is\\nat an end, all the public organs say the same thing over and over\\nagain, all feel the mighty torrent that has overtaken them and is\\ncarrying them in one direction.”\\n\\n“Yes, all the newspapers do say the same thing,” said the prince.\\n“That’s true. But so it is the same thing that all the frogs croak\\nbefore a storm. One can hear nothing for them.”\\n\\n“Frogs or no frogs, I’m not the editor of a paper and I don’t want to\\ndefend them; but I am speaking of the unanimity in the intellectual\\nworld,” said Sergey Ivanovitch, addressing his brother. Levin would\\nhave answered, but the old prince interrupted him.\\n\\n“Well, about that unanimity, that’s another thing, one may say,” said\\nthe prince. “There’s my son-in-law, Stepan Arkadyevitch, you know him.\\nHe’s got a place now on the committee of a commission and something or\\nother, I don’t remember. Only there’s nothing to do in it—why, Dolly,\\nit’s no secret!—and a salary of eight thousand. You try asking him\\nwhether his post is of use, he’ll prove to you that it’s most\\nnecessary. And he’s a truthful man too, but there’s no refusing to\\nbelieve in the utility of eight thousand roubles.”\\n\\n“Yes, he asked me to give a message to Darya Alexandrovna about the\\npost,” said Sergey Ivanovitch reluctantly, feeling the prince’s remark\\nto be ill-timed.\\n\\n“So it is with the unanimity of the press. That’s been explained to me:\\nas soon as there’s war their incomes are doubled. How can they help\\nbelieving in the destinies of the people and the Slavonic races ... and\\nall that?”\\n\\n“I don’t care for many of the papers, but that’s unjust,” said Sergey\\nIvanovitch.\\n\\n“I would only make one condition,” pursued the old prince. “Alphonse\\nKarr said a capital thing before the war with Prussia: ‘You consider\\nwar to be inevitable? Very good. Let everyone who advocates war be\\nenrolled in a special regiment of advance-guards, for the front of\\nevery storm, of every attack, to lead them all!’”\\n\\n“A nice lot the editors would make!” said Katavasov, with a loud roar,\\nas he pictured the editors he knew in this picked legion.\\n\\n“But they’d run,” said Dolly, “they’d only be in the way.”\\n\\n“Oh, if they ran away, then we’d have grape-shot or Cossacks with whips\\nbehind them,” said the prince.\\n\\n“But that’s a joke, and a poor one too, if you’ll excuse my saying so,\\nprince,” said Sergey Ivanovitch.\\n\\n“I don’t see that it was a joke, that....” Levin was beginning, but\\nSergey Ivanovitch interrupted him.\\n\\n“Every member of society is called upon to do his own special work,”\\nsaid he. “And men of thought are doing their work when they express\\npublic opinion. And the single-hearted and full expression of public\\nopinion is the service of the press and a phenomenon to rejoice us at\\nthe same time. Twenty years ago we should have been silent, but now we\\nhave heard the voice of the Russian people, which is ready to rise as\\none man and ready to sacrifice itself for its oppressed brethren; that\\nis a great step and a proof of strength.”\\n\\n“But it’s not only making a sacrifice, but killing Turks,” said Levin\\ntimidly. “The people make sacrifices and are ready to make sacrifices\\nfor their soul, but not for murder,” he added, instinctively connecting\\nthe conversation with the ideas that had been absorbing his mind.\\n\\n“For their soul? That’s a most puzzling expression for a natural\\nscience man, do you understand? What sort of thing is the soul?” said\\nKatavasov, smiling.\\n\\n“Oh, you know!”\\n\\n“No, by God, I haven’t the faintest idea!” said Katavasov with a loud\\nroar of laughter.\\n\\n“‘I bring not peace, but a sword,’ says Christ,” Sergey Ivanovitch\\nrejoined for his part, quoting as simply as though it were the easiest\\nthing to understand the very passage that had always puzzled Levin\\nmost.\\n\\n“That’s so, no doubt,” the old man repeated again. He was standing near\\nthem and responded to a chance glance turned in his direction.\\n\\n“Ah, my dear fellow, you’re defeated, utterly defeated!” cried\\nKatavasov good-humoredly.\\n\\nLevin reddened with vexation, not at being defeated, but at having\\nfailed to control himself and being drawn into argument.\\n\\n“No, I can’t argue with them,” he thought; “they wear impenetrable\\narmor, while I’m naked.”\\n\\nHe saw that it was impossible to convince his brother and Katavasov,\\nand he saw even less possibility of himself agreeing with them. What\\nthey advocated was the very pride of intellect that had almost been his\\nruin. He could not admit that some dozens of men, among them his\\nbrother, had the right, on the ground of what they were told by some\\nhundreds of glib volunteers swarming to the capital, to say that they\\nand the newspapers were expressing the will and feeling of the people,\\nand a feeling which was expressed in vengeance and murder. He could not\\nadmit this, because he neither saw the expression of such feelings in\\nthe people among whom he was living, nor found them in himself (and he\\ncould not but consider himself one of the persons making up the Russian\\npeople), and most of all because he, like the people, did not know and\\ncould not know what is for the general good, though he knew beyond a\\ndoubt that this general good could be attained only by the strict\\nobservance of that law of right and wrong which has been revealed to\\nevery man, and therefore he could not wish for war or advocate war for\\nany general objects whatever. He said as Mihalitch did and the people,\\nwho had expressed their feeling in the traditional invitations of the\\nVaryagi: “Be princes and rule over us. Gladly we promise complete\\nsubmission. All the labor, all humiliations, all sacrifices we take\\nupon ourselves; but we will not judge and decide.” And now, according\\nto Sergey Ivanovitch’s account, the people had foregone this privilege\\nthey had bought at such a costly price.\\n\\nHe wanted to say too that if public opinion were an infallible guide,\\nthen why were not revolutions and the commune as lawful as the movement\\nin favor of the Slavonic peoples? But these were merely thoughts that\\ncould settle nothing. One thing could be seen beyond doubt—that was\\nthat at the actual moment the discussion was irritating Sergey\\nIvanovitch, and so it was wrong to continue it. And Levin ceased\\nspeaking and then called the attention of his guests to the fact that\\nthe storm clouds were gathering, and that they had better be going home\\nbefore it rained 17\\n\\nThe old prince and Sergey Ivanovitch got into the trap and drove off;\\nthe rest of the party hastened homewards on foot.\\n\\nBut the storm-clouds, turning white and then black, moved down so\\nquickly that they had to quicken their pace to get home before the\\nrain. The foremost clouds, lowering and black as soot-laden smoke,\\nrushed with extraordinary swiftness over the sky. They were still two\\nhundred paces from home and a gust of wind had already blown up, and\\nevery second the downpour might be looked for.\\n\\nThe children ran ahead with frightened and gleeful shrieks. Darya\\nAlexandrovna, struggling painfully with her skirts that clung round her\\nlegs, was not walking, but running, her eyes fixed on the children. The\\nmen of the party, holding their hats on, strode with long steps beside\\nher. They were just at the steps when a big drop fell splashing on the\\nedge of the iron guttering. The children and their elders after them\\nran into the shelter of the house, talking merrily.\\n\\n“Katerina Alexandrovna?” Levin asked of Agafea Mihalovna, who met them\\nwith kerchiefs and rugs in the hall.\\n\\n“We thought she was with you,” she said.\\n\\n“And Mitya?”\\n\\n“In the copse, he must be, and the nurse with him.”\\n\\nLevin snatched up the rugs and ran towards the copse.\\n\\nIn that brief interval of time the storm clouds had moved on, covering\\nthe sun so completely that it was dark as an eclipse. Stubbornly, as\\nthough insisting on its rights, the wind stopped Levin, and tearing the\\nleaves and flowers off the lime trees and stripping the white birch\\nbranches into strange unseemly nakedness, it twisted everything on one\\nside—acacias, flowers, burdocks, long grass, and tall tree-tops. The\\npeasant girls working in the garden ran shrieking into shelter in the\\nservants’ quarters. The streaming rain had already flung its white veil\\nover all the distant forest and half the fields close by, and was\\nrapidly swooping down upon the copse. The wet of the rain spurting up\\nin tiny drops could be smelt in the air.\\n\\nHolding his head bent down before him, and struggling with the wind\\nthat strove to tear the wraps away from him, Levin was moving up to the\\ncopse and had just caught sight of something white behind the oak tree,\\nwhen there was a sudden flash, the whole earth seemed on fire, and the\\nvault of heaven seemed crashing overhead. Opening his blinded eyes,\\nLevin gazed through the thick veil of rain that separated him now from\\nthe copse, and to his horror the first thing he saw was the green crest\\nof the familiar oak-tree in the middle of the copse uncannily changing\\nits position. “Can it have been struck?” Levin hardly had time to think\\nwhen, moving more and more rapidly, the oak tree vanished behind the\\nother trees, and he heard the crash of the great tree falling upon the\\nothers.\\n\\nThe flash of lightning, the crash of thunder, and the instantaneous\\nchill that ran through him were all merged for Levin in one sense of\\nterror.\\n\\n“My God! my God! not on them!” he said.\\n\\nAnd though he thought at once how senseless was his prayer that they\\nshould not have been killed by the oak which had fallen now, he\\nrepeated it, knowing that he could do nothing better than utter this\\nsenseless prayer.\\n\\nRunning up to the place where they usually went, he did not find them\\nthere.\\n\\nThey were at the other end of the copse under an old lime-tree; they\\nwere calling him. Two figures in dark dresses (they had been light\\nsummer dresses when they started out) were standing bending over\\nsomething. It was Kitty with the nurse. The rain was already ceasing,\\nand it was beginning to get light when Levin reached them. The nurse\\nwas not wet on the lower part of her dress, but Kitty was drenched\\nthrough, and her soaked clothes clung to her. Though the rain was over,\\nthey still stood in the same position in which they had been standing\\nwhen the storm broke. Both stood bending over a perambulator with a\\ngreen umbrella.\\n\\n“Alive? Unhurt? Thank God!” he said, splashing with his soaked boots\\nthrough the standing water and running up to them.\\n\\nKitty’s rosy wet face was turned towards him, and she smiled timidly\\nunder her shapeless sopped hat.\\n\\n“Aren’t you ashamed of yourself? I can’t think how you can be so\\nreckless!” he said angrily to his wife.\\n\\n“It wasn’t my fault, really. We were just meaning to go, when he made\\nsuch a to-do that we had to change him. We were just....” Kitty began\\ndefending herself.\\n\\nMitya was unharmed, dry, and still fast asleep.\\n\\n“Well, thank God! I don’t know what I’m saying!”\\n\\nThey gathered up the baby’s wet belongings; the nurse picked up the\\nbaby and carried it. Levin walked beside his wife, and, penitent for\\nhaving been angry, he squeezed her hand when the nurse was not looking 18\\n\\nDuring the whole of that day, in the extremely different conversations\\nin which he took part, only as it were with the top layer of his mind,\\nin spite of the disappointment of not finding the change he expected in\\nhimself, Levin had been all the while joyfully conscious of the fulness\\nof his heart.\\n\\nAfter the rain it was too wet to go for a walk; besides, the storm\\nclouds still hung about the horizon, and gathered here and there, black\\nand thundery, on the rim of the sky. The whole party spent the rest of\\nthe day in the house.\\n\\nNo more discussions sprang up; on the contrary, after dinner everyone\\nwas in the most amiable frame of mind.\\n\\nAt first Katavasov amused the ladies by his original jokes, which\\nalways pleased people on their first acquaintance with him. Then Sergey\\nIvanovitch induced him to tell them about the very interesting\\nobservations he had made on the habits and characteristics of common\\nhouseflies, and their life. Sergey Ivanovitch, too, was in good\\nspirits, and at tea his brother drew him on to explain his views of the\\nfuture of the Eastern question, and he spoke so simply and so well,\\nthat everyone listened eagerly.\\n\\nKitty was the only one who did not hear it all—she was summoned to give\\nMitya his bath.\\n\\nA few minutes after Kitty had left the room she sent for Levin to come\\nto the nursery.\\n\\nLeaving his tea, and regretfully interrupting the interesting\\nconversation, and at the same time uneasily wondering why he had been\\nsent for, as this only happened on important occasions, Levin went to\\nthe nursery.\\n\\nAlthough he had been much interested by Sergey Ivanovitch’s views of\\nthe new epoch in history that would be created by the emancipation of\\nforty millions of men of Slavonic race acting with Russia, a conception\\nquite new to him, and although he was disturbed by uneasy wonder at\\nbeing sent for by Kitty, as soon as he came out of the drawing-room and\\nwas alone, his mind reverted at once to the thoughts of the morning.\\nAnd all the theories of the significance of the Slav element in the\\nhistory of the world seemed to him so trivial compared with what was\\npassing in his own soul, that he instantly forgot it all and dropped\\nback into the same frame of mind that he had been in that morning.\\n\\nHe did not, as he had done at other times, recall the whole train of\\nthought—that he did not need. He fell back at once into the feeling\\nwhich had guided him, which was connected with those thoughts, and he\\nfound that feeling in his soul even stronger and more definite than\\nbefore. He did not, as he had had to do with previous attempts to find\\ncomforting arguments, need to revive a whole chain of thought to find\\nthe feeling. Now, on the contrary, the feeling of joy and peace was\\nkeener than ever, and thought could not keep pace with feeling.\\n\\nHe walked across the terrace and looked at two stars that had come out\\nin the darkening sky, and suddenly he remembered. “Yes, looking at the\\nsky, I thought that the dome that I see is not a deception, and then I\\nthought something, I shirked facing something,” he mused. “But whatever\\nit was, there can be no disproving it! I have but to think, and all\\nwill come clear!”\\n\\nJust as he was going into the nursery he remembered what it was he had\\nshirked facing. It was that if the chief proof of the Divinity was His\\nrevelation of what is right, how is it this revelation is confined to\\nthe Christian church alone? What relation to this revelation have the\\nbeliefs of the Buddhists, Mohammedans, who preached and did good too?\\n\\nIt seemed to him that he had an answer to this question; but he had not\\ntime to formulate it to himself before he went into the nursery.\\n\\nKitty was standing with her sleeves tucked up over the baby in the\\nbath. Hearing her husband’s footstep, she turned towards him, summoning\\nhim to her with her smile. With one hand she was supporting the fat\\nbaby that lay floating and sprawling on its back, while with the other\\nshe squeezed the sponge over him.\\n\\n“Come, look, look!” she said, when her husband came up to her. “Agafea\\nMihalovna’s right. He knows us!”\\n\\nMitya had on that day given unmistakable, incontestable signs of\\nrecognizing all his friends.\\n\\nAs soon as Levin approached the bath, the experiment was tried, and it\\nwas completely successful. The cook, sent for with this object, bent\\nover the baby. He frowned and shook his head disapprovingly. Kitty bent\\ndown to him, he gave her a beaming smile, propped his little hands on\\nthe sponge and chirruped, making such a queer little contented sound\\nwith his lips, that Kitty and the nurse were not alone in their\\nadmiration. Levin, too, was surprised and delighted.\\n\\nThe baby was taken out of the bath, drenched with water, wrapped in\\ntowels, dried, and after a piercing scream, handed to his mother.\\n\\n“Well, I am glad you are beginning to love him,” said Kitty to her\\nhusband, when she had settled herself comfortably in her usual place,\\nwith the baby at her breast. “I am so glad! It had begun to distress\\nme. You said you had no feeling for him.”\\n\\n“No; did I say that? I only said I was disappointed.”\\n\\n“What! disappointed in him?”\\n\\n“Not disappointed in him, but in my own feeling; I had expected more. I\\nhad expected a rush of new delightful emotion to come as a surprise.\\nAnd then instead of that—disgust, pity....”\\n\\nShe listened attentively, looking at him over the baby, while she put\\nback on her slender fingers the rings she had taken off while giving\\nMitya his bath.\\n\\n“And most of all, at there being far more apprehension and pity than\\npleasure. Today, after that fright during the storm, I understand how I\\nlove him.”\\n\\nKitty’s smile was radiant.\\n\\n“Were you very much frightened?” she said. “So was I too, but I feel it\\nmore now that it’s over. I’m going to look at the oak. How nice\\nKatavasov is! And what a happy day we’ve had altogether. And you’re so\\nnice with Sergey Ivanovitch, when you care to be.... Well, go back to\\nthem. It’s always so hot and steamy here after the bath 19\\n\\nGoing out of the nursery and being again alone, Levin went back at once\\nto the thought, in which there was something not clear.\\n\\nInstead of going into the drawing-room, where he heard voices, he\\nstopped on the terrace, and leaning his elbows on the parapet, he gazed\\nup at the sky.\\n\\nIt was quite dark now, and in the south, where he was looking, there\\nwere no clouds. The storm had drifted on to the opposite side of the\\nsky, and there were flashes of lightning and distant thunder from that\\nquarter. Levin listened to the monotonous drip from the lime trees in\\nthe garden, and looked at the triangle of stars he knew so well, and\\nthe Milky Way with its branches that ran through its midst. At each\\nflash of lightning the Milky Way, and even the bright stars, vanished,\\nbut as soon as the lightning died away, they reappeared in their places\\nas though some hand had flung them back with careful aim.\\n\\n“Well, what is it perplexes me?” Levin said to himself, feeling\\nbeforehand that the solution of his difficulties was ready in his soul,\\nthough he did not know it yet. “Yes, the one unmistakable,\\nincontestable manifestation of the Divinity is the law of right and\\nwrong, which has come into the world by revelation, and which I feel in\\nmyself, and in the recognition of which—I don’t make myself, but\\nwhether I will or not—I am made one with other men in one body of\\nbelievers, which is called the church. Well, but the Jews, the\\nMohammedans, the Confucians, the Buddhists—what of them?” he put to\\nhimself the question he had feared to face. “Can these hundreds of\\nmillions of men be deprived of that highest blessing without which life\\nhas no meaning?” He pondered a moment, but immediately corrected\\nhimself. “But what am I questioning?” he said to himself. “I am\\nquestioning the relation to Divinity of all the different religions of\\nall mankind. I am questioning the universal manifestation of God to all\\nthe world with all those misty blurs. What am I about? To me\\nindividually, to my heart has been revealed a knowledge beyond all\\ndoubt, and unattainable by reason, and here I am obstinately trying to\\nexpress that knowledge in reason and words.\\n\\n“Don’t I know that the stars don’t move?” he asked himself, gazing at\\nthe bright planet which had shifted its position up to the topmost twig\\nof the birch-tree. “But looking at the movements of the stars, I can’t\\npicture to myself the rotation of the earth, and I’m right in saying\\nthat the stars move.\\n\\n“And could the astronomers have understood and calculated anything, if\\nthey had taken into account all the complicated and varied motions of\\nthe earth? All the marvelous conclusions they have reached about the\\ndistances, weights, movements, and deflections of the heavenly bodies\\nare only founded on the apparent motions of the heavenly bodies about a\\nstationary earth, on that very motion I see before me now, which has\\nbeen so for millions of men during long ages, and was and will be\\nalways alike, and can always be trusted. And just as the conclusions of\\nthe astronomers would have been vain and uncertain if not founded on\\nobservations of the seen heavens, in relation to a single meridian and\\na single horizon, so would my conclusions be vain and uncertain if not\\nfounded on that conception of right, which has been and will be always\\nalike for all men, which has been revealed to me as a Christian, and\\nwhich can always be trusted in my soul. The question of other religions\\nand their relations to Divinity I have no right to decide, and no\\npossibility of deciding.”\\n\\n“Oh, you haven’t gone in then?” he heard Kitty’s voice all at once, as\\nshe came by the same way to the drawing-room.\\n\\n“What is it? you’re not worried about anything?” she said, looking\\nintently at his face in the starlight.\\n\\nBut she could not have seen his face if a flash of lightning had not\\nhidden the stars and revealed it. In that flash she saw his face\\ndistinctly, and seeing him calm and happy, she smiled at him.\\n\\n“She understands,” he thought; “she knows what I’m thinking about.\\nShall I tell her or not? Yes, I’ll tell her.” But at the moment he was\\nabout to speak, she began speaking.\\n\\n“Kostya! do something for me,” she said; “go into the corner room and\\nsee if they’ve made it all right for Sergey Ivanovitch. I can’t very\\nwell. See if they’ve put the new wash stand in it.”\\n\\n“Very well, I’ll go directly,” said Levin, standing up and kissing her.\\n\\n“No, I’d better not speak of it,” he thought, when she had gone in\\nbefore him. “It is a secret for me alone, of vital importance for me,\\nand not to be put into words.\\n\\n“This new feeling has not changed me, has not made me happy and\\nenlightened all of a sudden, as I had dreamed, just like the feeling\\nfor my child. There was no surprise in this either. Faith—or not\\nfaith—I don’t know what it is—but this feeling has come just as\\nimperceptibly through suffering, and has taken firm root in my soul.\\n\\n“I shall go on in the same way, losing my temper with Ivan the\\ncoachman, falling into angry discussions, expressing my opinions\\ntactlessly; there will be still the same wall between the holy of\\nholies of my soul and other people, even my wife; I shall still go on\\nscolding her for my own terror, and being remorseful for it; I shall\\nstill be as unable to understand with my reason why I pray, and I shall\\nstill go on praying; but my life now, my whole life apart from anything\\nthat can happen to me, every minute of it is no more meaningless, as it\\nwas before, but it has the positive meaning of goodness, which I have\\nthe power to put into it.”'"

    "#book = \"Once upon a time there lived a King and a Queen, who lacked but one thing on earth to make them entirely happy. The King was young, handsome, and wealthy; the Queen had a nature as good and gentle as her face was beautiful; and they adored one another, having married for love—which among kings and queens is not always the rule. Moreover, they reigned over a kingdom at peace, and their people were devoted to them. What more, then, could they possibly want? Well, they wanted one thing very badly, and the lack of it grieved them more than words can tell. They had no child. Vows, pilgrimages, all ways were tried; yet for a long while nothing came of it all, and the poor Queen especially was in despair. At last, however, to her own and her husband's inexpressible joy, she gave birth to a daughter. As soon as the palace guns announced this event, the whole nation went wild with delight.\""
