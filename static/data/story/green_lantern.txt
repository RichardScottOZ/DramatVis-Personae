* [first lines]
*Tomar-Re: [voice over] Billions of years ago, a race of immortals harnessed the most powerful force in existence. The emerald energy of willpower. These immortals, the guardians of the universe, built a world from where they could watch over all of existence; the planet Oa. They divided the universe into three thousands six hundred sectors. A ring powered by the energy of will were sent to every sector of universe to select a recruit. In order to be chosen by the ring, it was said one must be without fear. Together these three thousand six hundred recruits form the intergalactic peace keepers known as The Green Lantern Corps. Of all the threats the Corp ever faced, the gravest was an entity of fear, known as Parallax. Only the legendary Green Lantern, Abin Sur, was capable of capturing and imprisoning this beast. Which he did on the lost planet of Ryut.
*Abin Sur: I’m gravely wounded. Heading to the nearest inhabitant planet for the selection process. Tell the guardians, it’s Parallax.
*[to the woman he’s woken up next to]
*Hal Jordan: Sorry! Gotta run. Make yourself at home, okay? There’s, uh…water in the tap.
*Carol Ferris: Never mind that you crashed a brand new F-35, you broke the rules of engagement! You sacrificed your wing man. And you ruined the contract that this company and half the statements depend on.
*Hal Jordan: I’m sorry. I thought that this was a dog fight. I was under the impression that the objective was to win.
*Bob Banks: The objective was to show what the Sabers could do in actual combat. And in combat, no pilot is going to crater his own plane.
*Hal Jordan: I did. Now you know you gotta boost the ceiling and your robots. I also showed you what they can’t do.
*Carol Ferris: You didn’t have to make that point in front of the commander of air force acquisitions! Since I’m going to have to lay off most of my company anyway, you’re fired!
*Hal Jordan: It’s too late, Carl. I quit. Thank you for the opportunity. I appreciate it.
*Carol Ferris: You don’t get out that easy! He’s not fired! And you don’t quit! You’re grounded, pending the results of an investigation.
*Bob Banks: Watch your back.
*Hal Jordan: That’s impossible, Bob.
*Carol Ferris: Wanna tell me what happened up there?
*Hal Jordan: The controls locked up.
*Carol Ferris: Don’t give me that, Hal. You had a window and you could have recovered. Did you choke? You wouldn’t be the first pilot it happened to, and I know…
*Hal Jordan: The controls locked up! What the hell is all this, anyway, huh? What’s with the ridiculous suit? I know that you dad’s been bucking for you take over the company, but this is taking it a little too far!
*Carol Ferris: The matters of my career choice are not on the table right now!
*Hal Jordan: You’re a…you’re a pilot, Carol! And a good one. Giving that up to fly for a God damn desk is bullshit!
*Carol Ferris: Hal, I like the business part. And I’m good at! Which by the way doesn’t mean I’ll never get in a cock-pit again. It isn’t one way or the other. That’s a way a child looks at things and we aren’t children anymore. I just don’t wanna see someone I care about getting hurt. Least of all you.
*Hal Jordan: This is the worst eleventh Birthday party I’ve ever been to. There’s no dancing girls…
*[Jason hugs Hal tightly]
*Hal Jordan: Hey! Hey, I’m fine.
*Jason Jordan: I guess I got a little freaked out or something.
*Hal Jordan: It happens.
*Jason Jordan: Not to you.
*Hal Jordan: Look, I told you that you don’t have anything to worry about. You wanna know why? I may be a total screw up in every other part of my life, but the one thing I do know how to do is fly.
*Jason Jordan: What happened today? I mean, when you crashed?
*Hal Jordan: I’m not really sure exactly.
*Jason Jordan: Were you scared?
*Hal Jordan: It’s my job not to be.
*[after Hal has gotten him out of his spaceship and he’s lying wounded]
*Abin Sur: Your name? Your name?
*Hal Jordan: It’s Hal. Hal Jordan.
*Abin Sur: Hal Jordan, I am Abin Sur. Protector of sector thirty eight…
*Hal Jordan: Okay! Hey! Hey! Hey! Listen? We’re gonna get you to a hospital, okay? Okay? What about…what…what about all this purple blood.
*[Abin Sur places the green ring in Hal’s hand]
*Abin Sur: The ring, it chose you. Take it. Place the ring the lantern. Place the ring. Sweep the earth. Great honor. Responsible.
*Hal Jordan: What? I don’t understand!
*[after Hal has called Tom over to pick him up]
*Hal Jordan: We can’t stay here.
*Thomas Kalmaku: What?
*Hal Jordan: Gotta go.
*[Tom looks over at the dead body of Abin Sur]
*Thomas Kalmaku: What uh…?
*Hal Jordan: A pilot. He wore a uniform. I think he was a soldier. He gave me this.
*[he hold up the ring]
*Thomas Kalmaku: He proposed?
*Hal Jordan: He said, the ring chose me. He said, it’s a great honor. Responsibility.
*Thomas Kalmaku: Responsibility?
*Hal Jordan: Yeah.
*Thomas Kalmaku: You?
*[to the Guardians]
*Sinestro: A great light has gone out in the universe. Abin Sur is dead. Four of my knighthood brothers killed. The inhabitants of two worlds annihilated by an unknown enemy. An enemy that possesses they yellow power of fear. We know that it originated from somewhere within the lost sector. We know it grows more powerful with each encounter. According to Abin Sur’s last transmission, he seemed to know what he was. His only words were; it’s Parallax.
*Guardian #1: We are aware of the threat. We are assessing the situation.
*Sinestro: While you assess, innocent lives will be lost. Let me take the fight to this new enemy.
*Guardian #2: There is much of which you are not aware, Sinestro.
*Guardian #1: If the danger is as great as we suspect.
*Sinestro: What are you saying? You believe this enemy can defeat us?
*[the Guardians do not answer]
*Sinestro: Guardians, if your faith in our power has faltered let me re-new it. Let me take a squadron of my strongest Lanterns against this enemy, and I’ll prove to you, our best days are not behind us.
*[talking to himself trying to figure out how the ring works]
*Hal Jordan: Okay. All right. Place the ring and speak the oath. The oath. Cause everybody knows the oath. Used to sing it camp.
*[he puts his ringed finger close to the lantern]
*Hal Jordan: I, Hal Jordan, do solemnly swear to pledge allegiance to a lantern, that I got from a dying purple alien in a swamp.
*[talking to himself trying to get the lantern to work]
*Hal Jordan: To infinity and beyond. By the power of Greyskull!
*[frustrated that the lantern is not responding]
*Hal Jordan: What the hell! Come on! If you can find me a hundred miles in the middle of nowhere, you…
*[he touches the lantern and the lantern suddenly lights up]
*Hal Jordan: In brightest day, in blackest night. No evil shall escape my sight. Let those who worship evils might, beware of my power. The Green Lantern’s light! I, uh…I’m really sorry.
*Carol Ferris: Did you just apologize? You haven’t been replaced by an alien or something?
*Hal Jordan: No! I’m good.
*[slaps himself in the face]
*Hal Jordan: I’m good. I’m good. Totally good. I uh…do you think I’m irresponsible?
*[Carol laughs]
*Hal Jordan: No need to answer this. It’s fine.
*[drinking at a bar]
*Hal Jordan: We…we haven’t been in this place together since…that night.
*Carol Ferris: You forgot it was my Birthday.
*Hal Jordan: Did I?
*Carol Ferris: Mm-hmm.
*Hal Jordan: That was also the night, the first time we made…flew together.
*Carol Ferris: Well, you’ve been flying ever since, with anyone who’ll get into a plane.
*[whilst dancing]
*Hal Jordan: I really am sorry.
*Carol Ferris: It’s okay. Our contract isn’t quite dead yet. I told you I was good at this.
*Hal Jordan: I wasn’t talking about the contract. I would have screwed this up. Yeah. Even if I didn’t go to air force, I would have found some way to, you know, blow it.
*Carol Ferris: Is that what you tell yourself.
*Hal Jordan: Mm-hmm.
*Carol Ferris: You know what I spent my afternoon doing?
*Hal Jordan: What?
*Carol Ferris: Worrying about you. Hal, I went over every inch of the flight data. There was nothing wrong with the plane. What happened up there?
*Hal Jordan: Thanks for the dance.
*[he walks away from her and out of the bar]
*[arriving on planet Oa, Hal sees himself in the Green Lantern uniform for the first time]
*Tomar-Re: Have you concluded admiring yourself?
*Hal Jordan: Uhhh…yeah!
*Tomar-Re: Well, your ring translator is functioning properly.
*[Hal’s green face mask suddenly disappears]
*Tomar-Re: Your mask will appear when protection of your identity is required. There is no need for it on Oa.
*[referring to Tomar-Re looking like a fish]
*Hal Jordan: Talking fish.
*Tomar-Re: Actually my race is Xudarian. Our DNA does somewhat resemble your amoebic theological species. I am Tomar-Re, protector of sector of two-eight-one-three and home to…
*Hal Jordan: Eighty thousand twelve galaxies. Two point-three-four million species. How do I know that?
*Tomar-Re: The induction process. It activates the ring’s higher function, including a working knowledge of dates. In truth we were curious, the process had never been attempted on the species as young as humans before. You are the first to be chosen. I have been sent to work on you here.
*Hal Jordan: And here is?
*[showing Hal planet Oa]
*Tomar-Re: Welcome to Oa. This planet has been our home for countless millennium. It was created for us by the Guardians.
*Hal Jordan: The Guardians?
*[referring to the Guardians]
*Tomar-Re: They are immortals among the most ancient of races. They made all you see and are responsible for all we are and do. Since time and memory, the Green Lantern Corps has served as the keepers of peace, order and justice throughout the universe. To be chosen to join its ranks is the highest of honors, and the greatest of responsibilities.
*Hal Jordan: Yeah. Yeah, that part I heard about.
*Tomar-Re: We’re going to fly now.
*Hal Jordan: Fly?
*Tomar-Re: Absolutely.
*Hal Jordan: All right! I can do that.
*[Tomar-Re floats above]
*Tomar-Re: Join me?
*Hal Jordan: I can do that.
*[as they’re flying Hal sees a giant flash of green light streaming across the planet]
*Hal Jordan: What is that?
*Tomar-Re: It’s the energy that’s generated from the central battery. It’s power comes from the will of every living creature in the universe. It in turn charges your lantern, which in turn charges your ring. Even your suit is comprised entirely of energy.
*Hal Jordan: What’s with all the green?
*Tomar-Re: Green’s the color of will. The Guardians harassed will, because it’s the strongest source of energy in the universe.
*[to Hal, as they join the group of the Green Lanterns Corps]
*Tomar-Re: The stars you can see from your home planet on the clearest night. Your sector is a thousand times larger. And three-thousand-six-hundred lanterns each with a sector, just as vast.
*[addressing the Green Lanterns]
*Sinestro: Lanterns, I called you here to this unprecedented gathering because we face an unprecedented danger. Our four Lantern brothers were killed by an enemy called, Parallax. And enemy we don’t yet fully understand. We do know it’s powerful enough to destroy higher civilizations. Powerful enough to defeat even Abin Sur, our finest warrior. His light can never be replaced.
*[there’s a mumbling in the crowd of lanterns]
*Sinestro: The Guardians have charged me to lead a squadron of our strongest Lanterns in an assault on Parallax. We will seek out and find this enemy. And we will destroy it. Alone we are now vulnerable. United we are still invincible. We have never been defeated. Will we be defeated now?
*[the Lanterns all shout no]
*Sinestro: It was for this moment that we were created. But I don’t need to tell you your duty. I don’t need to tell you who we are.
*[showing Hal what the ring can do]
*Tomar-Re: Your will turns thought into reality. To master the ring, you must learn to focus your will and create what you see with your mind. The ring’s limits are only what you can imagine.
*[as Hal is practicing using his ring]
*Tomar-Re: The ring will inform you where there is an imminent threat.
*[suddenly there’s a flash of light which lifts Hal and throws him to the ground]
*Tomar-Re: This particular threat’s name is Kilowog. He’ll be your combat training officer.
*[suddenly Kilowog jumps in front of Hal]
*Kilowog: Never let your guard down, looser. Welcome to ring slinger one-o-one. Or as I like to call it; the worst day of your worthless life.
*[referring to himself]
*Kilowog: The human, he never seen one before.
*[he leans down and sniffs Hal]
*Kilowog: You smell funny.
*Hal Jordan: [sarcastically] I smell funny?
*Kilowog: Yeah, I heard about humans. Think you’re the center of the universe. You wanna be a Lantern? You gotta come into the Corps.
*[to Hal as he’s training him to use his ring to protect himself against threat]
*Kilowog: Your constructs are only gonna be as strong as your will. And your will is pathetic! I’m gonna work you, and I’m gonna hit you until your will is stronger and be worthy of the Corps.
*[to Hal; seeing him for the first time]
*Sinestro: So, this is the human. When I learned Abin Sur’s ring had chosen you, I said there had to be a mistake. I see nothing to change my mind. The Corps, is only strong as its weakest link. And I will tolerate no weakness. You understand me? Are you afraid human?
*[Hal doesn’t answer]
*Sinestro: Are you afraid?
*[he pushes Hal]
*Hal Jordan: No. No, don’t do that.
*Sinestro: Shall we?
*Hal Jordan: Sure.
*[Hal uses his ring to brings up a sword as his weapon]
*Sinestro: A sword? How human.
*[Sinestro uses his ring to form two swords and they start fighting]
*[to Hal as they are fighting]
*Sinestro: I’m a Green Lantern. I fear nothing. Fear is the enemy of will. Will is what makes you take action. Fear is what stops you and makes you weak.
*[to Hal as they are fighting]
*Sinestro: You must ignore your fear. When you’re afraid you can’t act. You can’t act, you can’t defend. You don’t defend, you die!
*[as he’s defeated Hal and Hal looks at him with fear]
*Sinestro: You wreak of fear, Hal Jordan. Abin Sur was a great warrior. My mentor. A friend. You, insult his memory by wearing his ring.
*[after Sinestro has beaten him and shown him his weakness during their fight]
*Hal Jordan: I’m done. He’s right. I’m only human. We’re not here to defend the universe. Up until a few days ago, we thought we were the only ones in the universe.
*Tomar-Re: The ring chose you. It wouldn’t have done so if it hadn’t seen something in you.
*Hal Jordan: Oh, yeah?
*Tomar-Re: Something you yourself don’t yet see. The ring never makes a mistake.
*Hal Jordan: This time it did.
*[to the Guardians]
*Sinestro: With my own eyes, I saw this creature use fear in our finest warriors and feed on that fear. There’s more, we’ve tracked it’s trajectory. Parallax is headed for Oa. Never before has an enemy dared attack us here. You must tell me what you know.
*Guardian #1: Will has always been our sole weapon against the forces of darkness in the universe. But as that power began to seem insufficient, a great debate arose among us. Should we exploit another source of power? One we have long since sworn should never be used; fear. But the power of fear was too unpredictable. The chance of corruption too great. And so we decided against it. All of us that is, except one. Alone, this Guardian entered the forbidden chamber. He wanted to prove the light of fear could be mastered. His intentions were pure, but his hopes were naive. Consumed by the yellow power of fear, the Guardian became the very evil he had wished to destroy. He became Parallax.
*Guardian #1: For the universe’s safety and his own, Abin Sur was charged with imprisoning Parallax in the lost sector. But he escaped, feeding on the fear of others. He grew larger, more powerful.
*Sinestro: And he’s now headed here to take his revenge on you and destroy the Corps. Then we have no choice. We must prepare to harness the power of our enemy and fight fear with fear. To protect our sectors we must be able to defend ourselves. We must forge a yellow ring.
*Senator Hammond: Hal Jordan. Worst pilot I’ve ever seen, or the best? I’m not quite sure.
*Hal Jordan: I’ve been called both, sir.
*Senator Hammond: Glad you could make it, son.
*Hal Jordan: Frankly, I was a little surprised I got the invite.
*Senator Hammond: Well, you’re family, Hal. You know, I always say there are thinkers in this world and there are doers. And you are one of the doers.
*Hal Jordan: Yeah, but you know the thinkers make what I do possible. I wouldn’t have a plane to fly in, unless someone thought it up.
*Senator Hammond: Well, of course.
*[walking over to Carol, who’s looking at an aircraft]
*Hal Jordan: Nice!
*Carol Ferris: Yeah. My dad used to train on them.
*Hal Jordan: I was talking about your dress.
*[she looks at him]
*Carol Ferris: Nice jacket. Last time I checked you didn’t even own one.
*Hal Jordan: Yeah, I’ve been shaking up the wardrobe lately. Congratulation on the contract. How’d you manage to pull that off?
*Carol Ferris: I pointed out, you only won because you broke the rules of engagement. And Tom figured out how you disintegrated in such high altitude. So, I guess in a way, without even meaning to, you actually did us a favor.
*Hal Jordan: [sarcastically] Look, I’m uncomfortable with the word hero.
*[the next morning after Hal has used his Green Lantern powers to save Senator Hammond and Carol from helicopter crash at the party]
*Thomas Kalmaku: A race track?
*Hal Jordan: Yeah.
*Thomas Kalmaku: Mmm. That’s the best you could come up with for your first big appearance. Nice job.
*Hal Jordan: Oh! I’m sorry. Did I disappoint you? I materialized a race track out of pure energy, saving hundreds of people, and your disappointed. I’m…I’m sorry about that.
Thomas Kalmaku: I wanna see this stuff. You’re gonna have to show me.
*Hal Jordan: Oh, I don’t think that’s a good idea.
*Thomas Kalmaku: Come on! I wanna see this stuff! You know? I wanna see the outfit, the flying. You gotta show me.
*Hal Jordan: I’m sitting here in my pajamas. What do you want me to do?
*Thomas Kalmaku: I love you, but being your best friend is no picnic.
*Hal Jordan: It’s for emergencies!
*Thomas Kalmaku: You called me! Hal, I wanna sit it!
*Hal Jordan: Fine! Hold on to your glasses. Question. You ready to have your mind blown?
Thomas Kalmaku: Yeah.
*Hal Jordan: Ring. Finger.
*[he puts the ring on his finger]
*Hal Jordan: Here we go.
*[he spreads his arms trying to make his costume appear but nothing happens]
*Thomas Kalmaku: Did you break it already?
*Hal Jordan: Hey! I didn’t break it. It’s just…it’s just out of juice. I need to recharge it.
*[he takes the lantern and places the ring in front of it charging it with green light]
*Hal Jordan: Now pay attention.
*[he spreads his arms again and he’s suddenly in his green suit and mask]
*Thomas Kalmaku: Ah! Green! Wow!
*Hal Jordan: I know! Right?
*[they both laugh]
*Hal Jordan: Not bad, huh?
*Thomas Kalmaku: You’re a super hero! Don’t they always get the girl?
*[floating outside Carol’s office in his Green Lantern suit and mask]
*Hal Jordan: Evening, ma’am. Didn’t get a chance to say goodbye. Are you okay?
*Carol Ferris: Ah, No. I’m…I’m good. So yes, thank you.
*Hal Jordan: Just doing my job. No thanks necessary, miss.
*Carol Ferris: No. It…it is. You saved my life. You saved all of our lives. It was a very…
*[she comes up and stands close to him and suddenly recognizes him]
*Carol Ferris: Hal?
*Hal Jordan: Yeah.
*Carol Ferris: Hal?! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Hal!
*Hal Jordan: How did you know it was me?
*Carol Ferris: What do you mean? I’ve known you my whole life! I’ve seen you naked! You don’t think I would recognize you cause I can only see your cheek bones. What is this? Why…why is your skin green? Why are you glowing? What the hell is with that mask?
*Hal Jordan: It came with the outfit.
*[she gives him a look]
*Hal Jordan: Cool, huh?
*[explaining what he can do with the ring]
*Hal Jordan: Anything I see in my mind I can create. I just have to focus.
*Carol Ferris: Anything?
*Hal Jordan: Anything. Well, technically speaking um…I actually sort of uh…quit.
*Carol Ferris: What do you mean? How?
*Hal Jordan: Well I mean, it’s…it’s a lot like quitting anything else, really.
*Carol Ferris: I don’t understand. How…how do you walk away from something like that? Is it…is it even possible?
*Hal Jordan: I think we both know I’m pretty good at walking away.
*Carol Ferris: If for once you didn’t quit something you about, what’s the worst that could happen? Well, thank you. This has been really…
*Hal Jordan: I know I’ve made a lot of mistakes.
*Carol Ferris: Look Hal, I’m not mad at you. I feel bad for you, really. You’ve been given so much, so often. I just…Goodnight.
*[after Hector’s face has transformed]
*Hector Hammond: Dad.
*Senator Hammond: Son, this is my fault. But I’m gonna fix it. We’re gonna get you well again. Whatever it takes.
*Hector Hammond: I don’t know what you’re talking about.
*Dr. Amanda Waller: We did hector traces of the second alien life form buried within the body of the first. You’ve been exposed.
*Hector Hammond: I have never felt better in my life.
*Senator Hammond: We know everything, son.
*[suddenly Hector grabs hold of his father’s face]
*Hector Hammond: I’ve never felt better in my life.
*[to Hal after they’ve fought each other]
*Hector Hammond: You’re just as much of a failure as I was. And just as afraid. What a load…I used to fight my fear. But then I…then I tasted its true power. I’ll never go back!
*[Hector levitates his father using his power, throws him across the lab and sets him on fire]
*[speaking to Hal as he puts his ring on Hector’s forehead]
*Parallax: You wear the ring of the Lantern that imprisoned me. You will suffer the same fate. Once I have devoured your world, I will have all the strength I need to defeat the Corps and destroy the Guardians.
*Thomas Kalmaku: Let me get this straight. This thing that’s out there, attacking planets, is connected to Hector?
*Hal Jordan: Somehow it infected him after it killed Abin Sur.
*Carol Ferris: Well, you’re just gonna have to stop it.
*Hal Jordan: Oh, just gonna have to stop it! Well, I tried that and I failed and the Senator died. I told you the ring made a mistake.
*Carol Ferris: Wait, go back. How did the ring make a mistake?
*Hal Jordan: The one thing that a Green Lantern is supposed to be is fearless. Fearless, is the job description. That isn’t me.
*Carol Ferris: So you’re just gonna walk away again? Explain this to me, Hal. Please explain to me, just once, why?
*Hal Jordan: Because I’m afraid!
*Carol Ferris: You don’t think your dad never felt afraid?
*Hal Jordan: If he did, he figured some way to beat it.
*Carol Ferris: Mmm, yeah. Well, there’s a word for that. Courage.
*Hal Jordan: He said that the ring wouldn’t have chosen me if it didn’t see something. Something I don’t see…yet.
*Carol Ferris: I see it. I always have. The ring didn’t see that you were fearless, it saw that you had the ability to overcome fear. It saw that you were courageous. Which you are. You’re just like your dad.
*[to the Guardians as he holds a new ring]
*Sinestro: Our new weapon is ready. Once I’ve mastered it’s power, I’ll begin training the Corps to do the same. Their worth will be lost. We’ll be ready to make a stand against Parallax before it reaches Oa. And the power of the enemy will be ours.
*Hal Jordan: At what cost?
*Sinestro: You dare enter this chamber?
*Hal Jordan: I need your help. You gotta help me save my world.
*[to the Guardians]
*Hal Jordan: I know that humans aren’t as strong as other species, or the smartest. We’re young, we have a lot to learn. But we’re worth saving.
*[the Guardians do not answer]
*Hal Jordan: This new weapon of yours, you can’t use it. Once you’ve crossed that line, once you’ve given into fear, you’ll never go back. I’ve seen it. Look, I know right now you’re afraid.
*Guardian #1: You dare accuse the Guardians of feeling fear?
*Hal Jordan: Yes, I do. And that’s exactly why Parallax is beating you. Because you’re afraid to even admit you’re afraid! I know. I spent my entire life doing it. You know, we have a saying on earth, we say; I’m only human. We say it because we’re vulnerable. We say it because we know we’re afraid. But it doesn’t mean we’re weak. Help me save my planet. Don’t give in to fear. Fight it! Fight it with me!
*Guardian #2: You’re words are compelling, young human. But as immortals we must measure our actions over billions of years and the fate of the universe. We simply cannot risk losing everything on the chance you might be right.
*Hal Jordan: Then don’t. Don’t risk anymore lives. Just mine. Let me go fight for my world and I’ll show you that will is stronger than fear.
*Sinestro: There is no way that you could succeed. You will die, Hal Jordan.
*Hal Jordan: Then I’ll die trying.
*Sinestro: Good luck, Green Lantern.
*[referring to an unconscious Carol as he levitates her with a syringe floating by her throat]
*Hector Hammond: She’s beautiful, isn’t she? I loved her from the moment I first saw her. But she could never see me, cause you were always in the way. But not anymore.
*[Hector uses his power to bring the syringe closer Carol’s throat]
*Hal Jordan: No! No! Don’t! Don’t do this, Hector! Please. Please. I know how you feel.
*Hector Hammond: Come on! Look at yourself?
*Hal Jordan: No, I know what it’s like. To not live up to expectations. To feel like nothing that you do will ever be good enough.
*[he takes off his ring and the Green Lantern costume is gone, he’s back in his own clothes]
*Hal Jordan: I know what it’s like to be afraid. Let me help you?
*Hector Hammond: Hal, you’ve changed. How wonderful that all it took for you to grow up was the end of the world.
*Hector Hammond: If I can’t be like you, I’ll make her like me.
*[referring to the Carol]
*Hector Hammond: And let’s face it. Once she’s like me, then you won’t ever be interested. Mmm? Or will you?
*Hal Jordan: Why can’t you?
*Hector Hammond: Mmm?
*Hal Jordan: Why can’t you be like me?
*Hector Hammond: Huh?
*Hal Jordan: Let her go. And you can have it.
*[he hold out his ring]
*Hal Jordan: You can do anything. Be anything. Take it? Let her make the choice.
*Hector Hammond: Okay.
*[referring to Carol after Hector has taken his ring]
*Hal Jordan: Now bring her down.
*Hector Hammond: Oh! Hal, I lied.
*[he points the ring at Hal and fires a green light but the green light stops in front of Hal]
*Hal Jordan: I lied too. You see the way it works is, you have to be chosen.
*[the green light moves back and hits Hector]
*[referring to Parallax]
*Carol Ferris: You can never beat this. You’ll die!
*Hal Jordan: At least I can get it away from here.
*Carol Ferris: How do you think you’re gonna do that?
*Hal Jordan: I don’t know! I…I don’t know. May I can out…out think it. A dog fight?
*Carol Ferris: Those were a couple of jets.
*Hal Jordan: Unbeatable jets. The ring chose me for a reason. This is why.
*[as Hal is fighting Parallax with his ring]
*Parallax: I feel your fear growing. You will be dead soon.
*Hal Jordan: In brightest day, in blackest night.
*Parallax: When you are gone, I will destroy everything you ever loved.
*Hal Jordan: No evil shall escape my sight.
*Parallax: Your family, your home, your friends will be no more.
*Hal Jordan: Let those who worship evils might
*Parallax: The entire human race will be wiped out because you, Hal Jordan, were afraid.
*Hal Jordan: Beware of my power. The Green Lantern’s light!
*[addressing the crowd of Green Lanterns]
*Sinestro: Though his time of wearing the ring has been brief, Hal Jordan’s defeat of Parallax will be remembered as long as the Corps exists. His actions are a reminder of why the ring chose each of us. To overcome fear and destroy evil where ever it may hide.
*[to Hal]
*Sinestro: As Lanterns we must fight with all our will. Our wills haven’t always been united. It’s time they were.
*[Kilowog hits Hal in the back]
*Kilowog: Can I train him? Or can I train him?
*Sinestro: You’re impertinent, Hal Jordan. You’re rash, volatile, opinionated. It seems Abin Sur found another just like himself.
*[as he puts on his ring and he transforms into his Green Lantern costume]
*Carol Ferris: Wow! I’m never getting used to that.
*Hal Jordan: My new job requires that I…that I travel. Be away for a while. Away. Never gone.
*[he goes to kiss her]
